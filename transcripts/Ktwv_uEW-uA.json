  "transcript": "spent two years of your life dedicated this book we blew the launch out of the water so what now today we're going to be going to four different podcasts to talk about what's next for the brand and Beyond thank you oh it's your last one I'm not gonna do that too no no I will never take a man's last piece of gum no it's crude and unusual thank you hello the last piece is always a holy piece I would have done this with him and like split it late in the stop yeah let's rock your wedding ring is rubber yeah the other ring it was like it would get a little tight while I was sleeping and I would end up taking it off while I'm asleep and I'd be like where is it Mark you are ridiculously good at manuals for how to make money but if people don't know how to think and they've got a life structure that doesn't make any sense and they're wasting time on the social media or even just a friend group that is going nowhere fast what advice do you have for them to get back one of my favorite quotes from BF Skinner who's a behavior psychologist from way back in the day was you can lead a horse to water but you can't make a drink he said well if you bleed it out enough and you starve it and you leave it in the sun and you put the water right in front of its mouth he said I can invaritably guarantee that I can make a drink and so if you were to think about yourself as that horse then it's like okay well what is the equivalent of the the bloodletting the dehydration the starving that you can put yourself into get the behavior you want so starving has a negative connotation but we can also starve out the negative things in your life like you can starve the alcohol you can starve the friends and I think the easiest way to do that is to get out of the environment you're in I think this was in atomic habits in Vietnam like I think it was like 10 of troops or something we're taking heroin when they were there in the 70s and they thought there's going to be this massive problem when they came back to the States but when they came back to the States almost no one continued the heroin habit and so going from Vietnam where you're doing heroin to the U.S where you're not doing taking heroin had a 90 success rate whereas the inverse is true of recovery centers in the United States today people go there and 90 of them relapse when they go back home and so the difference is that people were doing heroin in a different environment and then they changed their environment and then they never went back to the environment that they did heroin in to be fair I think the reason a lot of people kind of like some of the content that I put out from a money-making perspective is how can I operationalize this word right so like patience for example is when people throw out a lot but for me defining patience was helpful which is figuring out what to do in the meantime like that's patience like you're like I'm not patient it's like no you just need to figure out what to do in the meantime I think these are like mental models around using emotions to fuel the behaviors that you want so me defining amorphous terms like confidence winning respect loyalty sadness anxiety have come from my own desire to understand the words and reading the dictionary definitions and feeling like they don't provide much and they can't help me what is love and you know people like it's a feeling that that doesn't help me how do I operationalize this word love for me how much are you willing to sacrifice to maintain a relationship that is how you can measure love you could use an example of like man that guy works on that piece of crap car all the time he must really love it right like he's willing to sacrifice a lot to maintain that thing to the same degree many people would sacrifice everything for their kids now there's plenty of times where they don't like their kids but they'd be willing to die for their children you might be willing to die for your country and so when I Define these terms it has been out of my own self-interest to learn how to navigate life better you just did a book launch it was Unreal I mean really like blew people's minds set a standard or what did you demonstrate in the way that you did that that other people don't understand with each book I wanted to demonstrate the concept of the book with the book itself since the concept of the book was to advertise and to get lots of leads then I thought it would be appropriate to advertise and get lots of leads and I used every method in the book I ran ads for it even though I didn't need to run ads we still got 137 000 people from ads we had Affiliates we had 104 000 people there from Affiliates we had 27 000 Affiliates promote the book we had customer referrals people sent their friends there so I had an incentive that if you just get 10 people to come you'll get two bonus chapters that aren't released with the book and so you know the next book I'll try and continue that meta theme of I have Concepts in this book and I will show you that they work because I will use them to Market and promote the book tell me on a nose trip it says b one of zero what does that mean so one of zero is a brand that I am really passionate about the concept one of zero actually came from my media team you know we talk about content in general is one of one content like we try to make content that only we can make and that's actually one of my Big Marketing rules is that say what only you could say show it only you can show as we were approaching the event the team learned more and more about what we were going to be giving away and how much we're putting into it and they're like dude this isn't even one of one this is one of zero and that statement just clicked and then everyone latched on to it because it wasn't about just doing what only we could do it was doing what no one else would do if you look at one of zero one divided by zero from a mathematical perspective it's undefined and I think a lot of that is stuff that I resonate with which is doing work that no one else will do is doing the things that other people will tell you not to do and foregoing the shoulds and the must and the have to's that people around you tell you to do because they want to project their life and their expeditions on yours but you want to live in direct contrast to that because you want to be your own person and be Beyond definition and let your actions be the only thing to Define you one of one is doing the things that only you can do but one of zero is doing things that you're not even sure you can do yet appreciate you man a Chick-fil-A action what is the Chick-fil-A order I go uh 12 count grilled nugs four count fry tenders and then a spicy chicken Deluxe no cheese with Chick-fil-A sauce and ranch that's the go-to if you can only choose between one sauce out of every restaurant it would be uh no it'd be um the Persian yogurt sauce go with the roots yeah I mean it also has nutritional value It's Yogurt it's got protein in it right a little fat it's refreshing what's the sign of a good podcast interview for you number one is my uh rapport with the host if we're comfortable then automatically the conversation is going to be better the second thing is how much they know about me and our stuff if I'm doing like Recaps it's less interesting if I were to do a third and fourth thing it is quality of the follow-on questions because there are some people who have like these are 12 questions that I will ask Alex they ask a question I answer the question then they say question two and then they they don't dive deeper into it which to me makes it almost makes it seem like they're not listening because then it's not a conversation it's really just like 12 short clips the last one uh is really their ability to let silence exist I will say that I have noticed this about the best podcast hosts is that like they will ask a question and then I might answer and they will just they will just sit at the end of that and then give me another second or two and then I might add something to it that might be the the real nugget or crystallization of thinking and if you have a really rushed Cadence in terms of how the conversation is going it becomes more difficult to have thoughtful responses oh wow what's up stud how's it going man good to see you man what have you learned in the last year the hardest work I've done has been my redefining winning I think for me that is like that has been my big unlock for how much effort I can put in to make better and keep pushing so I think one of the hardest things as an entrepreneur or just an individual is Shifting how you define winning for yourself and it's easy to say it and say of course I'm in the game I'm winning it's much harder to actually believe that and so it's easy to make the Instagram clip but it's hard to live it and what's been interesting for me is that I feel like it's unlocked a different level of work ethic I thought that the fear of the gun to your head is still the strongest motivator and it is in the short term but if you need to run a marathon then you need to have something that is going to sustain for a longer period of time like punishment is always stronger the short term reward is always longer in the long term and so we have to redefine uh we reward ourselves for the work we do and so since I don't believe in Legacy and I don't believe that in 5000 years people are going to remember who I am I had to make winning working as hard as I could on something how do you measure working as hard as you can tough I think about a future version of myself who has all the context in my current situation my skills uh the information available to me the resources I have and that man that feature man knows what perfect work looks like which is how much effort can I put into this thing and not be distracted and continue to Chisel away at this project it's very hard because it means there's very few projects that I can do if I have that level of work as my new standard and so if that level of work is the standard and that is what winning is then I can only do it for a few things there's just a lot of things I'm not going to be able to do which is sad in some ways but I think a necessary trade-off because like we have one human life hair band no strip ready I tested a zillion different bags to get the bag that I have I wear one pair of shorts and one beater if I want to conserve space I can do two to one so I can do two beaters per one pair of shorts I can wear shorts twice I know I'm risque I like that I bring no strips and I usually have one flannel or button down that I bring with me and I wear the same shoes that are appropriate in all venues I can wear in the gym I can wear them to a restaurant I can wear them on stage that makes packing take less than a minute for me and that's how I like it and so I can pretty much work until the moment we have to leave and I just throw my two beaters in and my shorts and I'm good to go the first time you put them on you're like this is not going to make it better if you ever have breathing problems whenever you've got like a good line of of air you're like don't with it you know like just let it go so you go here to just destroy all of the good stuff and then you take your first breath and you're like I didn't know the air could be so sweet the studs what's up man what up Council we need to do something about billionaires I am proposing that the city of Los Angeles banned billionaires from the beach what do you think is the biggest mistake content creators make today not being them basically getting taken over by the algorithm and then like talking about blue trees when they don't actually with blue trees right but they did it because they did one blue tree post and people brought that back right so it had to um and so you got a lot of likes and they're like maybe I'll start making more stuff on Blue trees but like then they go down that Alleyway for six months or a year and then they're like oh I'm like the blue tree Channel but like I don't even care about trees like that's not the stuff I like talking about and so they can't actually sustain it because the biggest brands are built over decades not days or weeks or months a secret confession the majority of my news feed almost all of it is uh Comedians and that's because I like comedy and I think comedy and philosophy are probably my two great interests in terms of things that I consume because they are the two the two truth tellers of society it's philosophers and comedians I love what they do and I also think like what more philanthropic line of work can you have than to just bring joy to people I think that's really cool and I I have a lot of admiration for the craft and so I'd like to do more stuff in that Arena if the comedic world will happen as of this morning both 100 million dollar offers and 100 million dollar leads are on Amazon charts so top 20 books on all Amazon we have two of them yeah we beat Harry Potter take that JK I'm kidding you're amazing and I'm a huge fan of your work I'll say American chicken and rice is like man that's why you got to go off the sword gotta go Middle Eastern style some jujit Kebab if you know you know [Music] hello hello how are you bro good man you need to get back in the gym I know I cleaned out a little bit the challenge for you is going to be you continuing to grow and experience and dig deeper into not becoming a repetitive like everybody in the space yeah you know exactly what I mean because you are the best right now and you take on that title it took you a while you were like a rising dude coming up from like he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he's gonna do it now you've done it and by the way when I talk to other people this is kind of a consensus it's not like I'm giving you some compliment no one else has told you I think you're the best right now thanks man I say right now because that's not a title that you need to keep long term you have to keep arguing and fighting for it and scratching but you're the best right now you just spent two years of your life dedicated to this book you spent six hours every day writing it and so what now more better we will do more of what we were doing before we'll do it better I do have my project uh you have one of zero that I'm working on in the background at the same time I still have my third book and I think a lot of a lot of people are going to make a lot of money from it which I'm very excited about and we'll you know get more companies in acquisition.com but uh I have I have two big projects that I'm working on one is the third book uh the other is is one of zero and those are kind of the two big projects that I have for the next two years\n"
