  "transcript": "these people all got rich in the influencer revolution and in this video I'm going to break down exactly how they did it how I built my personal brand and how you can too and yes that's you my close friend Taylor Swift has built one of the top 20 net worths of self-made women and has one of the single strongest personal Brands as a woman in existence today and here are five things that I learned from what she's done in building her brand that I use for me the first thing that I learned from her longevity do you know how old she was when she made her first song 16 it was in 2006 Tim McGraw was the first song that she released these people have actually a very long time under their belts of how many years they put in to their personal brand 14 years ago news Force Harry buer met an aspiring country music singer from Hendersonville high school and so a lot of times we're measuring a two-year career against a 20-year career and everything compounds with time she gained more popularity in the last 12 months than she probably did in the first 19 years which sounds crazy but at the same time is also true and so that's what Taylor did for longevity but what did I do my first podcast was in July of 2017 six plus years that I've been making content now to be fair hers was at a larger scale and as I actually increased my scale so too did my branding awareness and reach follow you got to do the same thing in a lot of quantity for a very long time before it really starts to get going don't compare your first year to someone's 10th year the longer you do something the better you get at it also the longer you do something the more you have done because if I post once a week for a year versus once a week for 10 years it's talking about 520 videos versus 52 videos so I'm going to have all of the compounding of all those other videos that going to be bringing people to my world that whole time plus 520 reps of being good at that thing and just to give you some numbers around this my first year of posting videos on YouTube I gained a total of 88,000 sub subscribers the second year I gained over 600,000 subscribers and so far this year I've done over 1.1 million subscribers and so the more you do the better you get and to give you another extreme example because I mentioned my podcast earlier my first two years of podcasting I got to a total of 2,000 downloads a month and just fast forward to now 6 years in I get about 2 million downloads a month so these things can compound they just take time the second thing that I learned is SC in the unscalable so she has famously been known for appearing randomly at some of her fans weddings to play songs for them everyone loses their mind all the iPhones come out and then she goes viral on the internet for a few days a newly wet couple got a surprise Wedding Crasher that they wouldn't dare to turn away I am not a worldclass performer and I'm probably not going to be able to perform at someone's wedding but how can I take what Taylor did in scaling the unscalable in that micro example and apply to what I do every so often I'll do a sporadic Q&A live with people in our audience in mosy nation what do I do for a living I invest in advised businesses so what's a micro version of that I can invest invise somebody who would never really have access to me in any other capacity and so I can still take that and then multiply to thousands of other people because it scale something that otherwise is unscalable I couldn't talk one-onone to every single person in my audience it' be impossible she can't show up at every person's wedding but she can still simulate the experience and to the same degree for me the reason I put out all this free content and I put out all my books and my Audi books and the courses and they're all free and I do that because that's something that allows me to take a lot of energy put it into one thing and then distribute it to everyone the third thing that I love from Taylor vulnerability even in her songs themselves she showcases her heart and her looking like the fool or the crazy person more times than not and so it Happ happens is she becomes still despite being the superstar that she is relatable at the lowest level to the girl that's still singing in her hairbrush into the mirror because they experience the same feelings Taylor does the many flaws and pitfalls and heartbreaks that she's had over her entire career and just showing them to the public rather than trying to hide them Taylor then instead of having something that everyone can attack flips it into a power because if you attack her for that you attack her entire fan base for experiencing the same thing and so she builds an army of people that will defend her because they resonate with the experience that she shared Taylor Swift fans may have taken her hit song Shake It Off too literally yeah it actually caused the equivalent of a 2.3 magnitude earthquake and it lasted several hours that's a new record okay Alex how are you vulnerable all the stories I tell the vast majority of them are me up and losing all my money twice she talks about relationships and love a lot and so her equivalent of bankruptcy and losing everything is is getting her heartbroken and so for me I talk about the first time I whiffed on a sale the first time I trusted a partner didn't work the first time I had all my money stolen the second time I had my money stolen the multiple businesses that I had to shut down when I had nine businesses and had to shut eight of them down so that I could go all in on one these are all stories that aren't like the fun cover of Forbes instead they're just like hey I also was a small business owner and made a lot of mistakes that you might too and so for another small business owner who hears that they might be like I've been there too and then it takes something that seems crazy and unattainable like a multi million doll portfolio and makes it relatable thing number four from Tay Tay I'm just going to put ownership so one of the things that Taylor has done differently than many musicians is that she's a shrewd businesswoman it's also why she's top 20 on Forbes for wealthiest women in general which she doesn't talk about as much but girl knows how to make money her last a Tour gross over a billion dollars on one tour so what she's done is she independently publishes her stuff and this has been something I think she's worked towards because in the beginning she sold our music and she had to buy it back lots of drama but she has moved towards this action and because now she has more money and she has more leverage because she has such a big audience she can negotiate different deals that other people wouldn't be able to and it's like okay Alex well how do I do something like that or how did you do something like that right off the bat I could have gone to a regular publisher to publish all my books like that would have been pretty much the normal path for the business influencer who wants to get the New York Times best seller whatever and so for me I give away chapter left and right I make it free on my podcast no Publishers like wait I want to buy the rights to your book so that you can only give it away for free but I want to do that and so in order to maintain control I maintained ownership over my stuff because even in the short term I could have taken a few million dollar check from a publisher just up front to write the book but I'd so much rather own it for the rest of my life and be able to give it away as I see fit because I know at least for me conditions change and me trying to make a decision today for something that I'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life feels steep even though it probably hurts more in the short term which is why so many musicians and creators do sign away all their rights too early because the people who have been there before have seen a hundred other creators go through it and they know it's going to happen but if you can have the stomach to be patient and actually believe that you're going to go all the way then it never makes sense to sell and so the last one that I learned from Taylor was shifting identity now a different way of saying this is that her brand has shifted over time yet she's gone from a country music player to the girl who chases boys and gets her heartbroken to then just becoming this powerful woman today and so she's shed her identity multiple times and transformed her brand multiple times into what it is today and I would say that the Aeros tour for example is a great exemplify of her leaning into this idea that she has set eras in her life today I didn't wear a nose strip what does that mean it just means I didn't wear a nose STP today and that's okay I don't actually have my hat on today either why am I doing that does it mean that I'm making some big statement about it no I just want to be me and if I ever feel like I have to dress the part to be on camera I don't want any part of it play it out if I then become beloved for something that I'm forcing myself into then what I'm doing is I'm portraying something that's other than myself for people to fall in love with as I change and grow I will grow further and further away from the thing that people love which means that I will have to feel more and more like a fraud I will have to fake it and pretend more and more as more people fall in love with this Idol that I've created that's not even real and so for me if I decide to change my shoes one day I'm going to change my shoes I'm not going to say well my whole audience expects me to wear Crocs I don't wear Crocs by the way anymore I think this is one of the beautiful things that creators have and that us as individuals have it's embracing who you are which I think she's done unbelievably well and staying true to that North Star rather than what critics want her to be and she's even changed that way in her music and she's like you know what I'm just going to be me that's what her audience is in love with her being her because she gives them permission to be themselves and if you're curious you belong with me is my favorite talor Swift song This Is The Rock This is a life-size cutout of him yes I am huge but not as huge as the Rocks net worth which just cross multiple billions of dollars based on his stake in teram Tequila here are four things I learned from from The Rock first thing right off the bat is the same thing that I got from Tay which is longevity do you know how long the rock has been the rock I mean we even call him the rock but he's Dwayne Johnson and some people don't even know that he got his career started as a WWE wrestler he started his career in 1996 some of you guys watching this weren't even a glimmer in your father's eye in 1996 so Point number one is longevity Point number two is work ethic one of the things that Dwayne Johnson has made himself famous for for is how early he shows up to sets how late he will stay and how he never misses a workout no matter what he's he flies into China it's 4 in the morning he's lifting weights like what the when he started his career he started at the bottom of the totem hole in WWE the guy that everyone beat up and he had to show up and work twice as hard the same story as Kobe Bryant of like if they work out once if I work out three times I'll just get better faster he wasn't born this way and even 5 years into that career he wasn't Dwayne Johnson The multi-billionaire icon he wasn't even still can you smell what The Rock is cooking yet [Applause] like but the Rock is cooking he hadn't really even reached the the peak or the Zenith of his startom it took a long time for him to get there and he was able to stomach it because of his work ethic and so how do I apply this to me I have always taken the position that I work from the moment I wake up until the moment I literally can't work anymore especially on the come up and so work from 4:00 a.m. until 10: and then from 10:00 a.m. on I would do my actual work with other people and so I couldn't get the work I wanted to get done done during the day cuz I had to run the business and so I would do it before everyone else was up you have to work double time you got to work the job that you have today but in the mornings or the late evenings you build for the job you want to have tomorrow when I say job I have a job too today even though I own the businesses that we're a part of I still have a job to do and so that job is doing what you have to do today and building for what you want to have tomorrow even my current season I spend 6 hours a day every day writing so that I can publish books on a regular Cadence and so my last book $ million leads I spent 6 hours a day for almost two years writing that book and same thing for offers and now with XYZ secret book that's coming out I'm doing the same thing the first thing every day before I came in today here to film this with you I edited my book for the first four hours of the day so the third thing I learned from the rock is expanding niches he became one of the most if not the most famous WD wrestler of all time now he could have stopped there but he had bigger aspirations and so over his career he has continued to widen and bro in what he's Associated himself with right in the very very beginning he was a football player then he spun that into the wrestling career and then he took that to the Natural maximum and then from there he started making movies but what did he start with he started with roles that required him to be in really good shape and show off that he was in it if you remember his first two movies the money returns and the later Scorpion King where he was actually a main character in that one he was there pretty much to show off his physique no one else in Hollywood is doing that not Tom Cruz not Will Smith now he's in Disney movies so he's gone from being a really high level football player to being bottom of the totem WWE to top of WWE to low low in the movie scene to high in the movie scene as an action career to the broadest base that you can have because when you get into Disney movies at that point you're catering to everyone following the strategy has made him among and if not the highest paid actor today and so for me you're like okay well how did you expand your Niche well I started as just a dude who was in shape and then people started com in and be like hey can you help me get in shape and I was like sure I guess and then somebody literally handed me money without me asking and I was like oh wow I guess I could make money doing this so then I got into the business of helping getting people in shape and then I was like maybe I could open a gym so then I opened a gym and then I started doing well with the gym and then people who own gyms were like hey can you help me run my gym and I was like I guess so I don't know if this is business and then again literally someone handed me ,000 and said launch my gym and I said I guess so and then I took that to 5,000 locations and then from there it was like hey how did you expand this BWB licensing thing so you went National businesses of that size started to approach me and that has literally been my entire career do something really well people ask me about it and then I say okay well I'll show you how I did that and each of these transitions has actually been forced every single time someone literally handed me money and said can you do it and I was like I guess so and then that's how it started so on the topic of money the fourth thing I've learned from The Rock monetization so The Rock has spent the first 20 plus years of his career not really monetizing his direct brand now he was in movies he obviously gets paid to do that he was paid to be in the WWE but he didn't really own anything that he was able to really push and then all of a sudden in the last three or four years he came out with zoa which is the energy drink and supplement line he came out with project rock with Under Armour which was a collaboration between him and them and he came out with teramana the tequila and his slice of teramana I believe is 30% stake in the company which is now valued over $6 billion he's been very strategic about the highest leverage ways that he can monetize his brand without deluding who he is we've all seen those actresses who come out with an alcohol line now and they don't even drink or they come out with makeup and they actually are known for their natural look things that just obviously don't make sense now what do people fall in love with a rock for they love the fact that he works super hard but he also has cheat days on Sunday he also sips his tequila and was doing that for a very regular basis and people knew he loved tequila and so it made sense for him because it wasn't a change it was just reinforcing more of what he already was and so if you think about how you want to monetize you want it to be more of what you already are and this is where people miss the mark they're like what's the thing that I can sell to the most people or what's the thing that's got the highest ticket it has to reinforce the association that people have come to love about you and so in studying The Rock and setting some of these other influencers what I'm paying a lot of attention to is how they're choosing to monetize Tastefully how do I monetize Tastefully well I own companies and so when companies consume my stuff and learn and grow and make more money then they hit me up and say hey Alex can you help me grow and scale my company and invest and I say sure if they're awesome and if they're not I just say just enjoy all the other stuff I don't need 25 Facebooks I just need one and so I'm okay with the fact that 99.9% of people will only quote take for me and not give anything back and I'm cool with that it's the same reason it would be weird if I came out with a luxury watch line or a suit line of three-piece suits that would be completely off brand now do a lot of my people in my audience probably wear suits and do business yes would that be a high ticket item I could probably make a lot of money on yes does it make sense for my brand no and so that's the idea is that we have these associations that people have come to love you for and then to go counter that just to make money everyone sees it and then they lose trust with you you can file bankruptcy when you go way too far into debt and then you can start over but you can't file bankruptcy on a reputation once it's ruined it's ruined for life and it takes a very long time to build one and a very short time to lose one and so if you ever have the choice between reputation and money always choose reputation because this one you can't get back you can always make more money all right the rock now we're going to Mr Beast so first things first that I learned from uh Mr Beast was his longevity and you're going to hear me keep repeating this and the reason I say it is because everyone keeps comparing themselves to someone's 10th year starting was what 13 what's up guys OV excited generic YouTuber here he's 11 years in of doing this at an obsessive rate I feel like there's there's two stages in most people's career there's the time they start and the time they get serious he happened to do both on the same time and so if you can decrease the time between when you start and when you commit you'll start seeing the benefits of commitment sooner like I see so many people who got into fitness and they say I've been training for 5 years and I say have you been training for 5 years or do you have you been going to the gym on and off for 5 years and they're like well I've been training for 6 months I've been going on and off for four and a half years and I'm like well then the first four and a half years was literally just to prepare you for the first 6 months of taking this seriously you're only 6 months into your working out career not 5 years and so they then compare themselves to somebody 5 years to be like why am I not there it's like you're really only 6 months in Go Pro be a professional and take it like your job number two and this is a big one this is super tactical so I was having a conversation with Mr Beast and I was like we're not trying to make you know clickbait videos we going to make stuff that people feel is you know really high quality Etc and he looked at me and he just looked at like I had four heads and he was like you absolutely make clickbait videos he's like you just need to make the clickbait true and it was such a great mindset shift for me because when I think about marketing I think about the same way if you want to Market a product make the crazy claim but back up the crazy claim and some of you guys have been commenting that we've kind of upped our game on our videos and a lot of it comes from this Frame of Mind of like how can you make an insane claim and back it up with an even more insane video number three is doubling down the day he started was the day he went pro he said he was either going to become a pro YouTuber or he wasn't going to do anything at all and he has shown that with his actions as he makes more money he puts all of it back into the next videos and he has consistently done that since day one and if anything his current Channel still runs as a quote nonprofit in that it's not profitable because he actually chooses to monetize elsewhere through febles and Beast burger and some of his other Ventures he has continued to reinvest in his compounding vehicle and you'll notice compounding is a common theme among all these people that we're talking about is that he took the extra rather than putting his pocket he said what if I put it back on black again and it is very much a gamble but if you know what you're doing you become the house so for me personally I have been willing to double down on my career and make big bets that otherwise didn't make sense my first career as a consultant most people said oh you should go do more of that but I took all my learnings from being a consultant and then started a gym which was a a big bet for me but I was doubling down on what I beli to be true then I scaled my gyms to six locations and then I just basically walked away from them I fire sold them in 90 days and then started the licensing business and from there doubled down there until now we now have acquisition. comom our portfolio of companies even when I was thinking about selling gym launch so many people are like dude you have this amazing business that you don't have to do anything for that prints you out millions of dollars a month in personal income what is wrong with you why would you sell because the thing is is that they will project their goals onto your reality and as long as your reality is above their goals they will not understand you and so if you have big goals then you only have to listen to you because whatever yours is if you satisfied their check mark it's like I satisfied you not me and so being willing to double down and burn the boats and pursue the dream that you actually want is risky but in my opinion when I die and I look back well when I die I won't be able to look back but right before I die and I look back I will be so much more proud of the failures that I risked than the successes that I didn't and the fourth thing that I learned from Mr Beast was packaging specifically around media I watched Sam take apart someone else's video and in the first 5 seconds he said stop the video and this is somebody who had already had 10 million views on the video and was upset that they didn't have 30 million views and he said oh you didn't match the thumbnail to the first 5 Seconds you didn't confirm it he was like well that's it he's like I don't need to watch any more of the video that's why it's not a 30 million view video and it was such a tiny tactical detail but it made such a massive difference in the amount of views I now appreciate how important how you package the content you have so for example some of you guys have noticed that we run split tests on the thumbnails and the reason for that is that there's two things we look at one is how many people click but then how long people who click based on that watch and you'd be amazed that there's sometimes 20 30% increases in the amount of time that someone will watch simply based on how the video was framed and so for us we want to make real business education accessible for everyone and making it accessible for everyone means that we have to package it in a way that makes it attractive to everyone and fulfills the promises that we made in the packaging I made a video a long time ago about luxury goods now the whole video is just about understanding how luxury goods fits within a pricing Matrix in a marketpl sounds kind of boring but I was like huh how can I package this in a way that would make it more accessible for more people and recently Bernard or know who owns lvmh Which is a holding company that owns many many luxury brands that you've heard of flash them on the screen he had just recently become the richest man and so I was like oh this is relevant how did he become the richest man through luxury goods and just doing that dramatically improved how many people would benefit from the video because it became timely it became trending and he was around someone who already demonstrated that he was a viable business model and the last one I want to hit on from Jim is resourcefulness now a lot of people see him today as the person who spends a million dollars on every video and he's giving all this money away and they're like I could never copy Jimmy and you're right you can't today but what you can copy is the things that he did to get here and so his first ever viral video was him counting up as high as he could and I think he got to 100,000 plus now how much did that cost nothing just imagination and as soon as he made $110,000 from that video he gave it to a homeless guy this is not clickbait I'm going to give a random homeless guy $10,000 today and then that video went viral he's consistently just said how can I use what I have which if you follow any of my content the first rule of entrepreneur ship is use what you've got and he has exemplified that in his content and so how do you relate this to me well when I started I didn't have the big media team that I have today it was just me and a webcam and then from there we're like okay let's get one with just like some lights in a professional camera and then it was like okay I'm actually going to have a videographer here present with me when I do these videos and then it was like you know what we might actually edit the videos rather than just trimming out the front and the end and the ums it didn't make sense for me at the beginning to have a massive media team because I didn't know what I was doing and so as we've gotten better we've gotten better and we've used the resources we have to continue to grow the team so we can make more stuff for you guys I would recommend not beating yourself up for the fact that you don't have resources but learning the skill of resourcefulness which you will need throughout the entirety of your career because at every level you have to always be resourceful and if you don't learn how to be resourceful when you have nothing you're not going to be resourceful when you have everything thanks Jim appreciate that and the chocolate bars check out febles by the way right off the bat what did I learn from Joe longevity you're like wow Alex why do you keep saying that because it  matters all right I keep repeating it because not one of these people is an overnight success all these are decade plus successes and most of them are multi- deade successes Joe started doing stand-up comedy in Boston in 1988 and for many of my audience you also weren't alive then on top of that he got his first real break when he started doing Fear Factor which is a show where he's basically mcing girls getting rats thrown into a tub with them where they have to keep their mouth open Joe's had the humility throughout his entire career to be willing to do whatever it took and I don't think when he was a little kid was like I want to be a star he was like I'm going to go MC girls in bikinis uh having bees all around them dripping with honey I don't think he thought that but he was willing to take the opportunities to presented itself and he's been willing to stick with it for a very very long time second thing I've learned from Joe you know what I think this is important enough that I'm I'm going to put it on here because he has restarted his career at zero multiple times like he was a standup comedian but then he's doing mcing for a TV show he probably wasn't as good as he is now when he does it for the UFC one of the biggest sports in the world he was willing to be humble and do it and suck and that's why so many losers lose is because they're not willing to lose they cannot accept sucking and so they always lose by default because they never start yeah until you win no one pays attention to you get used to it and the reason people look like overnight successes is because you just happen to find out about them when they hit it and so you just Mark the fact that when you find out about them is when they started doing it which is ridiculous but it's a cognitive bias just because you experience the world that way doesn't mean it's true so for me I have basically restarted my career multiple times probably the biggest slice of humble pie that I've had to eat was going from being a white collar consultant on my way to Harvard to being a personal trainer at a local gym so not even an owner or a manager a Frontline trainer getting paid minimum wage and so when you go from a sixf fig job to a minimum wage job your status changes a lot and that was tough for me but I knew how miserable I was doing the thing that I didn't like and I believed that this wasn't what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life and I knew that for me this was a season of learning not earning and so I never thought I was going to be stuck at minimum wage I just knew that I felt like I was just getting paid to learn so I was like I would pay to be here so the fact that they're paying me is just a great deal for me because the thing is is you compare yourself today at Day Zero whereas what I left I was probably at year six in terms of like all the things I did to get there I had to prep for SATs to get into Vanderbilt to graduate in three years to have be president and vice president of the The Power Team president of the fraternity and then do all the case study stuff so I could get the consulting job and did that for two years and then prep for the gats like I was six years into that career but I started over at zero because I just wanted something else and all of you guys who are watching this right now you're watching this personal brand being built and all this content that they putting out I just learned this stuff like 2 or 3 years ago right now I started making my podcast six years ago but for three years I didn't do anything else besides my podcast but I didn't really go pro on making content until the end of 2019 2020 I didn't know anything and so I hired people and was like hey can you tell me they're like you suck and I'm like yeah I'm aware of that and I told the first guy that I heard for YouTube I said I'm willing to do this for 10 years and I was like if it doesn't work after 10 years I was like I'll stop and when we obviously took it in house he said on the way out he was like I just want you to know that you changed my entire perspective because I've never had a single person tell me that they were willing to wait a decade for something to work he's like every other person who comes to me is like how do I get 100K subscribers 90 days and it's unsurprising now that we actually probably have a bigger subscriber base than anybody he'd ever worked with because we approached it differently I'm just willing to suck because I believe that if someone else can get good at it so can I number three this is probably probably the most important one you are the niche I want to be really clear there's a difference between having a personal brand and building a brand in a business building a brand in a business is going to be around the products you sell and the Avatar or the audience that you Market to so if you want to build content for a specific business that sells widgets then it should be probably people using that widget within the context they would use it in but you building a personal brand should be true to the person just like you're being true to the product and be Encompass all the things that you really are what is Joe Rogan's Niche is it politics but then he does all this biohacking stuff okay was it Fitness well then he talks about aliens like a lot okay well is it fighting cuz he's really deep into fighting but he's also a big time standup comedian well shoot what is it it's none of them and it's all of them it's Joe Rogan because if I said all of those things together hey what big celebrity do you know who's into biohacking aliens politics technology fighting and comedy you'd be like Joe Rogan because that's his unique thumbprint now all of those are different categories and in different proportions so for example he's got health and he's got comedy well on his show which of them takes up a greater percentage well he probably talks more about biohacking and health and things that are going on in the in the total us around Health compared to Comedy now he still has comedians on his show and talks about comedy stuff but the proportion is different so not only is it the number of categories but it's the proportion between the categories that makes the unique thumbprint of the creator point being if you're building a personal brand speak to things that you know and if you're like well I don't know very much you start with the one you know cuz you've lived your life up to this point and you spent time one way or another which means that there are things that are unique to you that you are deeper on than somebody on the street and one of the hardest parts about this and this is me just being real with you is that if you know it really well you actually assume everyone does if you were raised around cars for example and your dad was a mechanic or you just like love that stuff you probably know a lot more about cars than the average person I don't know anything about cars I'm not really that interested in but there are people who are and so you making content about the things that you actually care about you will be knowledgeable and there's a difference between telling people what they should do and sharing the things that you know it's subtle but one is preaching one is teaching and you want to be the teacher not the preacher I think one of the things that he has given me permission to do is talk about all the things that I am interested in cuz I spoke to many people and they're like dude don't talk about your like death phosy stuff it's like really dark and they're like just just talk about money stuff but if you're going to be talking money stuff you should wear a suit because you want to look that part but I don't I don't dress that way I dress like this but they're you're going to look like a meathead so then which of these things is Alex rosi all of them none of them at the same time your brand will be stronger based on how closely it matches who you really are and the things that you genuinely care about and as those things change so too should your brand to reflect that rather than say oh I had a mustache for 5 years which by the way I did I had a big Gunslinger mustache for 5 years and everything that was public had a gunslinger mustache and then I was like you know what kind of want to do a beard so I put a beard on and so what happened to my brand it changed but that was okay because that's who I was then and this is who I am now and maybe in the future I'll shave one day and you know what I'll still be me and so if you want to measure the strength of a single person in your audience in relation to your brand it's how many interest that you have that a person in your audience shares or overlaps with if I like politics and fighting and comedy and health and Aliens I'm probably going to love Joe Rogan on the flip side if I don't like any of those things but I kind of like Health then I might kind of like Joe Rogan because I don't like the majority of the other stuff he talks about and so taking this into my personal context if someone likes training calvs they like desserts they like being in shape they like business in making money they like philosophy they're probably going to like my stuff and some of the business people are like dude I wish you could just only make business content I was like but that's not me cuz I don't only talk about business but the point is is that like I don't want to shy away from who I am so that I can meet some artificially generated algorithm character that doesn't really exist and I think that in the short term if I did that I probably would win in the short term but in the long term I would resent who that character become because they had been become so far away for who I really am and then I would feel like a fraud and then you would see it in my content because I wouldn't feel legit number four is that Joe only talks about sponsorships he believes in now he obviously is equity in some of the companies that he promotes though he had a big exit with on it uh which is a multi million do supplement brand that he basically pioneered and Alpha Brain the product that he talked about a lot when we came up with alpab brain it was the first one that I ever tried that I was like this is like a very clear difference but he's in a position where he could get oh my God if if FTX wanted him to to promote their products I'm sure they did he could have made a massive check from them for promoting it but he didn't believe in it so he said no and so a lot of what he's defined himself by is all the things that he only truly wants to win so he only promotes stuff that he actually wants to win and he believes in and you can hear it in the endorsements that he gives he's like I use this stuff and so I'm letting you know about it I take uh a a a giant athletic greens every day and doesn't come across salesy he just lets you know why he takes it and so in my opinion the thing that I've learned from Joe is that you want to promote things that are minimal changes in your behavior so ideally you exist exactly the way you were before except you just happen to get paid for something that you would already be willing to tell someone about now that massively limits the amount of things that you can promote but that's okay because you don't want to be these people who just shill 100 things because by doing that you also dilute the brand that you have because everyone knows it's not you because no one's interested in 100 things you might only be interested in 2 3 4 maybe five things and that's probably what you should limit your quote brand bullets to and the fifth one is no hacks all right this is so so big because you can think about Joe is almost the anti- algorithm it just says episode whatever and the name of the guest and he doesn't cut all the stuff so he can make it the most action- pack scene he just lets it cut unedited raw and uploads it his Instagram he says he subscribed to post and ghost which is he posts it and then he ghosts it they're not optimized he just uses the platform as somebody who uses the platform and people choose to follow him because they are interested in what he is interested in so he is interesting because he is interested if you look at every one of these celebrities if you look at their social media it doesn't look like they're influencers but they have more followers than almost all the influencers put together that are what I would consider the hacky and influencers always trying to like algorithm hop or Trend hop you don't see Rogan hopping on the Taylor Swift trend for his Instagram he just is Joe I get approached by so many people who DM me saying hey man I don't think your LinkedIn is optimized hey I don't think your your Instagram is optimized for growth hey I can do a shout out for shout out let's do a giveaway to do 20,000 followers 50,000 followers whatever it is none of those build brand they are simply trying to exploit an artificial hole or inefficiency in how an algorithm works and if you base your brand on algorithm exploitation you're basing it on a flaw in a system that will get fixed and so what you want to do in my opinion is that you want to align what you make with what the platform wants rather than what the platform doesn't want and you hacking around it what the platform wants is for you to make engaging content that an audience finds interesting so they stay on the platform that's it and so the best way to make interesting content is to talk about the things you are interested in if if you post things that are real for you you will be real for your audience rather than just some that surfed on their Newsfeed that they can immediately go to your feed and see that all you do is Trend hop which means that you actually don't exist at all Kylie was actually the last in the armor for me deciding to start making content and the reason for that was she got the cover of Forbes as a quote billionaire at age 20 and I saw that and at the time I thought I was hot  for being a multi-millionaire and when I saw her do that I have a fundamental belief about business that if someone makes more money than me they are better at the game of business in some way than I am and that I can learn from them and the big difference between what Kylie was doing and what I was doing was her brand and she had built that through content the first lesson that I'll say that I have learned from klie was yet again longevity because yes she has a billion dollar brand and she's very young but guess how young she started being on National television she appeared on National Television for the first time 20 years ago on Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a little bitty itty bitty gy girl yeah yeah yeah going she's been in the game two decades and so as much as she is young she still has put time under the bar and if you see a common theme for all these people even the youngest people here have at least a decade and often multiple decades under their belts so staying with it for a long term yet again rules the day number two is that she showed me Leverage now leverage in multiple ways number one is that she is leveraged from her family she hangs out with other people who are famous one of the easiest ways to get more exposure is to hang out with people who already have exposure and she did that early on and has done that throughout her career number one number two is that she uses media she record something one time and millions and millions of people can see it and so by using that she gets more for what she puts in and so that's being able to accelerate her career number three is that based on the actual products that she has chosen to sell with her brand she does does things that scale and so imagine if she was selling a tax service it'd be very difficult for her to scale that to her audience but if she sells a lip kit she can make a gazillion of those the only real constraint on that would be capital and she's got that and so she was able to get a high leverage brand with a huge audience that she built with a long time and media and funnel it into something that has a lot of Leverage that she built one time and then could print over and over and over again to her entire audience just simply the business she chose to select was one that better suited a mass Market B Toc brand a lot of creators make the wrong mistake here I see guys starting a restaurant when they have a national brand not to say that you won't make money it's just that you won't make as much money as you otherwise could in a better vehicle number three is that she outsources her weaknesses so the things that she is in charge of is the product and the marketing so she cares a lot about the lip kits and she cares a lot about the messaging and how things appear and how she disseminates and promotes it but everything else that she's not an expert at she's probably not an expert at third party Logistics she's probably not an expert at actually manufacturing stuff she's probably not an expert at running warehouses she's probably not an expert at even building websites but based on the brand that she has and the success of the company she has we could probably make a leap of faith to say that she's pretty good at product and she's also pretty good promoting and so by doing the things that she's good at she's been willing to give up some of the pie to other people who have that expertise so she can leverage the fact that somebody else has years in third party Logistics partners with them and to be fair this is something you see across the Kardashians they do very well is that they don't try and own the entirety of the pie they say how can we all win here and I'll take this from the late Charlie Munger I don't need every last dollar because he believed that it's either a good deal or it isn't and if it's a great deal I'm going to make a ton of money and if it's not he doesn't need to Chisel away percentage points and I think I've seen that across all of the Kardashians and how they structure their deals they're willing to let other people in to leverage 20 years of experience to not have to start over at Ground Zero they start at year 20 on someone else's career because of all the learnings and connections that person has so that they can just jump that much further forward because I don't know about you but I'd rather own 20% of a 20 billion company than 100% of a million dollar company and number four is that she Embraces controversy they have time and again leaned into what other people deem as controversial and ridden the wave of attention that it brings with it Kylie and her entire family has been willing to do that now that being said I wouldn't say that I've completely embraced this one entirely because I don't really talk about much controversial stuff besides poor people should stop doing poor people stuff they start following what rich people do and do more rich people stuff but besides that not a lot of controversy and so maybe I need to do better there but these are things that I think have helped build and Propel her brand at a faster rate than other people the next one is that she's adaptable but she's been able to adapt as media platforms have changed and so it was television once and then they went from television to Hulu which is online TV they went all in on Instagram really really early and started making content there on a regular basis and their content looks very different from the classic influencers their content feeds into their brand as super famous people and they continue to reinforce that with the luxury Brands they've all done deals with and the products they promote themselves and the next one is that she is accessible and this may be even her superpower and this is partially because she's in the makeup industry she leaned into just being who she was and so she would do Instagram lives and stories where it was just her no makeup despite what the media May portray them as is making false and unrealistic expectations for girls I think that what they actually make in their content is probably the exact opposite of that they show the 16 hours that it took them to get ready for the Met Gala and all of these things that they do where they have to paint the stuff onto them or they have to not be able to go to the bathroom for 3 hours because of the stuff that they're wearing they show that stuff so that they become more accessible so that people who relate to that also want to buy their their products and so you might see all these things and be like how did you use this Alex one I started posting content in general because I saw how much she had made and I was like I am missing this whole concept of brand and started leaning into it number two is that I would say that leverage literally is part of our logo and it's one of the things that I talk about all the time it's something that I believe a lot in Outsourcing weaknesses that's why you hire great people every single time I built one of these channels out I don't try and learn a new platform I find somebody already knows it and I pay them to teach me so that I can learn faster I'm not good at embracing controversy but but in terms of adaptability and accessibility we have continued to go into new platforms as fast as we can and as fast as they come out so that we can experiment and we're willing to have stuff that absolutely flops and I think that's cool because we learn and finally the accessibility piece is even though in the beginning it was a webcam and it was just me in a closet making videos I'd rather start with what I have than try and portray the life that I have cuz I went from being really rich and Anonymous saying you know what maybe I'll make some videos to making lots of stuff and making it look really polished and highly produced but it didn't happen overnight and I think that mosy nation has appreciated just watching the journey the whole way through just as they've probably appreciated watching her journey even though they know that she could put filters on or could only hop on Instagram live once she's done all of her makeup like I could probably Flex more of my material belongings than I do uh because I just don't think that would serve anyone and so that's why I don't so I've learned that from them now obviously she flexes a little bit on her material belong but you know tomato tomato everyone's got different brands I'm not going to come out with a lip kit anytime soon so that's her brand not mine so my brand has evolved over the ages you can call this mosy through time and this is me as 23 years old really into fitness and just starting my first gym here I'm much older as somebody who's the master gym licenser you know I have 5,000 Plus locations I'm building gym launch which is a company that's B2B servicing gym owners and then over here you've got mosy today who is the managing partner of a private Equity Firm called acquisition. comom that owns a bunch of companies and so the question is how does a brand as a personal brand evolve over time in the beginning look how I dressed I've got my neon tank top and I've got my neon shorts and the reason that I dress this way is because one this is how I actually dressed cuz I was into fitness but also I had a 70% female audience I needed to look approachable not like a big scary dude me today probably not something that most women are going to be like yes I'm going to trust him in my weight loss Journey they're like I don't want to look like you and you have a beard no thank you right but this looks like a relatively approachable young man who's high energy and filled with the Light Of Hope all I was focused on was Fitness Nutrition and accountability I was listening to Rihanna on Tuesdays that I was cranking inside of the gym and I had women's only playlist and I was catering to the audience that I had at that time and me in reality was this person all I was thinking about was Fitness and anyways and really just trying to get my career going as an entrepreneur now fast forward here when I'm the master licenser if I was this guy the audience that I have here is 90% male and not only 90% male 90% jacked male gym owners so look how my personal brand changed now I want to be clear it's not like every time I did this it was the most deliberate thing it was just that I also changed over time because what happened is here all I was thinking about was Fitness I had just been competing I had a few State records I was following periodization I was counting my macros every day it was what I was obsessed with at the time which is why I started a business around Fitness but that second part a business around Fitness started to become the most important part to me which is why over time I started caring more and more about business and less and less about Fitness and so then I became the gym Lord which was the name of our community which is gym Lords and so I started wearing the stuff that repped my new company and most most the people that followed my stuff then believe it or not I was a lot cruder about making money back then than I am now because remember this was the guy who wanted to be rich and Anonymous you will probably grow and change in your interests and the way you dress and the way you look also changed that way now I think there's a biral relationship I changed and so so did my audience which also changed me back my pants are falling down I have to blur that out so I'll call out two things that were very specific about this number one was that I called it originally gym rescue and as soon as I got on the phone with people people were like I don't be rescued I don't need to be rescued and then their egos would flare up so I was like oh no what if we just launch your gym like we're doing a grand opening and they're like okay yeah yeah that's cool even though they've been open for 5 years but when I called it a launch everyone was fine with it so then I switched my language from gym rescue to gym launch because of my audience not because of what I wanted kind of interesting the second thing is you'll notied that I went from brigh eyed and bushy tailed kid here to man with a handlebar mustache and so then the mustache became part of the brand and I did that for the entire of time that I was the gym Lord and running gym launch so then what happened is as I started making more and more money I started seeing people making even more money than me and it was all these private Equity guys and I was like this guy bought a company for 50 million sold it for 250 made 200 million didn't even have to start the company and so as my interest started to evolve because I started investing more and I started buying real estate I started buying businesses and I was like huh there's a game beyond the game and I actually started moving away from being the gym Lord because I didn't want to be the face of that company more I just wanted to be the owner and so this shift was me going from operator to owner and as an owner all I cared about was my return on investment and making sure that we were doing business in alignment with our values and so I started dressing how I would dress without being public facing now the irony of this whole thing is that in dressing in a way that wasn't supposed to be public facing I ended up becoming even more public facing than I ever thought and so over time the way that I dress which is pretty much just the most utilitarian way I can imagine look at these caps and so this is mosy today and there may be a mosy in the future who dresses differently because I changed my mind about stuff but the thing is is that over the years I went from loving Fitness to loving operating businesses to loving owning and scaling companies and my progression as an individual has reflected in how I dressed and who I was talking to but the point is is that I think the only way to make a personal brand last is for it to be you and I want to be really clear here this is a visual prop set and I'm using this because people need visuals to understand stuff but I will say that I feel like this overemphasizes the importance of a quote outfit it is not that important if I start wearing black tank tops tomorrow and I start wearing sweats no one's going to give a because my value is about the stuff that I provide that helps the audience do better helps hopefully you guys make more money grow in the ways that you want to grow achieve the goals you want that's the value not how I dress it's just that because I dress this way and I do it consistently because that's who I am people have then Associated that value with this outfit which is why someone else can wear my logo and people will approach them and Associate the value that I've given them with that person and that's how you brand that's how you build brand equity and so I show this as a visual demonstration to give you the idea but not to emphasize that you have to wear a certain thing in order to build your brand but if what you wear is a representation of who you are then it will probably have some degree to that because people at least at the onset will judge you by how you look and just to give you guys some context on why a private Equity investor would be even be making a a YouTube video and be explaining this topic so number one is that notice how all these people are all billionaires kind of interesting why are they billionaires what's different now versus what it was before well now there's direct distribution when Tom Hanks became famous he didn't have direct distribution so he always had to do Partnerships with movie companies who then did Partnerships with movie theaters to distribute the content but now because platforms came in between the distribution and the end user creators could immediately post directly and interact with their entire audience and so what that did is it cut out all these middlemen and allowed creators to take up a huge slice of the economics and so me recognizing that in each of these people is part of the reason that I started even though I didn't need to start making content because I saw the value in the audience and just to give you guys some hard stats around this on why I decided to basically give up anonymity which I do like my privacy one is that this is according to Goldman Sachs the crater economy is projected to be at 500 billion half a trillion a year plus by 2027 this is not far away this is 1 b500 times in a row every year that's a that's a lot of billions and to give you an idea of the audience size Instagram has 2.3 billion and then YouTube has 2.6 billion users and Tik Tok has 1.6 billion these are all monthly active users I mean this is the world and then beyond that just to give you context in terms of just USA YouTube alone creates $25 billion a year in GDP for the United States of America just from jobs that were created by creators which right now is over 400,000 jobs this is real economics that are happening and unfolding in front of our eyes how business was traditionally done has been turned on its head and when you see teenagers and 20-year-olds becoming decamillionaires ctim Millionaires and billionaires pay attention because the troll comments in this world are like if you have so much money why are you making these videos dumbass if I have so much money why the do you think I'm making the videos because there's value in doing it beyond all of the obvious ones which is you build an audience you can sell things to them the larger one that's unspoken is the access to other people now if I want to reach out to a public CEO and say hey can I hop on the phone or hey do you want to do a podcast the answer is yes because I have an audience and so whatever their message is it doesn't matter how rich you are if you don't have someone listening you can't distribute your message so you might be sitting at home or at the gas station or between things or you're on the can right now thanks for joining me and wondering okay I just saw some of the biggest influencers of all time and how they built their brands what am I going to do now so what we're going to use as a process rip Charlie merer called inverted thinking so rather than say hey here's the six steps to creating your personal brand I want to talk about the things that would would destroy a personal brand or guarantee that you never build one to begin with so let's start off the top if I were to only do this one thing what would I do to guarantee that I can't build a brand well number one is I would talk about something that I know nothing about so if you talk about stuff that you don't know anything about and are not interested in I can guarantee you will not build a very good brand around that topic next I would be inconsistent and ideally not even start for fear of judgment so let's call that quitting slash start stop you can't stick with it because even if your stuff was really really good if you quit for a long time or you start and you stop and you start and you stop I can guarantee you you're not going to build a big brand next thing I would do is I would try and do two things around selling one is I would sell early so that means that I haven't provided any value to my audience and I immediately start trying to sell them stuff I have very little Goodwill I don't have a lot of people but because I'm desperate for money I start trying to sell stuff and I sell it really hard well that'll probably destroy the brand because people already have very little affin towards you and now they have zero so that would be one of the things I would definitely do to make sure that we destroy your brand the other thing is I would sell wrong and what I mean by that is that I'd sell the wrong stuff and so if I'm making stuff about gardening then I say hey you should take this credit card that has all these great Reward Points it doesn't really match now if I was a financial or investing influencer that might make sense but if I'm a gardening influencer just because they're the only person who reached out and said hey we'll give you 500 bucks to do the sponsorship some money is not worth taking but if we were to do that we would definitely decrease our audience and decrease the likelihood that they want to tune into our stuff in the future so the next thing I do is I was associate with the wrong crowd the wrong people people that their core values and the things that they're interested in directly conflict I'll give you a couple examples for me one is like a snake oil salesman so if somebody has a really crappy product or they make these false promises or false claims then me making association with them would hurt my brand and so the idea is if we wanted to make sure we'd hurt your brand we'd make sure to associate with the wrong people next is I would need perfect conditions don't start today start when you have perfect conditions because the thing is is that there are no perfect conditions and so you're like well I will only succeed if I have a really big set and lots of people helping me and a script and a teleprompter and all these special effects if you need that to win you're not going to win because what I can tell you about every person that we talked about earlier all of them started with what they had and so if you really think you're going to go all the way then be willing to work with what you have and the last one is I would never ever change because even if things did start working if we guaranteed that we didn't change then we can guarantee that eventually the conditions will change and we will fail because you're like but this thing started working I have to keep doing that and then you slowly see it stop working less and less and less and less and you don't change with it and at the same degree you change if your brand never changes at all you have changed and it means that there's actually greater and greater distance between who you are and who you represent yourself to be and that long term will sync you and so so if everything I just covered if you do these things you can guarantee that your brand will not win and will not succeed in the long term and so if we're being enterprising about this what if we flip it because that might just be the recipe to succeeding in the long term which means we talk about the stuff that we know and that we're interested in we stay consistent with it and we just start and we keep going you wait way too long to sell it all if you are going to sell to begin with because you want to make sure that you always provide so much more value than you ever ask from your audience and then if you do choose to sell something you sell something that actually requires you to change nothing about who you are if I already love this type of tank top and people know that I've been wearing it for a few years then it would make sense for me to say by the way this is the brand I use no one's going to be upset by that because it makes sense based on everything they've seen up to this point and I would associate with people who are like me who have audiences like mine who care about the things like I do so that those audiences combine and compound unto each other rather than duding all of the associations I spent so much time curating and putting together to say this is what I stand for and we would wait for in perfect conditions which often means today because there are no perfect conditions and finally being willing to embrace change because change is the only constant that will happen in braining at all is that the platforms will change the media will change the packaging will change and you yourself will change over this whole time and you have to be willing to do that or eventually you will die and so these are the steps if reversed that can create a brand in my opinion might be able to follow to get rich in today influence Revolution\n"
