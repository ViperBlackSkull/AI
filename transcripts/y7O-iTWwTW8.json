  "transcript": "if you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave would you tell him hey guys on this episode that for Moses I'm gonna be flying down to Nashville to record a full podcast with Dave Ramsey I'm going to be breaking down a viral clip we posted that went crazy everywhere we're gonna be doing a full workout together and we'll wrap it up with a photo shoot enjoy what flavor is that no idea you never know could be a secret there's no chocolate chips problem with white chocolate not for me travel interrupts my productivity more than Layla's for me like having my stuff and my setup I tend to be more effective when I'm at home and so it feels like a bigger cost for me so I try and do it as little as I can going out to see Dave was something that like I've always been a big fan of his stuff and so it made a ton of sense for me to take a day to fly out see him to everyone who doesn't fly private I will give you a little bit of insight and it's not always as cracked up as you might think because the Wi-Fi is slow as [Â __Â ] yeah we're cheap private jet Flyers we have limits I just like can't yeah faster and they just pay obscene amounts for the plane and like it's just like I don't want to pay triple the price just to have like a nice plane like for us the big thing speed that's what we like about it I'm still not loaded waste the [Â __Â ] time all right make some goddamn content what [Music] I want to hear about Solomon's Paradox yeah it's almost an ancient King in the Bible that he was considered one of the wisest men of all time it's his particular Paradox because he made lots of bad decisions repeatedly had uncontrolled passion for money and women and neglected to instruct his only son who went on to ruin his kingdom people give significantly better advice about their own scenarios if they don't know it's about themselves if you only just filed your own advice it'd be way better than you currently are a practice that I started doing which is I have a coaching session with myself weird I have a conversation with my future self who's 85 and I asked him for advice on what I should do now and so 85 year old me explains to me what I already know in my deep self but my emotional self that's you know running the ship forgets but instead of like meditating to myself I actually write it down actually like the judicism we'll wait for the Wi-Fi Solomon projects my line and then their line and then my line again as I'm going through it so it's like I'm like chatting but I'm filling out both sides of the chat but I'm putting different hats on that's like me talking to me like I deal with this [Â __Â ] too I talk about thinking long and being patient it's because every day I'm impatient it's fun I'm like why is this happening faster like this should have happened two quarters ago like the same things that you guys feel as entrepreneurs like I feel them too oh wow I don't know that's like I'm bigger like what can I control what can I not control I hope that there was going to be Wi-Fi and there wasn't good Wi-Fi I knew I was gonna basically have three hours of my life taken from me we ended up turning it into a recording session which ended up doing really well from the stuff that we recorded in that time period so it ended up being a net positive that I didn't have Wi-Fi if I had had Wi-Fi the Avante moment might not have ever been captured so you wanna hear about Avante Layla and I walk a lot and so we get stopped fairly frequently but this particular guy came up to me didn't say hi and immediately started telling me about his life and he didn't take a breath he was like shaking he's like dude he's like I'm just so sick of being poor man he's like I've got a one-year-old I'm working two jobs she's like so I just I don't know how to get ahead this is a video I'm making for Avante the young man who was working two jobs with a one-year-old who's struggling and said he was sick and tired of being poor and didn't know how to get out there are far more people who are struggling than there are people who are succeeding and so having content that speaks tactically to what to do when you're in that situation appeals to a much broader audience it wasn't surprising me that it got the response that it did but I'm happy that I think it served a lot more people than just Devonte all right where's the right button here it's like six buttons here someone definitely has hit that button I think a lot of people beat up on Dave because of his stances on debt I live a hundred percent debt free but also his argument succinctly put is that introduces risk risk when compounded over a lifetime is bound to come due if you plan on playing the game for a very long time you're betting on the fact that you're never gonna have a bad season and that's a hard bet to make have fun thanks wish me luck if your plan requires luck to succeed it's a bad plan people travel all over the country come here just say you know their debt-free that's what worked it out so I think you're going to be right here today's uh oh good that's my good side yeah this is usually my better side but uh thank you for having me honored to have you sir you did a podcast with graham Stefan and he showed you his Investment Portfolio you said something to him that massively changed the direction of how we invested just so you know rich people always enamored me like I thought they had some kind of special sauce or something there aren't any secrets I find something that they like and that they understand and that they're good at and they do it a lot your giftings are much more in the real estate world than they are in analyzing stocks if we were going to put a portfolio together of your knowledge base it would be 80 real estate 20 stocks maybe probably it's okay if your portfolio is real estate heavy the reason that that little piece of advice that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me was because everybody told me what they did and what had worked for them I talked to probably every guy that I know was who was richer than me and was like what should I do with all this and the answers that I got were as different as there are people under the sun yup left me more confused than anything when I looked at that pie and thought okay well what's my knowledge base it's all business I showed that clip to Layla my wife and I was like I think this is what we should do I think we should just stick to business and just buy businesses and grow them that's what we did with acquisition.com put money in stuff you understand and you love don't put money in stuff because it sounds fancy I'll bring us home because I had a and I could talk to you all day if you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave would you tell him you know now that you didn't know that play incremental long ball don't look for the home run I keep waiting for somebody to call me and for this to get easy one phone call and it's all over oh now I don't have to think about it anymore someone else is going to do it for me it's all automatic now we're gonna be automatics never gonna be easy it's a hustle and grind it's a claw you're going to make a bazillion mistakes make mistakes that are experiments that you survive you put out a hypothesis you survive the experiment to live another day to have another experiment put out another hypothesis another product that fails another idea that fails our failures at Ramsey are in number and in money are way greater than our successes the only thing is we survive them a we didn't have debt and B we never bet the farm on one horse and so we're not looking for the singular home run we're looking to survive and fight another day and keep iterating the accumulated value of those iterations are what we call the gleaming mountain of success which turns out as a pile of garbage and mistakes that you're just standing on rather than laying under it I didn't understand brand I didn't get it like with Jumanji was just all quantitative like it was all clicks conversions like that was all I kind of cared about going to the content world was kind of an experiment I'd done Affiliates I've done referral programs I've done paid ads I've done cold outbound but I'd never done content I'd never made it and then in making content you learn about brand I'm not saying I understand brand but I know more than I did it feels like once you start doing that you realize that what you were doing all before was wrong what's going on dudes I always like thinking like let me see if I can download any lessons if someone's making more money than me there's always something to learn I would say having a conversation with with Dave like it's just showing up he does three hours a day every single day for 30 plus years three hours a day I've shown up and making content he's 62. once you have the right strategy it's volume like you just need to do more but I think just seeing that level of consistency over 30 years like I'm grateful that I passed my 10-year Mark but I'm I'm excited for what the next 20 looks like that's very cool by like and talking or presenting I think I burn more calories your brain is 25 of your calorie tank and it consumes like most of your sugar but Coca-Cola will kill you except Warren Buffett still murdering it freaking regular Cherry Pope unlike Two by The World of Coke and keep it company wait for it wait for it and we're not dead one more flight in the books of not dying is it Saturday oh good I gotta get a good pump on before I go foreign good all right so we're gonna do I'll be a super set of calves and hamstrings with Blum owner of Raw Fitness I will train way harder if I'm training with a training partner I'll train longer I'll do more reps I'll do more sets just someone else holding me accountable and one of the nice things if you ever get the opportunity is to train with someone stronger than you just like you have limiting beliefs in business you also have limiting beliefs in in lifting and so when you see someone warm up with your one rep max it really shifts the way you see the weight gotta start with calves start with the most important body part Cavs were actually my weakest body part for a very long time and I actually had a girlfriend say why don't you train your calves and I've been training them for like three years so Blum and I have known each other for 11 years 12 years Palomas was the gym owner who had a gym I did not have a gym you lived in one yeah I would just basically harass everyone have them let me just come around a little clipboard and just take notes on everything they were doing I'm like Alex is the same Alex he would always be there asking questions that I had no answers to What's your turn what's your this and I'm like I don't know I'm 29 years old and I run a gym I don't know what you're even talking about I'm like what's your onboarding process he's like they sign up and then they work foreign [Music] about your legs apart then I'll do your shoulders and then I'll do back hard don't do arms science so I try in full body every day because I want to grow everything every day and I also have a irregular schedule so I don't want to be like Mondays back day Wednesday's leg day you know Friday shoulder tricep bicep and then like I missed two Fridays in a row and I haven't trained shoulders bicep tricep in like three weeks so I train everything every day bodybuilding and business are actually really similar in that you will have uneven inputs to create an even output because perfect business would have amazing marketing amazing sales amazing product amazing customer success but the individual might be like I'm really good at marketing and that's all I do and that's fine but the business needs to be balanced and so I kind of think of the exercises in the same way of like I'm only going to select exercises and I'm going to order them and do the most volume on the ones that I need to work on the most so that my physique overall is more balanced you know I think splitting your muscles typical brochure you're doing the gym if you just prepare biceps all right so that was our workout [Music] so we are heading to a photo shoot main reason if you've ever seen any of my other random images that have been taken the reason I'm not wearing a hat is because when we took the photo shoot last time we were in transition on the logos and I didn't want to take a bunch of pictures of the old logo hat now we'll have photos once again with the right logo and the hat and the uh the logo beater and the logo beater essential detail cookies ordered some cookies is that there's no one skips dessert on the table Yeah nowhere whatever fireable effects oh it's honestly yeah we saw you take the Brownie and slide it into the trash can after you've done your lunch didn't take the extra bite uh what's the deal here I'm not accusing I just won't understand why you never know when you're gonna need one sugar a little sugar well uh oh he's up I haven't washed my head since the gym it's good for your immune system people will do is we'll run through all the different facial expressions that we use for the thumbnails all the different flannels so we'll just bash those out [Music] I know a lot of you guys are like man you know what made me really like Rosie better that's completely crushed [Music] it's a bit of a girl post oh Fortress White you want to listen to feedback from the audience but you don't want the feedback from the audience to change your brand because Brand's your is your identity it's your reputation what makes you you and if you get funneled into like the algo hole of looking like exactly every other person who funnels for the algorithm then you lose the uniqueness of what makes you you and then you get the views but then the moment that your type of content no longer is in Vogue and something else is like your entire brand disappears overnight I missed the others from Garrix I think it was really good you are your own Niche everyone has multiple facets they just don't express them like I like eating dessert I also look kind of Jack I also am into business I also work with my wife it's just like people who [Â __Â ] with any of those things and [Â __Â ] with my stuff but if it was like challenges are really important that's all we should make yeah then I would be catering to something that's not me don't let me get too far [Music]\n"
