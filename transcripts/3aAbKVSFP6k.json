  "transcript": "success isn't fun um it's hard effort always goes end Noti get used to it you're good you you never bother us get it let us let us get it so there's this myth that probably happens with this influencer status of like we own businesses and businesses grow in like their last 3 months of Revenue have been like yeah so if you look at this here so what's been trending down as bookings so we're having Jesus yeah tldr kind took her eye off the B obviously was just down 60% of what it was yep but the thing about growth is that The Closer you zoom into it the more Jagged it looks and the more Jagged it feels you can feel the knife's edge of the up and the down and the up and the down every single day in this Vlog you're going to see me hop on a lot of calls and that's because that's what a lot of running our businesses is to Lea I nice to meet you nice to meet you too I mean you just you sprint from Air Conditioning to air conditioning hey what what Happ just cor roing it over here you know how it is hello you have two doors in your room it looks different it's clean now oh wow what's up man how's it going good congratulations on being you oh man congrats on being you I don't know how how a poor kid from Baltimore ends up in Vegas all right guys I'm going to go ahead and share my screen because of the proliferation of social media entrepreneurship appears to be the things that look nice so it's the private jets it's the cars it's the watches it's the money but the thing is is that all of those are outputs from business that people use for personal gain that then look attractive but the actual doing this every day of Entrepreneurship is predominantly communication it's talking to other leaders other employees teammates vendors customers and when you look at it on a real day-to-day of what that looks like it's a lot of meetings it's a lot of calls it's a lot of zooms and those don't look good on Instagram CU I've heard you talk about like paying for you know like knowledge or their expertise yeah at a certain point you actually stop being able to pay for expertise because when you start talking to people who have a shitload of money too like there's basically more valuable things than money to trade like that's where influence connections uh introductions you know deals things like that become a more valuable thing to discuss there's free communities there's paid communities there are benefits to both you know paid communities sometimes the the price tag is the gate to give you some level of qualifier of you know legitimacy like I mean even like you join a golf club where it's $100,000 a year to keep ling you're going to meet a caliber of people that don't care about spending $100,000 a year like it's a very different type of person have you just changed the five meals that you eat cuz like everyone thinks that they give up variety when they go on a diet they're like I can't just stick to this but people eat the same 5 to seven meals yeah so I put 20 pounds back on and so there's a key point there is I put it back on it wasn't like the first time I've been this way before um after the book launch and that was because actually going into the book launch um it was the longest period I think that I didn't work out I didn't work out for like 6 weeks most people eat the same five to seven meals and so they think that like changing their diet is going to have to be this massive thing but you really just need to find five to seven meals that you like because you currently already like five to seven meals and that's what you already eat and so you have to swap those for other stuff and if you just do that you're 80 90% of the way they are the older you get the fewer friends you tend to have and that's not because you're less social but it's because you have standards even then man Even though like my homiest of homies you can still like you just slowly stretch out communication then eventually just it just Fizzles like it's hard you have to maintain relationships so you just don't put the effort in to maintain it and then they usually just end like if you're not in close proximity that's the thing it's like most people's friendships are out of convenience they're not out of design and so they're just friends with people who were like lived across the hall from them but what is the chance that like the person lives across the hall from you is actually going to be a perfect fit for the type of person you want to be with for a long time probably not and so I think people let friends happen by accident rather than on purpose what would you consider like a a unicorn of a best friend like what traits would that they truly root for you and they make you better in multiple Arenas which is basically like they are competent in ways that you are not they have aligned interest with you and ideally their values align with yours that's a moment it's just very hard to do all three cont people what's happening uh we were going over a pricing issue for a software about to roll out in one of our larger portfolio companies and I think the one of the emphasis they did made the product not have a tenable pricing structure so we were able to catch it before they rolled it out which would have literally cost millions of dollars so we avoided that so great we got chops chops always smells good though though you notice that chops always yeah go for it yeah I'm going to get I'm going a little trim little chop I met Leila and I had short hair and she said I think you look good with long hair and I said okay and then I didn't cut it and so that was when my hair went from shorter to longer and it's pretty much just stayed there if you're an ugly guy you might want to consider growing a beard because it leaves half of your face to imagination so I had this the when we had gym launch uh this is right when we transitioned we right started making money and so remember we I had just been like looking at bankruptcy lawyers like a couple months earlier and so we have a a meet up of 28 gym owners that come to Alber cre New Mexico and I'm like super nervous because I'm afraid that they're just going to like think I suck or whatever right so the night before you know I was like trying to look nice and so I had Scruff and so I for all the guys who know this like you start shaving down and just like getting yourself in like different hair you're like all right I'm going to do the Wolverine and then I'm going to do mutton chops like you work your way down and so the last thing that I left was this this big Gunslinger mustache so like a big handlebar mustache and so I like looked out of the bathroom at LEL I was like hey um and she was like you look ridiculous and so I looked back in the mirror and I was like I think it's perfect and so uh uh that actually makes me sound cooler than I than I was what really happened is I when I looked in the mirror I was like well at least I won't take myself too seriously and so I figured that was that would like kind of get because I was so nervous going into it that I wanted to have some sort of comic relief for myself as like a visual reminder so I looked in the mirror I think everybody's got fuel it's just just not necessarily the one that is sexy so a lot of the guys out there are like find your passion find your purpose but I think for most people their purpose is like pay rent and not be broke and so like if that's what you got then that's what you use growth is painful because you become aware of your deficiencies reality shows you point blank all of the areas you're weak in and so when you've adjusted to something you've kind of filled the gaps you filled the holes between where you are and what is required for that current season but when you go into a new season or you go to a new level and you battle a new boss all of a sudden this guy has a whole host of different skills that you've never seen before and you just get your ass beat over and over and over again and those ass beatings hurt I mean every everybody has lots of things they hate like right now if I would ask you what are 10 things that you hate about your life it's probably you can come up with them pretty fast but if I ask you 10 things you're grateful for it takes a lot longer and so it's like rather than trying and get people to be different than who they are it's like find the 10 things you hate the most about your life and use that the reason use those as the reasons to to start working cuz I mean like whatever you're going to do is going to suck it's just whether it sucks less than what your current existence is and for me I had a lot of stuff that sucked and so I just wanted to change it's a nice backpack bro where's device cing up on um so the big thing that the internet doesn't understand is that like Leila operates acquisition. comom she's the operator she does everything she's CEO she actually is involved for the most part in the day-to-day of the business um I mean obviously I'll say hi to people you know around the office and whatnot any Shenanigans going on here no what was I going to ask you oh I was going to let you know um I brought the other half of the chair in oh awesome yeah I brought so it's right there where's toes solo cross the pond that is how we have found Lea and I work best together is I work on like big mey projects for extended periods of time that are huge rocks that move things forward and then Lea just like basically through force of will just keeps everyone on board everyone BL and continues to hire and train and and scale the business and that's what she's exceptional at I mean that's why we're able to build companies with such Enterprise Value so quickly is that she just understands building infrastructure behind things yeah I don't want to lose any mask going down those stairs yeah my dad told me he said he doesn't do cardio cuz he wants to save his heartbeats I was like check out sounds legit he's a doctor he's kidding he was joking that was a joke hanging you um I'm going to do this thumbnail and then I'll be Aude where are we headed we're going to uh ice coffee hour with graham Stefan and Jack Selby we're going to talk about iced coffee for hours now I don't actually I don't know what they want I don't know what they want to talk about cuz I've been on a couple times so I was like I hope I have something new to say so we'll find out cuz the thing is is that everyone is waiting for this like one home run that's going to like change everything and that basically never happens because it's all a game of incremental Improvement it's about small 1% improvements that add up over time and while you're making the improvements it never feels big it only feels big in retrospect and it looks like an overnight success from the outside because whoever sees the overnight success is never the person who experienced the overnight success because no one who actually is an overnight success would describe it as overnight because they always say you guys don't see the 10 years that it took me to get here I mean everyone wants recurring Revenue but no one wants recurring work and so it's this idea that everyone wants to just like get get get forever but no one wants to do do do forever and one doesn't come without the other and often times it's more like recurring work with zero recurring revenue for a very long period of time before you get your first far less amount of Revenue relative to the amount of recurring work you do I mean think about it until you win effort always goes unnoticed get used to it with whatever business you're getting into the more difficult is to get into the fewer entrance there will be so the less competition you have to compete against with the more barriers you have I'm always amazed at the amount of people who are like man this is hard and they somehow say that like it's a bad thing if it's hard good it means no one else will do it more for you like the hard the the level of difficulty that you have to go through in order to get whatever you want is literally the barrier that everyone else has to go through in order to achieve it too and so the bigger the goal that you have the bigger the obstacles that you have to get over which is why so few people will get it which is what makes it worthwhile to be begin with if it were obviously easy then everyone would do it and then it wouldn't be a goal because everyone would have it and right now it's not a big goal for people to breathe because everyone can breathe it's not a big goal for you to put your shoes on in the morning because everyone can do that and so therefore it loses its value what makes you exceptional is what you can do that other people can't do which means stomaching the harder thing is the thing that makes you the exception gr there we go what's up oh that's the uh mailbox oh where's the doorbell we're getting the doorbell move next week you're good what's up man I'm sweaty a little bit I'll give you one of these how's it going man H yeah nice to meet you pleasure pleasure you guys would make an amazing podcast together I have to say this would be a crazy conversation oh sweet super cool yeah but he's leaving right now for San Francisco oh fun therapy okay cool and they were out the mind that you thought the therapy wasn't very effective I'm a psychiatrist yeah yeah cool um and I was explaining to them that if you believe that therapy wasn't very effective you may be surprised because I'm inclined to agree okay well there you go then maybe we agree yeah I thought there would be a fun debate oh sure actually oh was four was a gift from you no no from Eric what is 1 hour of your time worth H I don't know I probably wouldn't do anything for less than 50 grand 50 Grand let's just say for if someone wants your advice 50 Grand an hour this if this podcast is 2 hours long yeah whoever's watching this is theoretically getting $100,000 of value just by listening to this so I just want to preface it by saying stick around for the episode you're getting a lot of value from this wow no that's fantastic no to the point that you might like why not make 50 million um I think that I want my brand to stand for something more than that and so I made it the mission to make real business education accessible for everyone and that is what I have been I have not wavered from that since I started doing this and I have two aspects to that one is like the distribution of how do I get this to everybody and how do I make it accessible and that has multiple levels to it which is one is like is it easy to understand but also like is it fun and entertaining and I'm getting better at that I think I'm I'm better at the easy to understand part I'm still working on how do I make this more entertaining so that like a stay-at-home mom will actually click and maybe get interested in something like this and maybe recommend her son or her daughter to like watch something like that I'm not there yet like but that's like in order for me to get that level of accessibility like I need to get better but on the flip side the context that the content is consumed within is basically my background so like at the very beginning you're like hey just for everybody who doesn't know here's this guy right if I had said hey I make $100,000 a year um listen to me I don't I mean I think fewer people would listen to me I mean maybe some would but like far fewer would listen to me as a quote Authority on on making money in general you can't have both growth and comfort one is the price of the other and so like if you're really comfortable it's probably an indication that you're plateaued that you're in the same space which then means that you have to voluntarily go into pain in order to come out the other side Better Stronger Faster\n"
