  "transcript": "$21.6 million in extra profit is what we were able to add in one single quarter in one of our portfolio companies by implementing a sales team and we went from zero sales guys to 40 sales guys in 120 days and so I want to walk you through the process so that you can apply this to your business but before I explain the $21.6 million increase let me kind of give you some context on this business and where it was in the life cycle we brought in Mercenaries so when I say mercenaries I mean an outsourced sales team the founder of the business had never been in sales at all he' never got on the phone he'd never done door Todo he' never done anything related to getting a stranger to give him money one-on-one I thought it was too risky to try and have somebody who's completely new to it try and start from scratch and so I called somebody in my network and I said hey do you want to make a bunch of money and he said yes can you round up some of your guys and start taking college for this company that I have and so they started taking sales and we started making more money we have a w money up W fantastic and in a second I'll walk you through all the statistics of what the mercenaries and the ouse team did which then led us to a fully in-house team now as you can imagine going from zero sales guys to 40 sales guys in a fresh company is hard but let me explain some of the problems with the mercenaries and then I'll walk you through the actual stats so there were three main problems with the mercenaries all right problem number one is that we were giving them 20% of the revenue all right now this is something that I was vehemently against to be very honest with you in this particular company I was in a minority position I said it's ultimately your call I was like but I would not do it at this percentage they decided to move forward with it anyways and hey we made money there was a w there but it was a problem 20% of Revenue coming in is a big check the sales team company was arguing we can't get the top guys to sell unless we give them a really big rip that's sales slang big commission so we had to give them 20% of the revenue that they collected as commission to The Mercenaries team the ouse sales team the second problem that came up is related to Performance they were getting less than 30% of people to ascend meaning people who buy the first thing to buy the next thing and we wanted it to be higher than that or I believe that it should be higher than that we're paying a lot and we're not getting as much out as we want the third problem with the ouse sales team and this is one that I think more long-term about because I'm investor in the business is is the sellability and Enterprise value of the business meaning in the future we'd like to the company at some point probably and even if you don't want to sell business creating a sellable business still makes the business more valuable and so if you can make a business more valuable to a stranger it also becomes more valuable to you if you have a outsourced sales team something that exists outside of the business that's responsible for 20 30 40% of the revenue in the business then that could be a material issue that's why we decided to look at these three things and say all right let's see if we can move this in house I'm going to walk you through first the funnel kind of before and after and then I'll walk you through the process that we did to fix it or swap it over that resulted in the $21.6 million increase in profit not Revenue profit the way that this process was structured is we had a two call set up we've got a percentage of people who schedule a call a percentage of people who show to the call and then schedule the next thing then they have to show to the next thing and they go to the next call and then do they buy so let me walk you through the stats here because everyone who bought the product had a first call that they wanted to attend 100% of people were scheduled to show up for this call with the Outsource sales team we had 74% of people who are actually showing for the call once they got on the call we're able to get 53% to schedule the follow-up call and so some people call this a qualification call which is if you're going to sell something else you want to make sure the person actually fits for the thing you sell makes sense right you want to make sure they have the problem to solve and the money to spend with the 53% the the Outsource team wanted to only give their closers because he's trying to optimize for his dollars per hour for his team only the easiest closes so they weren't willing to take calls they weren't already sure were going to close all right so because of that they were only passing 53% or almost half to the next call now again this is just scheduling now from here we had 63% showing up to call two so this is call one this is call two now this is the close call this is the set call this is the close I'll just put set this is close so the last box we got to fill in here is how many people were they actually selling all right and they were getting 80% of people who showed to the second call the closed call to buy all right and so that is where money came out the other side hooray so let's walk through the math as if a 100 people bought the product so if 100 people bought the product then it means that we'd have 74 74% of 100 74 people who would show up to this first call now of the 74 people 53% so about 37 of them would then schedule for the second call of the 37 people who scheduled for the second call we're going to have 22 so 63% 22 of them are actually going to show up to this close call now 80% of these 22 are going to close which means we'd have about 20 sales or 20% of that front end that ascends now remember I said at the very beginning one of the problems s is that we wanted us to be closer to 30 this is the issue and so I want to be very clear a big part of this was the price point we were selling at and the fact that we were selling people who are already customers we're not selling cold traffic here we're selling people who already bought this already demonstrated interest and we're saying do you want more help with that thing so we thought it should be much higher so there's five steps that we broke down that we had to do to go from out ofous team mercenaries to in-house sales team and the first one start started with hiring a director now right off the bat let me explain our thinking process before I explain who we were looking for and how we found them cuz listen you don't want to hire 40 people right you were thinking okay I want to hire one person who can then hire 40 people times a lot more circles right it's even long to write it out all right it's an old investor saying which is hire one to hire 10 we're going to hire the one person not the 40 that's the main decision after that what we're looking for is who who are we looking for what do they look like and then how are we going to find them okay now from a who perspective we wanted someone who had been there done that which means specifically somebody who sold this type of product in this type of industry and ideally scaled a big team and knows how to coach up new salespeople so that's what been there means for us for this particular role the next thing is you want the person to be metrics driven so one of the easiest ways that you can measure someone's Proficiency in any skills this little Pro tip the quality and quantity of metrics that someone explains about how they do their job is directly correlated with how good they are at the job and so if someone's like hey I'm an amazing HR person and I say cool what metrics do you track and they're like well the happiness of the team and I'd be like what else do you track how many complaints I get on payroll I'd be like okay what else do you track the order that they tell me the metrics they're looking at and what they track is going to tell me what they care about what they pay attention to and their level of of expertise now on the flip side if someone says hey I like to take companies from on average a 45 day time to fill to 20-day time to fill because we know that every day that a company doesn't have something they need they're losing money there's opportunity cost of Revenue they should be making by not having them this is really interesting because they're connecting their metrics to the company's revenue and so how people talk about the metrics and which met they track and how they connect those with how it makes the company more money will show you how good they are at what they do the third one is just kind of the I would say demeanor now I've HED a lot of sales people and sales directors in my life and the personality of a sales leader is usually not the same as the personality of a sales killer now there are some superstars who can do both but it's rarer often times the demeanor of sales directors is a little bit more even keeled usually more humble very servant oriented they have to be people people they have to be the type of person who wants to pour into the team and loves watching someone improve their skill set and can repeat the same directions over and over and over again without losing enthusiasm that's who you want you want somebody who's like a Energizer Bunny of of Positive Vibes because for the most part sales director is just Performance Management they manage the culture of the team like the output of the entire team is the direct function of the sales director and so if you think about this like on a on a football team or something you can switch the coaches and all of a sudden the whole team does way better it's because the coach drives the culture in the team that drives the performance and the output and so that is what they are responsible for and so if they don't have values everything else that comes from the team is going to be a diluted version of them now we go to the how you're like okay well that sounds like an amazing unicorn Alex how do you find that person who's going to replace this well I personally have a relatively large network of salespeople and so one of the big things here is that you can either this is the core four by the way you can do Outreach which means you reach out to strangers who you think might fit the role you can run ads so you run ads to go get more people content you could also do recruiter I've used all of these all right so there there's pros and cons to each of them but what I will do is I'm going to cross out two of these early for most of you most people think that you can run ads for these types of roles the reality is usually no the higher the role is the better the person is the less likely they're going to respond to an ad cuz think about it an amazing sales director is always going to have a job and always going to be making good money now they might not like their job as much as they they they could but they're going to keep making money and sales directors tend to be money oriented in general and so they're going to keep making money so ads is probably not the way to get them content unless you have a salesperson audience probably not going to be the way you can always try it it's free give it a shot but I wouldn't say I'm going to bet the farm on this so it's probably not going to be content and so usually you're going to do one of these two which is you're going to get a recruiter to do it or you do it yourself but guess what a recruiter does they do Outreach too I know this is going to sound crazy you message them and you say hey I've got this role and it looks like you're perfect for it could I tell you about it or if you want to be a little less direct you can say you're an amazing person who' be a fit for this role do you do you know anybody else like you they're going to be like screw everybody else talk to me Alex how many people do I reach out to five five no one's even going to read it if you message five people 10 no one's going to read it if you message 10 people reach out to 100 to 1,000 people and if you get to that 1% on the 100 and you haven't found it then you might have to go 1% on 1,000 and that's okay cuz remember would you rather have a top 1% sales director I sure this would so it's okay to turn down the first guy you talk to just cuz he has a pulse and has one of these things it's like okay this guy talked about metrics but he was a dick and he actually doesn't have the experience that I'm looking for well then don't hire him the thing is is it's tough to do that when you're an entrepreneur because you're like I'm bleeding every day the house is on fire I need this roll but I promise you it's way more painful to hire the person on board them spend two months run getting them up then they start hiring because they're a and then all a sudden you're like oh my God I hate this whole team and so even if you do get rid of the top you then have all the stuff they brought in underneath and so you have to clean house and it's really really painful and so as much as you hire one to hire 10 if you fire one sometimes you have to fire 10 and that sucks and so getting this hire right is super important but it's also why we spend more time on it so now that we hired our in-house sales director director we want to rebuild the compensation structure right because remember the 20% wasn't going to fly because if we just flipped it to 20 we might as well just save the effort right so we had to rebuild the incentive structure the problem that we had right now if you remember was that we had the pro I think it was problem one or problem two whatever problem one problem to whatever it was 20% of Revenue was going to the Outsource sales team so we wanted to make sure we were less than that our Target was sub 10% and that's usually around what I like to be in now I want to be very clear here there are things that this depends on so if you're in a business where the salesman does self gen meaning they generate their own lead so if you're if you're going out Bend and you're cold calling or you're door knocking then these percentages will be shifted because you technically are a cost of acquisition you're both marketing and sales you're getting the leads and closing the leads if you're handing salese leads if you're running ads you have a media team that then generates leads or prospects for a sales team then you basically have to split that cost between the marketing team and the sales guys and so given that let me explain how I actually think about this what skills do I need how rare are those skills so if I'm feeding softballs to somebody then I don't need Ken griffy to hit it out of the park all right for jiny uh mookie bets all right I don't need mookie bets to knock it out of the park uh because I'm soft tossing right anybody can probably rock it out of the park that's double AER up because at that level because it's so much easier if you have crazy expectations it's rarer and they have more skills so you got to pay more if it's something that's not a lot of skills and more common you can pay less and so I just think how much would I need to pay to attract the level of salesperson I need our goal is to take it from 20% to around 10% or less and rebuild the complant you can think about compensation in two columns all right you've got money and not money all right this a very complicated system I don't want to get into the specific a lot of physics behind this all right so you've got the money you give them for closing deals and then you've got other and so that's recognition praise attention approval perks status if you publicly recognize them if you have a leaderboard if you give them more attention you get you actually train them more you give them more skills you say hey out a boy awesome job great day today you say hey the guy who closes the most gets to park in the nice parking lot and then status like maybe when they close a 100 sales they get a hat with a stripe on it when they close a th sales they get two stripes and so forth so when you guys come on the team they're like I want one of those hats right sales team six let's go there's all these things that you can do to increase the value of the job outside of money and as much as people sales guys include will be like that doesn't motivate me sure as does all right it totally does cuz it makes your life better on the money side there's a couple ways to do this all right and so I'm going to explain how we did it i' we've we've made a lot of different compensation structures a lot of it depends on again the business that's involved now one of the big decisions we made up front was that we were going to comp Setters and closers now why is that so important the funnel is throughput if I can increase my show up rate by 20% it's just as good as increasing my closure by 20% it makes no difference the business they were just as equally weighted in terms of their value but again how rare are the skills and what skills were required it's easier to set than it is to close just as important but easier Setters and closers equally important but rarer to find a skill from closers so they got paid a little bit more but Setter still got commissions as well to incentivize the fact that they would get people to sh cool so the way that I prefer to set up compensation structures the idea that I like to have is that I like ww at the top which means winners win all right which also means losers lose that's fine there's more fewer winners than there are losers what that means is you can have ratchets for compensation meaning if you close 50% of the people I'm just using arbitrary number you get to keep your job if you close 60% you get out of boys if you close 70% your commission goes from 10% to 15% ah 50% increase not bad if you close above 80% you get 25% whoa right and so it ramps and so it allows the people who are absolute Killers to crush and then the people who are not guess what happens down here turn but this is structural turn this is expected turn this is part of the game with this type of role like if you require work ethic you require practice you require people show up early work late work weekends take calls it requires a certain type of person and a lot of people aren't cut out for it which is also why most people don't make multiple six figures of year selling we fixed the compensation structure we comped Setters and closers we ramped it so that the best guys would get more than 10% but we knew that as a team we averaged around if you want to know the actual number was we got the overall everything all in fully baked including the sales director for 9% we are feeding them qualified prospects they're not even prospects they're customers we already have their credit card like we just had to say want more of the thing you just bought want more help with that thing so you can get the outcome you just said you wanted like these are not hard sales and by doing this we got to move on to step three now that we rebuilt the incentive and comp plan to get the types of sales guys that we want on the team then we had to rebuild the process so I'm going to walk through what we do to improve each of these numbers one by one because as you're thinking about your business there is no Silver Bullet there's no one thing you're going to do that's change this entire process it's 100 golden BBS and this is how we approach everything in business and business is a pipeline like this and so I'm going to show you what we did and we did improve every one of these numbers except for one but it was okay and I'll show you why but remember 100% of people are automatic a ially booked for this next appointment all right and so we wanted to improve this show up rate and so we improved it to 91% oo 74 91 more money good that's a 21% increase meaning if we did nothing else we did nothing else in this entire process everything willse stay the same we would have a 20% increase in sales and most of that would disproportionately drop to the bottom line because we already acquired the customer so all this additional sales money goes to profit big deal so we did three things the first is that the mercenary team was way too aggressive in their copy false urgency false scarcity people kind of see through it um so that was number one that they did that we fixed number two is they were giving people way too much time to book out I'd say hey when do you want to show up for your next call people would be like oh how's 2 weeks from now and they were like sure our big rule of thumb despite the fact them trying to push out five plus days for appointments is we try to go for same day next day and that's because in our history more people show up the same the next day appointments than 5 days plus from now and so by just simply making the messaging less aggressive shortening the time when they can book their next call and number three setting reminders that were actually personalized so rather than just Robo texts they're the green ones that everyone hates right we'd have the sales guy do a three-way connection with the setter and say hey my name's John it's nice to meet you Sarah looks like you've got X Y and Z that I can reach from your account really excited to talk to you tomorrow I think I can help you with XY and Z very simple but it's a video or a voice memo and they see it from a real person all right and they can take a picture or whatever and those three things together 91% which is a 21% improvement so now that we got people to show for that first call how many of them did we get to schedule the next call which is basically the close of the set call you're going to see some magic happened right here we had a major Improvement I'm not going to tell you what is I'll tell you how much we improved this one in a second but we did two things to improve the percentage of people who showed up to set calls who decided to schedule close calls all right so the number one mistake that they were making in this particular business is that again this was an outsourc closing team and so they were trying to minimize how much unqualified work their closes would get because they so carefully wanted to make sure their closes were happy because they were all mercenaries they all had to pay them a ton just to show up to work every day point being one the incentives were misaligned and so Setters remember we added our Setters had a compensation stru to get people to set they didn't have that we did add that and so what do you know our Setters got more people to schedule wild I know the second thing was that they were queing people on the set call uh in my opinion too early and so they wouldn't really go through a sale they would just say hey here's the price are you down to pay that if yes I'll book you a call with John but by doing that they were basically not selling they were just taking orders which if I just tell you the price and you buy I don't need you you're not selling at all you're just a checkout page that's inefficient that takes 20% we corrected number one we we we aligned the incentives of the Setters with the overall business not the closer we aligned the setting incentive with the business throughput which got rid of the dqs that were overly deqing people and we made sure that when they were talking about the product we were just more trying to qualify the prospect to make sure they had the problem to solve and the money to spend not telling them the price of what they would ultimately buy cuz we haven't sold them yet we just want to make sure that this is a big enough problem for them and that they seem reasonably able to pay if we present it to them our schedule percentage went from survey says 53% to 94% for those keeping track at home that's a 77% increase so forgetting this one if we kept everything else the same and we only did this we would have increased sales by 77% assuming everything else stayed the same but everything else didn't stay the same so let me show you the next thing we did which is we had people show up for the first call we got 94 4% to schedule the next call and now we have what percent are these 94 actually showing cuz hey maybe you just get everyone to say yes so they get off the phone but are they actually showing believe it or not and this is going to sound crazy the show rate that we had here was actually the same process that we had here because believe it or not if people have a good experience and it's personalized to them they're more likely to show and so rather than explain literally repeat myself I'm going to say how we actually got the team to do it so we did four things number one is we started implementing daily training which means that every day the team would get together and they would roleplay the scripting to make make sure their tone was right that they were coming off the right way that they're hitting the main points make sure that they were framing things properly adding curiosity hitting the main pain points of the prospect was going to have so they could set up the next call number two is that we do gam tape reviews which is uh very simple but you just watch gam tape with the team and you have the person who is in the call critique themselves so rather than have everybody jump on them cuz no one likes that it's horrible you just have them say what are all the things you could have done differently and then the team says all the things they did well because remember there's always something someone did well you play the tape they say all the things they would have done differently and most people do know when they watch it which is one of the best ways to learn and then everyone else says hey I think you did a great job here I think you did a great job here Bravo next one up the third thing is this is why the sales director was so key and why they were the first tier was is doing one-on ones and one-on ones you role play like I you role play till you're sick in the face you have to learn how to train people how to speak like that's what the job of the sales manager is besides managing the culture of the team is if John's Rapport building sucks guess what sales manager does every time they have one with John they practice Rapport building right which means you follow the script no say it again well say it again try like this huh like there you go change your tongue there it is like we're talking 10 20 30 reps on one or two phrases in the script so they get it down if your salesman is not talking back to you in the script on your one-on ones you were literally wasting time the fourth thing was just end of day reports which is you just want to make sure that they know you're tracking what matters and if there's no tracking throughout the week no one feels held accountable it also doesn't give you the opportunity to praise and give out of voice all right and so every day the stats are getting tracked in real time and daily leaders daily winners all right so those are the four things we did from here to drive our show rate to wo 87% that's a 40% increase so if we did nothing else but we just had this one Improvement in this process and everything else stayed the same we would have increased sales by 40% not too shabby if you're following at home which you should be we should at this point have a ton more volume that is coming to these closers massive improvements cuz remember these are customers this is why we felt like we could do a lot better now hitting the close call so in order to improve this number to the best degree possible because we never we're going to have more disqualified people here remember we we told the Setters send anybody you can because we wanted to get more at bats okay so one we also added in a vssl so video sales letter between call one and call two so people got to have some social proof they got to see some results they got to have a better understanding cuz in my personal opinion I don't like sales people repeating a pitch I'd rather have someone understand the benefits and then have salesmen resolve concerns and personalize solutions to customers rather than have them say the same 15minute pitch because it then it sounds robotic and they zone out and so does the prospect so I like to say here's all the info watch that and then we'll talk about it okay so number one is we added that piece in number two we role played a lot on the common objections and we like to do that before the call the video sales letter covered some of these common concerns in the video so that the sales guys had a little bit more of an advantage going into the call and then also in the scripting we front-loaded the obstacles before you mention the price you overcome obstacles after its objections all right so if I say hey do you think your husband supports you in doing this new thing before I say the price then I've overcome an obstacle if I say the price and I didn't overcome it it becomes an objection which is way harder to close we call killing zombies right you want to kill the Zombies you want to defuse the bombs before you talk about money and so we front loaded the script to accommodate those issues that people were losing in the sales and we focused the script far more on what they were going to experience afterwards rather than the features within the service because at the end of the day they don't care about the features of service they care about where they're going to go what life's going to be like afterwards so sell the vacation not the plane flight so we made those changes and we got the right if you're like wait 42 is lower than 80 sure as hell is great myth if we're doing the percentages here and we have a 21% increase here and a 77% increase here and we have a 40% increase here so that's 1.2 + 1.77 + 1.4 we have far more than a double in terms of how much volume was going there in fact we had three and a half times more volume but we cut the close rate in half but 3 and 1/2 * .5 is more than 1 meaning we increased the total throughput of this system and so the end result of this entire process is we went from closing 20% of that 100 people that buy the product to 32 for a net Savings of going from 20% of Revenue to 9% so we paid less than half to get 60% more sales and as you recall all additional Sal sales dropped to the bottom line because we' already acquired the customers so now that we had our in house director we rebuilt the incentive and comp plant and we rebuilt the sales process now we wanted to scale so we had to go from zero to 40 reps and we had to do it in record time all right so number one is that to go get all those people we went everywhere all right so we actually did all the things that outlined but we also hired five to six recruiters right off the bat we did a ton of up on ourselves we hit our whole email list up we did everything cuz we had to hire 40 guys we had to do it in 12 weeks all right so number one is we did everywhere so plus ads actually didn't do there's more uh content and outbound all right so recruiters content and outbound is what we did to get all the people in the door now once we had people in the door we didn't have the sales director interview all these candidates because he just wouldn't literally have the time he did a final check off once the team planned on hiring them and so we had the manager for the Setters do the do several of the talks with the leads and we also had the recruiters do a lot of the screening as well so that the sales director could save his time and still keep managing the actual team and training the people who are on the floor making money for the company all right so saved director's time the next thing is okay great so we got a lot of people we got them hired but how do we make sure that they're actually good so we automated the sales training to the greatest degree possible now what does that really mean it means we made a course that was an internal course on how to sell this thing and so the nice thing with internal courses if you don't have them highly recommend it because the most expensive thing a business can do is train salespeople reason why is because when you take a salesperson and you train them on live prospects all of the money they don't close is money you lose and you lose all like you lose the money that you could have made and you lose the money that you spent to get them there very expensive all right especially when and this happens a lot too you do all of that only to have them get fired or leave or burn out or whatever all right and so we want them to take as many reps as humanly possible in a fashion where there's no risk to the company which is why we have them watch tons of gam tape footage they attend all the meetings they listen to tons of live calls they go through the course and then they roleplay there's one takeaway from this  video it's that you role playay with your team and that you get really really narrow on the things that you want them to improve and you keep nailing that thing until it's perfect and then you move to the next thing there's no point in trying to tell someone to prove six things doesn't work I promise you it doesn't work I spent too long doing this doesn't work you say let's work on the first sentence of the  script keep doing it again try it again try it again try it again one more time say it lighter say it faster Loop to this one got it second question right that's how you work through a script until they will they will be able to breathe it in their sleep then they can actually be present for the sales call cuz they don't have to think about the scripting cuz they already know it so we recruited the people we saved the director time we automated the internal onboarding I'm going to give you a pro tip from me which is that if someone seems like a dud within 14 days let them go some people think I'm heartless how could I be so heartless because I have other families I have to look out for too and if we don't keep the sales team profitable the whole business doesn't work we give people a shot we get to all this stuff we give them a ton of free training all right they actually technically get paid to get trained and if they don't if they're not up to chops we got to let them go but we set that expectation up front and one more thing and this is a a little Pro tip for me I don't know how to spell that but no Pradas all right so no special snowflakes because the thing is is even if you have one killer on the team and they don't follow the process they undermine the entirety of the process and they also kill the culture and so if one guy does double the sales of everybody else or triple the sales of everyone else I can almost guarantee nine times out of 10 to my experience they actually take those sales out of the organization overall so one guy triple and everyone's like oh we should be like him but the you if you have like a 20 person team and everyone goes down by 10% cuz of this guy cuz the cancer spreads not worth it just cut it out keep the system and now that we had the in-house director we rebuilt the incentive and comp plan we rebuilt the sales process we scaled the sales team and we stabilized it so that we were consistently beating the other team and doing it for less then we're able to move on to step five which is get rid of outsourced team so with the ouse team team we did $7 million in cash collected in q1 the commission on that was $1.4 Million remember 20% so the company got to profit 5.6 I'm saying profit Loosely 5.6 the company got to keep after paying the sale the out out sour sales team this 7% with the in-house sales team became $112 million the next quarter the commission because instead of 20% we went to 9% so the commission went from 1.4 million on 7 to 1.08 million for 12 net change here was 12us 1 10.92 million which created the difference between these two was 5.4 million doll and that was just in that quarter times four for the year and you get 21.6 million and so that is how we did that for one of the businesses and so if you have a sales team you're starting a sales team use this take the pieces that are useful for you
