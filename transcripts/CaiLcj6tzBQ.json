  "transcript": "I'm going to start a $10 million trash collecting business so if you want to start a business this video is for you we're going to turn this trash Into Cash the first thing you need to do is get customers and the easiest way to do that is to talk to people you already know and the easiest way to do that is to pull up your phone look in your contacts and find one let's call Caleb yo hey what's up man are you at that wedding I am yeah well quick question for you this may seem out of the blue is anyone taking out your trash oh [Â __Â ] no it's probably just sitting there smelling awful do you know anybody else who might be at the wedding who's also not taking out their trash probably but what are you talking about like I know this is out of blue I'll explain why so right now I'm starting my little Trash cleaning business I want to help five or 10 people and just do my service for free I'll do everything and if it is good if you're open to leave me a review it mean the world to me and if it sucks I hope you tell me so I can make it better dude that would be perfect and I'm a ger F I [Â __Â ] hate touching well I'll tell you what why don't I do it for free you're you're helping me out if it's good and you like the service I can talk to you about you know what it would look like afterwards in like two weeks that work that sounds incredible yeah thank you and uh the other folks that you know do you think you do a three-way text intro with me yeah absolutely thanks for supporting me man I really appreciate it so that is number one of four different ways that one person can let other people know about their stuff there are eight ways in total but today we're only going to talk about four of them and they are called unsurprisingly the core 4 welcome to Money Center where we break down this week's money-making activities here we've got a strapping men in what appears to be a tuxedo tank top we're going to watch this game footage are you at that wedding interesting first question I'm guessing this is a personalized tidbit that he found out from the social medias doing a little pre-research or pre-search this may seem out of the blue is anyone taking out your trash woo and right for the right for the jugular all right let's see what was just happening all right so we acknowledged what they said they were going to the wedding the compliment was that oh that's nice now could he have gone for a better compliment for sure I'd give that a four out of 10 on the compliment scale now what he didn't do was tie to a positive character trait that would have been bonus points now what does he do next he asks another question and leads the conversation whatever Direction he wants to go in this instance talking about trash anytime someone is doing something that you want to do for them they spend the same resource which is time and so all you have to do whether you're traving Fitness Services cleaning services trash taking out Services IT services whatever it is you say hey how's all this stuff going they say great and you say how do you have time to insert the thing that you're trying to sell and everyone's like man I wish I had more time and you said oh boy I just happen to be a time salesman and I can give you some back all right let's go back into this game footage it looks like he's following a script which makes it less impressive or does it he's actually following a script because if you don't know what you're doing just stick with the script rpt I think that's what he's actually reading do you think he can read do you know anybody else who might be at the wedding who's awesome he already assumed the clothes on this one and he's going for more do you know anybody who is looking to dream outcome not have the trash during the wedding as a quick tidbit this is an outline it's not going to be perfect and honestly when you do 20 or 30 or 50 of these you'll start to find your own Rhythm these are the big things if we're thinking about these as Milestones it's like hey I'm not asking them I'm asking if they know anybody now in this particular instance the guy was like man I he clearly exhibited the issue but if you've been like no I actually do have somebody who's taking care of the trash or whatever couple directions you could go there it' be like awesome are they doing it for free and then they would say no and be like well I will and then boom you could get the business or you just say hey do you know anybody who is it's a very easy transition so you're not asking them for business you're not soliciting you're asking if they knowbody and so then you give them the reason why because I'm taking on five case studies now case studies is a word that I didn't use in this but if you said hey I'm taking on five trials or five people for free and I'm just trying get some testimonials some reviews okay let's go back to the uh the game footage and if it sucks I hope you tell me so I can make it better and we just outlined both outcome scenarios in the explanation which is either I'm good and you leave me a review which is my ask or I suck and you just tell me so either you get feedback or you get a review and it works great and the nice thing is you can make money three different ways from somebody for free cuz everybody in the stands is like he going to make money give them away stuff for free your time is valuable your time isn't valuable because if it were valuable you'd be making money and if you're not making money right now guess what value says zero this gives you practice and feedback from friendlies which is a great way to start category one is that they will get the free service and be like this was awesome keep doing it and I'll pay you they literally just become customers option two is they then say hey I don't want to do this but I'll leave you a review so then you get a review version three of them making you money is that they just send you a friend even if it's not them and they could do all of those things somebody could leave your a review send you a friend and become a customer but they could do any of those things individually and if you want Secret Door Number Four they could also say you know what you weren't good I don't want to send you a friend and I don't want to be a customer but I'll tell you what you could do better and that also makes you money in the long term why don't I do it for free you're you're helping me out and see notice the frame you're helping me out letting me do this for free it's not hey you owe me one because I'm doing this for free for you wrong frame of mind if you come in at that you're going to be a weirdo and everyone's going to sense it cuz you're going to have this weird resentment WS people because you're like I can't believe I'm giving the stuff away for free they should be thanking me no they shouldn't cuz you have no reputation and you have no track record cuz if you did you wouldn't have to give it away for free but you are because you haven't done it yet and that's okay I'll and notice he's still reading from this this screen so he might not even have a brain brains are optional in this that's how simple this is when you ask people who know you the other folks that you know do you think you do a three-way text intro with me ooh snuck it back in so remember earlier he said hey do you know anybody he said yeah I do know some people he remembered and said hey why don't we do a three-way not the way you're thinking I see you but how do we do a three-way intro and the reason you do that is because if you say hey can you make the intro to me they have to remember but if you say right now hey do a three-way text while I'm here there's two things happen one is that you get the lead and here's the second sneaky thing that happens is that because you actually have an intro of a third party in the message group the person who's getting intro is way less rude overall I think I think 4 and A2 out of 10 maybe a 4.6 and I'm mostly giving that because of the hair and the tuxedo tank regardless this goes to show you that you don't need to have a brain you can follow half of a script and you can still get a customer by talking to people who you know and asking them if they know anybody and just like that you can start your trash cleaning business because there are four ways you can make money from free people they become customers they leave you a review who get you a customer they send you a friend or they give you feedback that could make you better so that you can eventually actually be worth what you want to charge but there are two limitations Let's Walk This Way first limitation is that you only have so much time you're going to be calling people you're going to reach out to people and trying to get them to try your services or your products of some sort you can only do that so many hours of the day cuz it's just you limitation number two is that you only know so many people you add up your email list your contacts in your phone your followers on social media across every platform that you're on if you're on platforms you might have a thousand people who know you well if you did a 100 of those a day in 10 days you would have reached out to everybody now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't reach out to them again you should but at that point you start to run into some friction so we just got our first customers from warm Outreach as in talking to people we know oneon-one now we're going to transition to getting our first customers from posting free content let there be light is it on cool want to know the best way to get your husband to take the trash out two things number one instead of saying hey honey will you take the trash out you say hey would you mind taking the trash out hey would you be opposed to taking the trash out would it be a huge inconvenience for you to take the trash out if you say it like that instead of of a yes based question it's a no based question cuz they're like no it wouldn't be a huge inconvenience I wouldn't mind at all and then they take it for you because people are more likely to say no to things then yes but you get them to say yes by saying no the other way to make sure they keep doing it is that after your husband or your spouse does it that you reward them for doing it and that's where you say thanks so much that meant so much to me it's like you're my hero any of those types of things make it more likely that someone's going to do it again now if you don't want to use any of these persuasion tactics just call 1800 Alex TR and I'll do it for you and you can say you got it for your husband as a gift because he means so much to you trash is gross to everyone but me but if you're one of those people there's three ways that you can actually not have to touch your trash way number one use a bag you take the bag just like a pooper scooper you take your hand and then you can go over the whole thing and then you dump it way number two is you use tools like these go down touch your trash and there you go hands free and way number three is you can call 1800 Alex trash because I love the smell of trash and I will do it for you and you are helping somebody who actually has barely any way to smell and so I wear these because I can't smell that good and so this is a natural line of work for me because I get to do something that doesn't bother me at all and bothers other people here's how making free content Works do you make free valuable stuff for your audience so much so that they say give us more give us more could either be more free value or paying you money for the services that you offer now let's actually break this down in Real Time with these videos want to know the best way to get your husband to take the trash out what was that that was part one of content which is hook now notice how many seconds is that 3 seconds in the first 3 seconds are the most important 3 seconds in the content video two things number one so notice I have a two-step framework that I then introduce in the beginning give step one give what it is then give an explanation of why it works and then I move on to step two and repeat the cycle and so that that is a retaining cycle which you can either use lists steps or stories or combinations of all three to keep the audience engaged and right now I'm going through list steps and stories making this now let's keep watching this one and see where this guy takes it just call 1800 Alex trash and I'll do it for you and you can say you got it for your husband as a gift because he means so much to you and so the idea with the reward is that you want someone to share the last piece so it's either something that subverts the audience meaning something that they laugh at or think is funny or it's some sort of action that you're going to have them take now ideally here this is funny enough that someone would send it to their friends now let's look at number two and break this one down together trash is gross to everyone but me so trash is gross to everyone but me is a weird but probably effective hook because curiosity people like why is this person talking about this and the thing with content is you're going to make many many many things and sometimes you would be surprised by what works and what doesn't so often times you can start with a crazy topic or you can start with a crazy question or or just a fact or a statement that people might find jarring any of those things might catch someone's attention so that they keep watching way number one use a bag and so each of these is an open loop so I'm opening the loop and then I close it with what the thing is but you're still like well what's number two and what's number three and the idea is that you retain them so that they watch it and way number three is you can call 1800 Alex trash because I love the smell of trash there you go fun little wrap up on the video we've got a hook we've got some retention tactic which has a a step for a story and then some sort of reward or call to action at the end and just like that we have made two pieces of content following the hook retain reward framework that you can use for any type of business now Pro tip on this if I were to start a local trash business I would say there's one of two directions I would take my content in general you could also inter splice them one is actually talking to Consumers and saying here here's some tips about trash you probably didn't know about things that can make their life better independent of using my services or you could make content targeted at people who you would want to work work at your trash company so it might be targeted more around what a Salesman job or a trash collecting job might look like so that you can attract more Talent either of those strategies work and you could probably do both together cuz you would eventually just be known as the trash kick all right I'm going to give you a couple quick tips that have worked well for me on making content number one people need to be reminded more than need to be taught so a lot of times we have this idea that I've said this thing one time in content therefore I should never say it again because I would be repeating myself but it's arrogant to assume that 100% of your audience 100% of the time consumes 100% of your content and also that if they consume something one time they wouldn't want to consume it again Andor a version that's just slightly different from the original you'll probably see tweet reels from me that also appear in video format for me that also make their way into captions and full posts on the exact same concept and then I also talk about them in podcast think about yourself who do you follow you probably know the themes of stuff that they're talking about on on a regular basis and you follow them because you want to be reminded I've watched comedians do the same bit over and over again because I think it's hilarious and so it works the same way with your own content if people like something make more of it another one is that in the content that I just showed you I made a call to action at the end you could obviously not make a call to action at the end at all you could just make the content and cut it and then that would be perfectly fine and you could just expect that people would make comments they would like it or sometimes DM you anyways just cuz they want to find out more I think that that one actually would work because I made the third weight kind of funny and the cool thing is is that anybody who likes or engages or comments on your posts are leads because you can then message them a lead is a person you can contact and an engage lead is someone who shown interest in the stuff that you have we create content so that we can get people to engage so that we can then say hey I saw that you engaged with my thing that gives you a reason to reach out to them without seeming like a scumbag and so like that is how you can generate leads for free using content I'm going to give you a frame shift that helped me a lot in the beginning when you're making content looking at the number of views can be depressing because then you think man I suck no one likes me but I started to imagine whatever the number of views was as the size of a room I was talking in and so if I was willing to do a lunch and learn for my trash business with 15 people in it I was stoked and so the idea that 17 people watch my video is a full room it's a classroom and so the idea that I could do that and reach them for free just reframing it and not comparing it to what a million clip view is but just saying what does 17 people look like wow that was worth it and if you can keep that perspective it becomes way less discouraging and everyone starts at this one big magical number it's not bad it's not you suck it's not that you're late everyone starts here and you build from there and so that is how we got our customers from our second different way to advertise posting free content now we'll transition to reaching out to strangers oneon-one to get our next [Music] customers hello hey how's it going pretty good reason I'm knocking on your door is because I helped the Johnson's your neighbor take out their trash and they sent me over here to ask you if you have somebody who takes care of your trash for you I do not well would you be opposed to me doing it for for you no no actually that sounds incredible all right well fantastic so if you have any trash right now I can just grab it yeah I'd be good with it yeah all right fantastic cuz I can take that out to my truck and then I'll get the rest of your stuff I do not want to touch it honestly so like that would be very helpful thank you hello hey how's it going good reason I'm here because I took out the Johnson's trash it's what I do for a living and I was curious if you have somebody who taks out your trash I do yeah yeah well are they as awesome and smiley as me I guess not do they also do it for free for this month no because I'll do both of those the extra Smiley stuff is on me if it's actually free yeah yeah it's free for the first month and after that it goes at 29 bucks a month okay yeah yeah let's do it okay fantastic well if you got a bag I'll grab what I have and then I'll bring them out to the truck and I'll come back with my cleaning supplies yeah let's do it all right hey how's it going hello hello I take out the Johnson's trash and they wanted me to take out your trash so guess what just happened I got to know and guess how much poorer I am 0% poor and so you know what yeses can change your life but you can have as as many NOS as you want and nothing else changes and so all we do is we roll the dice again d D dum dum dum dum and we're back for the cold Outreach breakdown it is you reaching out one1 to strangers and you can do that via email phone call direct message SMS voicemail or knocking on someone's door like I demonstrated now let's break down these puppies one by one this was the nice guy reason I'm knocking on your door so right before we get into this there's a lot of setup here so number one I have trash over my shoulder the reason for that is because I'm already visually demonstrating what I do and it's especially I'm dressed in work clothes you might think is this person here to fix something I have curiosity working on my side cuz he might have a peephole or look through the window before answering the door which most people do so before even getting the knock in the door I'm trying to look a certain way so that it increases the likelihood that they open the door now the second thing is that I've got a huge secret weapon that most people don't do so the reason I talked earlier about giving away free stuff is that once you do give one person free stuff what do you think you should do with that free person you should leverage it to the greatest degree possible to make as much money as you possibly can for giving away something for free because if I can get 10 more sales from the one person I gave for free by name dropping them or by using them as an intro or a segue into a sales pitch that's worth giving away the service for one person and so in this example the Johnson which is the neighbor I could give one person in an entire neighborhood free service and then go to every other door and say hey I work with the Johnson's which then creates trust and they're like okay this is legit and then I can bridge in so right now do that in the first couple seconds cuz I want to disarm them so they don't act rudely to me if someone knows that you know someone they know they will act much more polite to you and be far more likely to give you more time to make whatever presentation you want to make and they sent me over here to ask you if you have somebody who takes care of your trash notice the question that I'm asking after proceeding it with I help the Johnson's out I ask the individual does he have somebody who's doing this particular service cuz I'm not saying hey do you want me to take your trash out for you I'm asking if they have someone who's doing it because then I'm leading them on a path that I have an answer on both sides it's a yes no question that I have 100% response that's good on either scenario I do not so this one is an easy one cuz they're like I don't have anybody who does this particular service and believe it or not as crazy as it sounds it's actually even better sometimes that they do have someone because that means they already are willing to pay for the service so by the way if someone already has or pays for something they're more likely to buy from you not less would you be a opposed to me doing it for you and so that's a no-based question so rather than saying hey do you want me to do it I'm saying would you be opposed to or to be a great inconvenience to you Etc where it's an easier yes by saying no than a pure yes- based question for all the yes based salesmen myself included I've closed plenty of sales I'm just saying you ready to start open to go on Monday let's get started whatever it doesn't mean it doesn't work it just means that in general when you ask a huge population a slightly higher percentage will say yes to a no question no no actually that sounds incredible great we got the yes and we move on now as a side note here once you get the yes shut the [Â __Â ] up and go everything you say after the point they said yes is increasing the likelihood that they changed their mind and so as soon as you get the yes it means that you've said everything is sufficient and everything after that point increases the risk that they reverse their answer you got what you needed get to the [Â __Â ] truck get your [Â __Â ] move back there and then get it done now let's go through the scenario of I do have somebody already and I was curious if you have somebody who taks out your trash I do yeah yeah same question she's asking if they have the provider or not now he says yes here do they also do it for free for this month so I now have to have an alternative scenario that I can plant like an alternative offer also as an aside in a life scenario you want to sound like someone they know and people they know don't say hi the reason that I'm calling is if you were on a call script you'd say hey is this Jason pause and they'll be like yeah be like hey this is Alex pause and then and then they're like where the [Â __Â ] do I know Alex from now here I ask I'm like hey how's it going I'm not saying hey my name's Alex and I'm here to take your trash out and I want to like breathe are they as awesome and smiley as me I'm a big Rapport guy I like cracking jokes at all times in sales now that takes a little bit more skill but it disarms people and people are way less likely to be rude to somebody who's just being incredibly positive upbeat and sunny and so you can be as ridiculous saying well do they give you free Smiles it's such a pattern up that people are like what the what is this guy saying they're not going to be like [Â __Â ] you they're going to be like you know what I no they don't give me free Smiles they be like well they should be cuz with a house like this I mean how much trash you must be creating a ton of trash and that makes my job better I love trash right like I could say that kind of stuff and they're like God this guy's insane but like at least he's funny and so I could literally have the exact same service and just CU they like me better they'll give me the business but I pair that with what I say here is are they giving it to you for free no no no they're not guess what that makes me better than the guy that they have right now and so then it's like cool he did me a favor on this he's like so it's just free forever and it's like no it's not free forever but I can Cod to my truck come back and be like yep just to be clear like it's going to be free for this month so the next three pickups or four pickups are on the house and that's just a way to earn your trust earn your business and hopefully give you some free Smiles on the house and then after that it just goes at 29 bucks a month great you have your IDE on you cuz I'd ask for that he'd go get his wallet he'd come back with his ID so they come with their ID you write down the information say cool can I trade you for the card you want to use you hold on to it until they give you the card then you swap cards you write down the credit card information so that they don't mess up the number because if they write it down they might change a number so it doesn't go through so you write the card information say awesome let me get your autograph boom number three the one that everyone's afraid of I take out the Johnson's trash and they wanted me to take out your trash I will tell you this if you ever do door to door which is the most aggressive of the sales like the hardest one to do in my opinion you will earn respect forever from everyone everyone knows what it takes to be a door to door salesman it's like you have to have thick skin and you got to learn how to talk to people if you look at Jeff basos you look at Bill Gates you look at Mark Cuban you look at Warren Buffett you look at some of the most successful people in the world they started in a door to-door face tof face toe-to-toe selling environment where they got to get rejected you have to learn how to sell as a base skill and it doesn't mean that you have to make money from selling but you have to learn the skill because you're going to have to sell your wife you're going to have to sell your kids you're going to have to sell your employees you're going to have to sell your investors you're going to have to sell customers and so learning how to get rejected and moving on with your life and realizing that nose are just coins that you toss in the machine where you roll before you get your win you can just remember that that you're putting it together Brick by Brick the success that you want built on nose then you get to where you want to go faster and just don't take it seriously that guy's having a bad day has nothing to do with me I'm just asking if he wants to take his trash out hey in case this disclaimer wasn't obvious this is a studio setting and we did it this way so that we could have perfect illustrations of each scenario real life is hardly that clean some people answer the door with a gun but this just gives you an idea of just how to literally take the first step knock on the door talk to the stranger ask the girl out do the thing and not be afraid of getting no because no is the price of yes so cold Outreach presents three problems that we will need to solve together problem number one is that you don't have their contact information number two is that even if I did contact them what do I say which comes down to a script and an offer and the third thing I've got the contacts I know what to say what my offer is but I'm not getting enough replies number one if we're trying to solve how do you contact someone you have to build a list so you build a list in three ways number one is that you build it with software just Google software for list insert whatever your avatar name is for plumbers for home services for whatever you pay a monthly fee you export a list that meets your criteria the second way you do it is you go to Brokers Brokers are people who own lists and they sell those lists to multiple people and so you go to Mr list broker you say hey this is a list that I'm looking for how many you got and they'll say I've got 177,000 contacts that means these criteria you say awesome how much and then you do a little negoti negoti and then option number three is you use the old elbow grease method which is that you assemble the list yourself now assembling the list yourself is in my opinion the most valuable way to do it because it's going to be a virgin list in the first two scenarios other businesses are also going to that software also going to those Brokers and so those leads might be tired of getting hit up it still works the long-term in my opinion best way to do this is to find the leads yourself and you do that through looking at Yelp Google Maps databases that exist online for free and you basically scrape them yourself you can also go to Facebook groups Reddit forums things like that where people are already assembled together all of these things are ways that you can build lists and the list should just have the way that you can contact them the second is you're like what do I say well I have the script inside of $100 million leads you can do that now the second part is bfv you're like what's bfv bfv is big fast value you'll notice that what I said with him was I had a free offer ready in my back pocket so I could disarm him if you're talking to strangers they're not going to be as friendly as the people who know you they're not going to be as polite and so you have to be even better with them with an amazing offer I'm saying something that is superior to what other people are charging for you'll be able to win more business and it's actually one of the biggest Force multipliers especially on cold Outreach to get people to say yes because they don't trust you so you have to give them a big incentive to do it anyways the third is I'm not getting enough replies and you solve that with one thing volume volume of reach out being willing to accept NOS 100 no a th NOS to get to your yes and we do that through Automation and through collaboration so you get other people to do more volume with you and you also do technology to automate different portions of reach outs because believe it or not every part of this process of building the list uh getting your you know phone system set up if you're doing cold calling if you're setting up accounts to do cold DMS all of these things are automatable to a great degree and so get good at Tech because it will give you huge leverage on the amount of replies that you will get back for the effort you put in and so method number four is one of the biggest baddest methods because it is the fastest and also the most risky to do but if you know how to do it well you can get bags of this this is money a bag of money so we just knocked on doors of complete strangers to get our first customers doing cold Outreach and now we'll transition to our fourth and final of the core 4 running paid ads are you backed up in trash you smell that smell is that what your Sunday night smells like when your trash is built up from the whole week does the smell of your trash drive you bananas because that time is over now what's that you missed your child's practice again you didn't get to watch your favorite show again you only have so many minutes in the day why would you spend it taking out your trash Alex did you take the trash out I'm watching the game on my phone ever feel like like that you don't have to anymore what's that you love trash as much as I do no impossible no one loves trash more than me and so why would you rob me of the opportunity to clean your trash up for you is this you every trash day a I missed it no if this is what your Monday looks like or whatever your trash day is the day after you miss it then you know exactly what I'm talking about and so having seen house after house after house busy professionals working home forgetting to take their trash out running after the truck to try and get it only to realize that they have to smell their trash for another week or until the next pickup day it's terrible and so I decided to make a business just to solve that problem and so we do three things better than everybody else number one is that we will never miss a pickup day ever we guarantee that because if we ever do we will give you three free months if we miss even one pickup day because we're so reliable at it number two is that we will always be on on time and so you're not like when are they going to pick it up I know it's out there so your trash isn't just sitting on front of your door for a day while you wait for us to pick it up we say that we're going to be there at 7:00 we're going to be there at 7:00 and the third thing is is that you will only hear two statements from our team yes sir no sir yes ma'am no ma'am that's it it's surfaced with a smile if that sounds interesting click the link or call 1800 Alex trash dum dum dum dum dum dum we are here running paid ads today the fourth of the core 4 talking to people who don't know you one to many this is how running paid ADS works there's lots of free value in someone's Newsfeed whether it's their television that they're watching or they're looking at the Instagram or the Tik Tok and then there's a PID ad that goes in between the value that they're receiving and then these are the strangers which you pay the platform to gain access to now when we run a paid ad there's really three parts to it you've got the hook you've got the meat of the video which is just like retain by the way if you're like hook retain reward it's like very similar the only difference is at the very end we're just going to make a call to action right whereas in a piece of content you might not do that and just have some sort of funny moment or something that makes it more sharable that's the main difference between the two and so the way that I've made ads cuz I've made ads for a long time the bulk of my material net worth has been made running paid advertising so I have a decent amount of experience doing it so let's watch together are you backed up in trash right off the bat we do have the hook which is a question it's a yes based question are you backed up now I have three visual cues here to create curiosity and create a call out and filtering mechanism man with glove trash slightly in the background so this just looks weird and so I'm going to get someone to maybe give me a half a second of their attention if this is what your Monday looks like so what I just did was present the problem you'll notice that all three of these things is simply honing in on who I want to respond because when you're with ads the reach is guaranteed you're spending money to reach eyeballs you want to make sure the ad communicates that this is for this specific type of person so they respond you'll notice there's different ways that you can start an ad with a call out all right so the call out usually goes before the hook the call out is you're trying to say to this specific Avatar this is for you you can do visual call call outs or you can do auditory call outs visual call out is something can see with their eyes that says this is for me an auditory call out is me saying Las Vegas homeowners this is who I'm talking to which is the best hook is saying this is for you and then you put your real hook which is the question or the lead to the ad forgetting to take their trash out running after the truck to try and get it these are all just paint points people who are busy at work they don't have time they're coming back home they're forgetting their trash day only to realize that they have to smell their trash for another week or until the next pickup day pain they have to smell their trash because they forgot about it and it's sitting there the whole point here is we're agitating the pain we're bringing up like oh yeah this is important I really do need to fix this this is something that I hate having to deal with and so we do three things better than everybody else so notice I'm then introducing three things all right so when I was selling fitness programs I sold Fitness Nutrition accountability trying to come up with three things for whatever the core service helps people know that you're about to tell them what it is so that opens the loop so they're more likely to listen and then it just gives them a way to organize the information so they can know the benefits and I've just found three works great number one is that that we will never miss a pickup day ever and so I present the probably the biggest pain point that they have because that's what I intro the clip with I put my guarantee right in the middle sometimes you can put the guarantee at the end sometimes you put the guarantee at the beginning so you can move the guarantee around it felt like it matched most with this pain point and saying not only that just to go above and beyond I'm going to deliver this really fast value crazy amazing offer so if we miss one day we're going to give you 3 months free now all you got to do is make sure that you don't do that and if you have a business then why would you miss it but it sounds insane number two is that we will always be on time all right the other issue is like what other pain points are there it's like well even if you know that what day that someone's coming there do you want to have trash poed up in front of your house it's another pain point so the deeper you know your avatar and the deeper you know the pain points that they're experiencing around whatever the problem is the more detailed you can be in description of the pain and so copy and advertising is about the details the smell of the trash the chasing after it the having it pile up in front of your house the smell when Neighbors come in not just like you smelling it but like have you ever had somebody else come in cuz that affects status so there's different ways that you can attack the same same problem the first one I say might not be the one that they feel like they suffer from so I want to say multiple things so that one of them hits a pain point and they're like wow this does affect me and the third thing is is that you will only hear two statements from our team yes sir yes ma'am what's the next paino is they probably have a lot of low-skilled laborers who pick up trash who are not that friendly and don't have a lot of Rapport and so for me to just Elevate our service to everybody else to say yes sir no sir yes ma'am no ma'am because in today's day and age no one treats anyone with respect and so my company would be about that because respect would be a paino for these types of individuals and now we transition to CTA which is the call to action so that we actually get them to do something from this app if that sounds interesting click the link or call 1800 Alex trash and that is one example of the app you can have one or two or three kind of meaty portions of it where you hit on the pain a couple different ways maybe talk about the benefits in a couple different ways but you can have way more hooks because the hook is going to be the most important part of this ad because 80% of people are going to decide not to watch your ad in the first 3 seconds so that's the part you test the most if you can get them to buy the ad in the first 3 seconds you have bought yourself more time to consume the rest of it is this you every trash day so it's a yes based question in front of two visual call outs that look like somebody you is a homeowner who is trash that would be the hook you smell that smell is that what your Sunday night smells like yes based question with a very weird intro that might catch people's attention does the smell of your trash drive you bananas so that is a yes based question with humor and like if I wanted to attract doctors I wouldn't dress this way and I wouldn't be in the setting so the setting and the Avatar of the person in the ad will do more to attract the right types of people than anything else if you want to track more women put women in the ads and if you're like man I'm a guy and surprisingly all of my clients are men it's probably because you're in the ads so if you want to have twice the reach have two or three or four different people in the ads that you have it's one of the easiest ways to double or triple your business or lead flow what's that you missed your child's practice again didn't get to watch your favorite show again all right so here's two yes based questions that those are both pain yes based questions if they say yes I have been missing these things then I connect that to trash I'm bridging it to the trash problem it's really a problem of not having time I'm just choosing to put that towards trash what's that you love trash as much as I do so just like that we've got a hook and a lot of there's visual action at the beginning of this to break the attention of the normal news feed that someone might be experiencing or the TV that they're watching Alex did you take the trash out I'm watching the game on my phone so that is a relatable moment that every man has had when they get asked to take out the trashes you're just doing something else that you'd rather do besides take the trash out and so each of these hooks can lead right into that original first video I sent you just cut off the first 5 seconds and then you use this and then it Clips right to there's three things that we do better than everybody else and then we go right into it and that's how you make pay adts and that gives us the fourth way that you can get customers in the core for for trash business or any other business you want to start and when we put them all together it looks like this boms [Applause] [Music] away so it'll be a montage of you throwing trash bags over your shoulder dumping it into the big recepticle you're going to be spraying the money gun everywhere cuz you've turned so much trash Into Cash we'll edit this down for YouTube we'll make it for the podcast we'll post on Tik Tok shorts everything what do you think I think that idea is garbage\n"
