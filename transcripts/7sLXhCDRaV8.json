  "transcript": "I want to break the myth in this video that you need to go make a million dollars that you need money to make money one two three four five six ten different ways you can make a million dollars for little or zero money down and you can apply this to a thousand dollars a hundred dollars a hundred million dollars you can do any of these things and add or to track the amount of zeros that you feel comfortable with the first thing that you can do if you want to make a million dollars you can sell something for a million dollars and as crazy as what I'm saying sounds you absolutely can sell something for a million dollars if you go to an e-commerce store and they're doing a hundred million dollars a year and you say hey if I can increase your conversion across your entire site rewrite your emails redo your landing pages and I can get you a five percent lift can I get one percent of that so you make them an extra five million a year and you get one do you think you can do that yes why are you gonna be able to do so much not because of you but because of who they are you make a million dollars by selling someone else five to ten million dollars of value and you're like I don't know how to do that that's fine but accept that you don't know how to do that and then say I want to learn how to do that and then go get this skill of doing that and then you can go sell it you can't say that you don't have the money and that's why you can't make money the second one is that you can borrow a million dollars and then buy something and have someone else pay it back it's fundamentally what real estate is you borrow money to buy an asset you put tenants into the asset they pay off the money that you never had that is what real estate is and I'll tell you a quick story on this so buddy of mine got into real estate was flipping houses didn't think there was a lot of money in it was like oh this sucks there's so much work and there's all those 10 you know so he ended up buying a 14 unit apartment building with someone else's money he didn't have any bought the apartment building and then sold it four months later for 500 000 more and you made 500 Grand in one transaction and so then he realized that the more expensive the building he sold the more money he made then he started getting into commercial real estate which is even more expensive he's like wait a second I can buy something for 10 million and then I can flip it to somebody for 13 and not even hold on to it for that long he started flipping 30 or 40 of these a year with just Him and a couple of va's number three is you refinance something for more than you bought it so if you're like but I don't know if they'll do that they will if it's priced low enough so if you have to go talk to a thousand building owners you will probably get one of them who's willing to depart for their thing for significantly less than its worth and a bank will loan the difference and you don't have to put any money down out of pocket let's say you have a hundred thousand dollar house and you get it under contract for eighty thousand dollars from them saying that they're willing to give you the house for eighty thousand dollars and then you say cool I can give you 70 and then you gotta seller finance me the 10 over the next five years and they say sure and now all of a sudden you just got to get the bank and the bank finance is eighty percent and now you actually just made the difference if you wanted to and you can take that number and you can do it at 100 million dollars you can do it at any of these levels but that's the concept does that make sense number four is that you get a contract for something for less than it's worth and then you sell that contract an option is a contract to say that you will be able to buy something at a future date at a price that is agreed upon today that's what an option is if I agree upon a price to somebody today then I as the person who's getting the option is hoping that it is worth more than that the first news selling the option is hoping that it's either worth less than that in the future or doesn't think it's going to change significantly it will just get paid for that tiny option for the contract itself let's say you've got a million dollar house now you call a bunch of houses you're going to be offering 20 below what the market rate is that you believe the houses were eventually you're going to get to somebody who's like you know what I've had this house for 30 years I bought it for ten dollars and now it's worth 800 Grand you know what I'll take the 800 Grand you think it's worth more than 800 and you say thank you I'm going to send you a DocuSign they sign the DocuSign that you have an option period to flip the house you could go to a real estate investor and say hey I have a house for nine hundred thousand dollars on sale right it's worth a million the guy says okay sure I'll sign for 900. this guy's gonna put 900 in you're going to pay 800 to this person and then you make the 100 in between and you put no money down the next one you can do is that you can sell something that's really expensive and get a commission sounds really simple you sell a skyscraper that's a 100 million dollar skyscraper you'll get three four percent of that deal three or four million dollars on a single transaction if you sell a 20 million residence and you might be like that's crazy they exist look on Zillow the realtor gets five-ish percent of the transaction that's a million dollars they never owned the asset the next one is that you can find somebody who has an audience buy whatever they're about to launch early and then sell it later now that one does take some money it's less but the the value of the thing later that's how it balloons this is how the entire nft thing worked is that you have tremendous demand for a scarce resource they have the scarce resource and then it balloons the price because there's so many people bidding against each other to get it and so getting in early on those types of things which is why if you buy into something pre-ipo it tends to almost always go up simply by the fact that there's way more eyeballs that are competing for most times the next one is selling units of stuff super simple but people don't do the math behind this I don't even like confining it to a year but you know we do live in time and so I will explain it that way if you wanted to make a million dollars you've got 52 weeks in a year about twenty thousand dollars a week is what you got to make 20 times 52 it's technically a million forty thousand for the internet trolls how many different ways can you make 20 grand in a week well you can sell 20 people a thousand dollar thing two people a ten thousand dollar thing one person every four weeks an eighty thousand dollar thing on a weekly basis 20 people who have a thousand dollar lifetime value for example if you have 100 a month membership and the person stays for 10 months on average then if you sell 20 of those every week over time those will stack up and then you will cap add a million dollars and the only way to grow from that new million is either you got to sell more units or you got to make the thing that you're selling worth more that's it the next one is that you can get people to give you their businesses for no money down good friend of mine actually did this and he combined four different information businesses into one business and they were all small businesses they were all doing about a millionish a year I get Small's relative but like and so he combined them all to be a four million dollar Top Line million and a half bottom line business for no money out of pocket he literally said hey I know you don't want to do this business anymore just give it to me and I'll pay you the income that you're going to make for this business for the next two years and they said sure and so you combined all those businesses together and then overnight he owned an asset that was doing a million and a half a year in profit and four million in Top Line and it cost him nothing to do it he owns the asset now and so if he turned around and went to say hey I'm gonna go sell this he could probably sell the thing for five million dollars put together it might cost him two million bucks and he makes the three he made more than a million dollars with no money out of pocket understand that the people who are making money don't constrain themselves by time they're not thinking how do I make X dollars per hour x dollars per year they're thinking how do I provide the most value to somebody so they'll give me a percentage of the value I provide here's another one is that you can go find stuff that you really like and go promote that so you don't have to go find and make your own products you go find products that you really like from other companies and just become Affiliates of those products and the nice thing is that I just recommend you be honest be like hey I tried 100 different soaps this is my favorite one and here's why people don't want to go through the time and the money of figuring out which soap is the best for your audience and if you make the rack after you do that they're like oh well shoot he just saved me time and so then I'll go buy from him through his link or whatever and so you can affiliate other people's products and make money in that way without any money out of pocket and then finally Arbitrage in general which is a fancy word but it just means that you sell the same thing between two different markets because they're priced differently if Bitcoin is nineteen thousand dollars in Japan on the Japanese Market is 19 100 in the US market you buy the nineteen thousand dollar Bitcoin over in Japan and you sell it in the American market for 1901 and you make a hundred bucks that's all Arbitrage is and it happens with physical products it happens with lending money between two parties if you can get money for one percent and you can sell the money for six percent you make five is the difference all of these are different versions of Arbitrage which is just same thing two markets two different prices you make the difference and so if you're looking for ways to make money look for Arbitrage opportunities because that's where you can make tremendous income\n"
