  "transcript": "you guys want to hear something absolutely insane I was able to take home more than a year than the CEOs of McDonald's Ikea Ford Motorola and Yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s and I have continued to for over half a decade which results in a $200 million pre-year portfolio and $100 million net worth by age 32 and no one is more surprised than me me expressing that fact will create Envy in some anger in others skepticism in most confusion in old people and Inspire select few you are who I made this presentation for but before I dive in raise your hand if you'd like any of the following things to happen to be able to charge two times five times 10 times more than your competition for the exact same thing like Yeti We have basically identical cups and somehow they're able to charge $40 versus $10 simply because of what on the cup if you'd like to be able to have customers buy from you over and over and over again without considering competition like Harley once you're a Harley guy you stay a Harley guy for life and if you'd like to virtually guarantee sales in any new business or product that you launch like apple a lot of people just weit and lie they say just leave my credit card just bill me and send whatever you're going to come out with and that's more or less how a lot of Apple buyers are once they become an apple person they become an apple person for life so if you like that stuff great because that's what this talk is about and so I couldn't figure out how these Brands these companies were able to do this demand these prices get people to stay loyal for a really long time and I felt like for me I always had to like big borrow and steal and I had to squeeze and push so hard just to get people to buy whereas these companies made it look effortless and it's because I didn't understand this one thing and that's the subject of the talk today brand and the thing is even people who claim to understand it often don't and the few who do understand it do a terrible job teaching it so this definitely is going to be marketing oneon-one class on branding presentation colors and logos and this definitely isn't going to be about feelings presence Intuition or whatever this is about making money and this concept that I'm going to explain to you is How I build a 7.8 million person audience across all these Platforms in the past 40 months or so I sold over a million copies of my last two books and your deals worth hundreds of million dollar in our holding Cy acquisition. that is why you build a brand or at least that's why I built mine and so today I'm going to cover three things number one what branding is you don't know what it is you certainly can't build one number two why it makes money because once you have it built you're like okay well how do I trade this thing for doll hairs which is what we want and then third how to start and grow yours so let's start with the first one what branding is so when I decided to build a brand I looked at what many popular marketers said about it here are some popular definitions that I have removed the marketers from them this is not throwing shade so I'm just saying them a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service or organization a brand is not what you say it is it's what they say it is a brand is a set of expectations memories stories and relations to that take it together account for a customer's decision to choose one product or service over another a brand is emotional shorthand for accumulated and assumed information a brand is present with the value of what the product service or personality means to its audience is greater than what it does for the audience a brand is a product service or concept that is publicly distinguished from other product services or concepts so it can be easily communicated and usually marketed branding is the process of creating and disseminating the brand name its qualities and personality the promotion of a particular product or Company by means of advertising and distinctive design if these sound vague and confusing it's because they are and I was just as confused as you when I was trying to figure this out because none of them told me what to do and so after looking at all these marketers words I think I pieced it together at least enough that once I started thinking about this way in a different way I'm about to share with you my brand grew and it grew fast and the reason this is so important is that if you don't know what to do nothing's going to change fundamentally if you don't change your behavior obviously nothing's going to change as result and so I want to Def find this one term before we get going learning who here came to learn raise your hands fantastic all other words just being talking to the wall so learning means same condition new behavior and so if I wanted to teach someone a phone script then after teaching you the phone rings again and you say the new script you learned learning occurred on the other hand if I tried to teach you the script and then the phone Rings again and then you change nothing no learning occurred you learned nothing and that's why none of this stuff that these guys said helped me because I didn't know what I could do I didn't know what Behavior I had to change as a result of this so I didn't know how to do it and so here's how branding happens branding is a deliberate pairing of things through an outcome so I'll say that again bring is a deliberate pairing of things through an out cup so let's use Coca-Cola drinking it and liking it as our example the Yum aka the outcome that's what people get they pair that with drinking the action so what they do to get it with Coca-Cola the product so the next time you want some yum you're probably going to reach for a Coca-Cola if that was paired for you successfully and so branding is a deliberate pairing of things through an outcome that's it but sometimes businesses pair stuff pair their stuff with things that people don't like that's bad branding this leads to losses for the business now some of you guys may have seen this this is Dylan mulany doing a collaboration with Bud Light there's a lot of press around this advertisement this advertisement was actually a great advertisement and you might might think I'm crazy but it was let me explain it's just not the way you might think it was this is a great advertisement because it let a lot of people know about their stuff it let a lot of people know about the product about Bud Light by the way if you're curious that is the definition of advertising not branding advertising is letting people know about your stuff branding is the pairing that occurs as a result so it was good advertising but bad branding many customers hated this pairing lots of people found out but a lot of people hated it good advertising bad branding and so as a result of this bad branding people not liking the pairing fewer people bought the product which netted a loss for the business and so to fix this budlight paired the product with stuff the audience liked like Shane Gillis who is a man's man comedian and the UFC a man's man of sports if you will and sales began to recover so that's the oneone explanation of branding let's go into 2011 so to go a little deeper because the better you get at this the more money you will make like the more Nuance you can understand how to brand and build a brand for yourself the more money you will make I promise you that and so to some people the dill m m pairing was actually good in general both good advertising and good branding hear me out for others it was bad obviously all pairings have positive and negative results and that's because everyone's different everyone has different preferences but for a business you can objectively see if a pairing was good or bad whether it netted you more money so more people disliked the Dyan tough date Dy M pairing so SES suffered making it a bad pairing so this isn't opinion they objectively made less money and so this pairing was a bad for their ideal audience now the 301 version of this is is there a company or a product where the D vany pairing could have been both good advertising and good branding so that the majority of people would have bought I think the answer is yes it just doesn't necessarily mean it's Bud Light for conservative males as the primary audience and on the other hand some people love the new Gillis and UFC pairings and some hated it but more of the audience that is their ideal customer liked it saw it as good and so the business netted sales a result and they made more money good branding and so for Budweiser and I just want to call this out this is specifically for Budweiser in their customer base it's not that Shen gillers so the UFC is Magic in some way or Dylan mulany is unmagic in some way but for that specific audience yes the pairing mattered and how much of the base liked it or disliked it so if you're anything like me making money is the point so let's drive this home if you made a pairing of your thing and your customer and you got to choose which outcome you had happen so you have your product and they drink it there's an outcome that happens afterwards right that pairs with it on one hand 75% like it and 25 hate it or on the other hand 25% like it and 75% hate it which would be the bottom example which would you choose more money good the big the big green one yes of course the top one because it would make you the most money and so to be clear for the 2011 level of understanding branding always happens branding always occurs but our goal is good branding and good branding is a deliberate pairing of our business with good outcomes for our ideal customers and so what you pair your business with determines two key things one who pays attention to your business and two whether they go towards your business like the UFC example or away from a business like the Del Mia example and so at the beginning of this I said I was going to cover three things the first thing I said is what is branding but now that we have gone through that I want to resay what I walked us through which is what good branding is ideally what we're shooting for so now that we covered that let's talk about why it makes you money why good branding makes you money branding as I toin it happens everywhere all the time but businesses use it for profit so let's look at some of the earliest uses of branding to figure out how we can use it so these are the first entrepreneurs who use branding to make money the earliest version of branding that we can think of or at least that I can think of happened on livestock it was literally a brand they would heat up metal they'd sear it into the side of a cattle and they would get a lovely little logo maybe we'll have a Nike Swoosh cow someday and so they literally burn these symbols into animals and those symbols had a magical effect so let's say you're walking around and you see a cow with no bread you say hello cow the cow says move back and it has nothing on it this is just a cow you might leave it alone and that might be it on the other hand let's say the cow has a bread you recognize say it's your neighbors you might be like hey that's Bill's cow now if you like Bill you might grab the cow and pull him by the whatever you pull cows by and probably return it to Bill if you hate bill then the cow may stay lost in the wilderness forever and become lunch for your family for the next month or two in the form of delicious burgers but either way For Better or For Worse the brand affected what you did it affected your behavior and so to take this to the 2011 level what if you see a branded cow but you don't recognize the brand you might be like who this I see a logo but I don't know anything about it well then you would treat it how you treat braided animals in general in that you just know that it belongs to someone and so you would treat it the way that you treat it as though it belong to anybody else and even if only a tiny bit you would treat a wild cow different from a branded cow in general so if you had one that was wild and you had one that you didn't recognize but was branded you would still probably treat them differently so that just shows you the power of brand as a concept because it dictates a tie between that c in a human being or some complex animal that can brand cow and so these are all effects of brand in general so that's how it affects what people do and so now I want to get tactical on how to get how we translate that concept into getting them to buy so let's say we pair our brand so this is where we get really tactial and this is like okay if you don't have a brand this is the step byep right now so you have a weak brand and we say it's a weak brand because it's starting up you don't have really a lot of Association fantastic so now you want to pair with people experiences other C other stuff that your ideal customer likes so in this instance I'm using little Nike pairing with LeBron and tiger who are Champions World Class goats Etc and so people who like sports and competition would see that probably as a positive pairing AKA good stuff and so if we do that pairing or we make that pairing for the majority of people braining will occur and so the brand grows and so the question then follows what's the benefit of a strong brand versus a weak brand and so the the the weak brand is before the pairing the stronger brand is after the pairing so a strong brand turns commoditized products like a $5 white T-shirt plus the strong brand into a premium product a higher value brand name product and preium products with a strong brand then get customers to want to pair themselves with the product so that they can associate the outcome themselves with the outcome the brand delivers which they do with their money so how do they make that Association they give money they get the shirt the association happens based on what they've seen where that logo has been elsewhere and so then they go from I want to be a winner to exchanging money and saying now I am a winner or I feel like a winner that's how this works and so this means that if the ideal customer likees boards winning and competition Etc then they're more likely to buy stuff from a brand paired with those things so let's lay it all out weak brand paired with stuff customers like creates a strong brand strong brand gets put onto a winning product transforms a generic to winning product then the customers want to associate with that winning product so they buy the product and they put money into your bank account in order to do it and so as long as you net a positive between what it cost you to associate with tiger and LeBron and how many t-shirts you can sell a result you make money and so here are some steps in words for those of you who are more word people you start with a brand that means nothing you have a logo just like the cow that the other person didn't recognize people know that it is a brand they just don't know what that brand means yet so it means nothing right now then you pair that brand with something or someone that your customers ideally like third your brand starts to mean the thing customer likes to them then they want to associate themselves with that thing they like or get more of it but they can't buy that thing but they can buy a tiny sliver of that Association so they buy the shirt with the logo that means that thing to them and so they get the shirt you get the money and it all happened because you deliberately paired it with something they like and this happens everywhere so DOL and gabana classic example they paired with Kim Kardashian they made a line specifically for her and so for a lady who wants to associate with Fame Beauty wealth that would be a pairing that makes sense and so that lady who wants other people to associate her with Fame high class money luxury wealth will then buy DOL and gabana and be like I'm just like him now she might not say that directly because she might just associate with the values but the transfer still happens and so when someone looks at two products that on the surface are generically the same you've got two T-shirts one that has a weak brand or no brand and the other that has the strong brand the person that has the strong brand they're going to be more likely to buy and pay more for and this happens because they actually buy the elements that we've deliberately paired with the brand which they identify with and at this point of building a brand you do this to change customer behavior and that excuse me that is the point of building a brand to change customer Behavior in your favor when they see it with a product and so this is a quote from warff that I like a lot kind of signifying some of the elements of the benefits of brand is that the single most important decision in evaluating business is pricing power if you've got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor you've got a very good business and if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10% then you've got a terrible business and so if we have an unbred t-shirt for $5 and we say you know what we think we have a strong enough brand that we can raise the price and then boom we can raise the price and still not lose that many sales but we in this case 12x the price good branding drives that premium pricing good branding also improves advertising so with the generic brand if you're marketing this white T-shirt you might get half a percent of people there are many white t-shirts there are many like it this one is mine just kidding so the point for those of you got the reference um so if you have a 05% cluther rate on some that's generic there's nothing special about it on the flip side if you have a Nike bread t-shirt same identical t-shirt and it has the swoosh now you might get six times as many people to click and buy at a higher price see how these things stack together that is why these Brands exist for such a long period of time and make so much money so they get cheaper customers they get higher returns and they have better response rates and advertising and on top of that if if as if that weren't enough good branding ALS what drives Customer Loyalty AKA they buy more stuff more times and so like the Apple example I gave earlier once you buy one Apple product you tend to buy more and you tend to keep buying them and so this also a good brand also protects your business from competitors stealing that customer in the future and so as I promised in the beginning who's seeing how this all this stuff allows you to one be able to charge 10 times or more than your competition two get higher returns and advertising so you can scale that much more that much faster and then three get people to keep buying for Life compounding your money making skills for good okay which is why building a brand will make you lots of money it's also why Brands outperform Commodities in every single industry and give a lasting competitive advantage that to be fair is Theirs to lose so here's another quote from Uncle warrant it takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it if you think about that you'll do things differently and so so I said that I was going to cover three things one what branding is which we renamed what good branding is second why it makes you money then we got that so now let's go to how to start or grow your own brand so branding is the deliberate pairing of things your thing plus what your ideal customer has through an outcome and good branding is the Del paing of your thing with something good to start a brand we have to know what we want to pair it with to attract ideal customers so here we've got light UFC good outcome for the majority of the audience and we want to understand that just as much as we should also understand which to avoid pairing our brand with to lose customers like the D Mia example and so here's how I like to think about assembling the pairings for a brand so if you're at Ground Zero you have you have no brand you've got these elements that haven't been put together yet so I think about it like a table full of flowers so if you want to put it bouquet together you start by having lots of different flowers all over the place on their own those flowers are not a bouquet just as products values experiences people Etc on their own are not a brand the flowers are like the brand elements that we pair with stuff or audiences like with enough pairing over and over and over again they form a bouquet now replace the word bouquet with brand and so that assembly is the connection it's the association between those things because the brand fundamentally doesn't actually exist if I take the flowers out of the vase and scatter them across was there ever a brand to begin with it's simply the association we make between those things that creates the oneof one brand and if we unravel it the brand disappears and so the deliberate pairing of those things makes the brand and if we want to get narrower on our brand so let's say I talk about tacos lifting and philosophy if I want to narrow my brand I'll just talk a bunch about tacos and then all of my flowers are just Taco related if I'm only talking about tacos but I want to expand the stuff I'm talking about to my audience and maybe capture a wider audience then I might talk about tacos quesadillas burritos things that are tangential and then if I wanted to expand even broader I might just talk about food in general and then I might talk in alcohol then I might talk in restaurants and then things that go wider and wider from there and so we get narrower as we Niche down and we go double down on one type of topic and we go broader when we Branch out but distant and random pairings hurt a brand because they're so hard to make the associations with and this is what most brands are and do most people's Brands happen by accident it's just whatever they appear next to whatever people associate their stuff with good branding happens on purpose because like what are we looking at with a a bike a single flow some socks and a burger not a lot not a lot to hold together there and so think about it like curating a garden you want some flowers to grow and you want to pull out the weeds you have to do both you have to add the good and take away the bad in order to assemble the ideal brand for you and in the beginning our brand won't be strong just like yours one if you're building it then you might only have a couple flowers there and it's because you have haven't had that many instances to pair your brand for that customer but the more good stuff we pair with our brand for the customer the stronger it gets you go from one flower to many red flowers or many red roses that become a bouquet of red roses that's what you're about and the more you're about it the more the brand strengthens now what if we make a branding mistake and pair with the wrong thing cuz it's going to happen one bet pairing can absolutely hurt a brand so if I now give my this lovely red rose uh bouquet to my wife and I say hey don't you love this bouquet and she sees this rotten flower sticking out the front she might be like e this bouquet sucks or this brand sucks or hey that guy got a DUI and I thought he was this Paramount of good ethics well that would hurt the brain and so just like one ugly flower messes up the whole bouquet it changes how everyone sees the Brand This bouquet sucks now to recover from something like that you just have to overwhelm customers with the stuff they like until eventually the bad pairing shrinks into irrelevance so we don't try and eliminate the DUI we don't try and eliminate the dead row it happened there's nothing we can do about it but what we try to do is just overwhelm it with way more of the stuff that the majority of our people actually like and so Kanye for example has said some things that people don't like but he also comes out with products that people love he made a Super Bowl ad he sold shoes he just came out with an album that came out after having some cancel culture stuff around him and things he had said and so over time people forgot the bad stuff and Associated the good stuff back with him and purchased they still bought and so you need to decide what values people experien Etc that you want to use to connect the audience to your product and equally importantly what things you want to avoid remove or ignore from the stuff they hate and so it goes without saying that even if you say you're premium but people think your thing sucks that suck will stick and so up to this point everything I've talked about has been the things external to the product they've been the people you associate the product with now almost all of that occurs prior to purchase so you can absolutely get someone to buy the thing but how many experiences are people are going to have with the thing once they've purchased it probably far more than they have with your advertisement and so the advertisement can let people know about it The Branding makes a good Association for the person they make the purchase and then afterwards the product does a lot of The Branding after that because if I buy that amazing Nike t-shirt and there's a hole in the armpit when it comes in I might say if this is the first time I ever bought a Nike product this product sucks therefore Nike sucks and then I think the whole thing is a sham and then I also start to hate LeBron for even recommending right starts to transfer backwards now on the flip side brand can influence how people see the product so if the product is what I would call good enough so it's it doesn't have any holes in it now is it the highest quality it possibly could be maybe not but it's good enough that no one's going to find an immediate problem with the product that's where brand can carry you the extra distance to still make it a positive experience for the person and so brand in a very real way can affect how people perceive value through products now me personally this a pro tip here if I'm going to charge a premium price I absolutely want to make sure that the product is dialed so that I only further reinforce how much they like my brand rather than let my brand carry me or at worst have it conflict with the impression that I gave them of the thing they were going to buy prior to them buying it this is a quote from Warren your premium brand had better be delivering something special or it's not going to get the business and the only tweak I'd have on this is it it's not going to keep the business you'll get the first purchase you just won't get the ones after that and so all the things are like okay got it so brand is pairing I get how the pairing makes me money I have these big margins I got more ctrs more people buy and as long as my thing doesn't suck and ideally that it's good people will keep buying awesome but how do I measure that so braad has three main metrics one which is influence which is How likely it is to change someone's Behavior so if I show someone a brand and they react in any way they recognize it and they they they do something about it then we have influence second is direction are they changing the way we wanted or are they running away and third how many people it changes for that's it so if I show room up 100 people and 100 people react versus two people react the 100 person reacting at least recognition that is the reach how many people it changes it for so taking to the hypothetical extreme a small weak and neutral brand very few people recognize and the people that do don't care that much about it either way and on the other polar extreme you have a large large strong positive brand so that would be lots of people recognize the brand it changes Behavior when they see the brand and the behavior is generally towards so they try do in accordance with what that brand is asking someone to do and I want to make this point a lot of people have this misn that any strong brand is polar that because lots of people love it lots of people Al have to ha it now I say this by percentage not necessarily by absolute if you have if the whole United States knows who you are you're going to have a percentage of people that hate you just because there's crazy people and that's how we're talking about I'm saying is there a brand that can't have that kind of status that isn't polar so I'll give a polar example first so I have the silhouette of Donald Trump here and he has a very strong brand he has a big reach lots of people recognize him even just the silhouette alone people recognize he a strong influence as in the percentage of people that when they see this have a reaction in either direction positive or negative but just that they react shows that he has strong influence and then third is the direction now for him he is polar meaning many people move towards him very strongly and many people move away from him very strongly and so many assume that all brands are that way and that's just because there are many examples of that but that doesn't mean it has to be that way and so I'll give you a different example so some Brands manage to change change many people's behavior towards them all at once and so like Taylor Swift sure I'm sure she's got some crazies don't get me wrong but the vast majority of people who see Taylor Swift recognize her she changed their behavior and most of the time it's towards her so she is a large positive strong brand this is also personally why I think the idea of like seeking out controversy absolutely gets you recognized but you don't have to make that trade you can't absolutely just build a strong positive brand Mother Teresa has a strong positive brand a lot of people know her influenced a lot of behavior did a lot of good stuff must be work like I hate Mother Teresa some people do but most people don't and the same thing goes with apple a lot of people like their products I'm sure there are some techs that are like Android's way better right they're like PC is awesome and that's great that's good for them but the vast majority of people who encounter the product like it which is why they're one of the largest companies in the world so all those examples that I gave to you up to this point have a assumed a large audience and I do that because this is a pration and it makes more sense for me to work with you on stuff that you already know but this concept carries independent of whether you have large reach and this is why it applies to you so if you had a small audience with high influence what would you have got Mom and Dad they are high influence as in most people when they see their parents their behavior changes they have low reach because for you they're only your parents they might have any they might be some other people's parents but not very many people's parents as you have low reach um and it will be your behavior will towards for some and a way for others meaning some people hate their parents and don't want to do anything they say and some people like their parents and do whatever they say and there's a lot of people in between and so that's how we measure if what we're doing to grow our brand is actually working are more people finding out about it are more people changing their behavior when they do it and ideally are they doing that towards the direction that we want them to go so if I say hey everybody go click here go download this thing go attend this event go buy this product whatever it is if a lot of people do that then we know that the brand is growing and so we want when we want to build our brand we want to pair our stuff with the things the highest percentage of our ideal audience like and so whenever we pair anything with a brand because especially if you're starting out everything is new and so every new pairing has risk and so you risk losing a certain percentage of your audience who has a bad experience with the thing you pair there's always that risk there's always going to be some people who don't like something you do if anyone seen a small town band go hit it big some of the old Towners are like oh they sold out they did whatever but what they did was they gambled the short-term loss of that local audience potentially for a much broader bigger audience so they made a bet they did lose people they did gain people they just gained more than they lost and so to the same degree when you make that bet as the local band you risk gaining other people who have had a positive experience with this new thing and ideally we have more green than red and so those news pairings the new pairings you make with a brand always lose audience right he's sold out I like the old stuff better this also happens with content by the way and so this person is the red bucket fantastic and the new stuff might also cause people to say no this new stuff rocks and that person is in the green bucket and so whenever you try to grow and you make any new pairing meaning you make new content you make a new genre you make a new song you make a new anything you make a bet that more people for where ideal audience will like the pairing than people who don't tldr that you'll net an increase in reach influence and positive direction and so my ask for here is don't let the five mean comments stop you from Gaining the 500 new people who like the new thing so let me finish the real life example to make this whole thing real for you I want to associate myself with business value so I associate self with making people money and growing their businesses so there's me there's me making content and then ideally money and so the best way I can do this is make content for the small business owner to consume and books for them to read and use so that they then profit the good thing and then they associate that growth and profit with me and so then they consume more of my stuff they drink the next soda they buy the next shirt and so the next time they want it to happen again they take the action or they have a higher likelihood of taking the desired action and equally important people who don't like business stuff won't like my stuff or they'll just prefer to watch other things so you've got this married couple they say we hate people who talk about money they're probably not going to like my stuff and that's okay but people who like business have a business or trying to start one might want more and this grows the brand because people consume the stuff and they say hey you got to check out herzi stuff and then that person they tell to says right on they J it out they get that positive outcome they make the pairing as well and the brand grows and ideally with my ideal audience and so to see this in action if you use this information from today to make money good branding has occurred and so I said I was going to cover three things what branding is IDE what good braiding is why it makes you money and how to start and grow yours so hopefully you feel like I fulfilled those three things and so now we can test if the pairing good branding actually occurred so if you are my ideal customer so here's a business owner okay awesome a lot of you fantastic we can see objectively if this provided value did we get a good positive outcome a neutral outcome or a negative one you might be like I hate this guy talk about money or you know what I think this could make me a ton of money well we'll
