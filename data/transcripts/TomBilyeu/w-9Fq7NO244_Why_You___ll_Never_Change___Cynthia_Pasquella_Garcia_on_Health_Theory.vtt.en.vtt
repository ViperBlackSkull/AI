00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:25.630 align:start position:0%
and all of those things right we'd be

and all of those things right we'd be

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.410 align:start position:0%
done so it was clear to me that it was
 

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.010 align:start position:0%

00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:35.019 align:start position:0%
do it one of the things that I looked at
 

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:37.499 align:start position:0%
do it one of the things that I looked at

why don't we think we're worthy because
