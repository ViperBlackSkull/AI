00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
end up in different places
 

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.110 align:start position:0%
end up in different places
then<00:20:27.120><c> we</c><00:20:27.280><c> know</c><00:20:27.600><c> okay</c><00:20:28.480><c> at</c><00:20:28.559><c> least</c><00:20:28.799><c> we</c><00:20:28.960><c> can</c>
