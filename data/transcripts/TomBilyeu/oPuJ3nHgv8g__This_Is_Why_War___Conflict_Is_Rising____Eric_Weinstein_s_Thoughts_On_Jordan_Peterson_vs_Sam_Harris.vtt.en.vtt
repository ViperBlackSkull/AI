00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
is<00:14:06.720><c> all</c><00:14:06.880><c> right</c><00:14:07.079><c> like</c><00:14:07.240><c> I</c><00:14:07.320><c> said</c><00:14:07.480><c> I</c><00:14:07.600><c> make</c><00:14:07.759><c> no</c>

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
is all right like I said I make no
 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.470 align:start position:0%

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.949 align:start position:0%

if<00:14:10.560><c> we</c><00:14:10.680><c> have</c><00:14:10.839><c> just</c><00:14:11.000><c> one</c><00:14:11.199><c> string</c><00:14:11.600><c> we</c><00:14:11.720><c> can</c>

if we have just one string we can
 

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.389 align:start position:0%
if we have just one string we can
probably<00:14:12.320><c> figure</c><00:14:12.600><c> out</c>

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
probably figure out
 

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:15.430 align:start position:0%
probably figure out
something<00:14:14.399><c> all</c><00:14:14.519><c> right</c><00:14:14.639><c> so</c><00:14:14.800><c> first</c><00:14:15.120><c> what's</c><00:14:15.279><c> the</c>

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
something all right so first what's the
 

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.990 align:start position:0%
something all right so first what's the
impurity<00:14:15.920><c> this</c><00:14:16.040><c> is</c><00:14:16.199><c> based</c><00:14:16.440><c> on</c>

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
impurity this is based on
 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.670 align:start position:0%
impurity this is based on
well<00:14:20.079><c> so</c><00:14:21.079><c> if</c><00:14:21.199><c> you</c><00:14:21.360><c> break</c><00:14:21.680><c> the</c><00:14:21.880><c> string</c><00:14:22.399><c> into</c>

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
well so if you break the string into
 

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.069 align:start position:0%
well so if you break the string into
three<00:14:23.120><c> pieces</c><00:14:24.120><c> so</c><00:14:24.360><c> this</c><00:14:24.440><c> would</c><00:14:24.639><c> be</c><00:14:25.440><c> your</c><00:14:25.680><c> E</c>

00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
three pieces so this would be your E
 

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:28.829 align:start position:0%
three pieces so this would be your E
string<00:14:27.079><c> but</c><00:14:27.199><c> if</c><00:14:27.320><c> I</c><00:14:27.480><c> place</c><00:14:27.720><c> my</c><00:14:27.880><c> finger</c><00:14:28.480><c> exactly</c>

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%

00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
