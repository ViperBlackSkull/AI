00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.100
Eric: What you see consistently in terms of
bad behavior and good behavior?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.389
There's a lot of research that frames it in
terms of time, a short-term strategy versus

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.629
a long-term strategy.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.539
Tom: It's actually a really good point.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.630
Eric: If you think about it, in general, what's
the reputation of used car salesman?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.630
Not very good.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.630
Why?

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.400
They are probably never going to see you again,
very short-term, versus what's the general

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400
reputation of moms?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.470
Moms are going to be with you throughout the
rest of your life.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.890
It's a longer [00:00:30] term type of strategy.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.699
When you look at these kinds of things, that's
where all of a sudden the bad and good behavior

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.420
starts to make a little bit more sense.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.750
Tom: Everybody, welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.789
You are here my friends because you believe
that human potential is nearly limitless,

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.379
but you know that having potential is not
the same as actually doing something with

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.379
it.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.270
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.350
will help you actually execute on your dreams.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.540
[00:01:00] Today's guest is a reformed screenwriter
who traded in his tenure a luminary studio

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.870
such as Disney and Fox to pursue his passion
for fact-finding, which he turned into one

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.160
of the most popular blogs in the internet.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.640
Over the past eight years, his humorous and
wildly informative articles have garnered

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.180
him massive attention and help him amass an
army of dedicated followers numbering over

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.990
300,000 strong and I am not the least bit
surprised.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.780
His content is aimed at providing readers
with [00:01:30] science-based answers and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.770
expert insights in how to be in his words,
awesome at life, and he certainly delivers.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.530
I was so captivated by his debut book, Barking
Up the Wrong Tree: The Surprising Science

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.880
Behind Why Everything You Know About Success
Is (Mostly) Wrong, that we had him scheduled

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.210
on the show before I've even finished reading
it.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.340
His work challenges many of the long-held
platitudes about what makes people successful

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.200
and reveals the real usable secrets to success.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.480
They are often surprising.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.909
At times, a little unnerving if I'm completely
honest, [00:02:00] but always useful and his

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.670
insatiable curiosity and wondrous ability
to succinctly summarize often hard to digest

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.490
data has made one of the most sought after
speaker educators working today.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.880
He has been invited to speak at such prestigious
institutions as West Point, Yale, and MIT

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.250
and his writing has been featured everywhere
from the New York Times to the Wall Street

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.340
Journal and prestigious publications such
as Time Magazine and Business Insider regularly

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.890
syndicate his content.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.560
He is quite literally redefining the rules
of success.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.380
[00:02:30] Please my friends, help me in welcoming
the best-selling author whose book was selected

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.380
as The Financial Times' business book of the
month, the creator of bakadesuyo.com, which

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.360
in Japanese ironically translates both as,
"I am Barker and I am an idiot."

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.560
The insightful, funny, and decidedly not idiotic,
Eric Barker.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.540
Eric: Great to be here.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.530
Tom: Good to have you.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.110
I have to say [00:03:00] I love that after
learning what ... How do you pronounce it

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.110
by the way?

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.110
That was my best.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.110
Eric: Bakadesuyo.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.990
Tom: Once you learned that that translates
into I am Barker and I am an idiot that you

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.430
still made it your URL.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.800
Eric: First day of Japanese class, I found
out my last name means idiot in Japanese.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.220
Watashi wa baka desu means I am Barker.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.819
Watashi wa baka desu means I am an idiot.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.990
I've never had a Japanese person forget my
name.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.620
In fact, they seem to love saying it.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.740
Tom: That is hilarious. [00:03:30] What made
you take Japanese in the first place, which

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.740
doesn't sound easy?

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.570
Eric: I want to do something different.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.920
I wanted to try something that was really
out there and just so different and having

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.069
three character systems and just something
that existed like in parallel rather than

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.069
Latin-based romance language and just really
see what I can learn there.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.750
It was a lot of fun, but it wasn't easy.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.100
Tom: Was this in high school or college?

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.239
Eric: This was college.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.610
It was challenging, [00:04:00] but it was
really interesting because from a language

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.810
you also learn a little bit about the culture
and you learn so much.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.810
It's really fun.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.590
I'm glad I chose it even though it made studying
a little harder.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.590
Tom: I can imagine.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.390
I actually really like how well that personality
trait of you of not looking for the easy path,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.070
of always being willing to look underneath
the hood and then embrace what you find whether

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.990
it's what your last name means or one of the
most interesting things it was in your book

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.080
is the concept [00:04:30] that feeling powerless
at work can actually kill you I think is the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.910
exact quote from your book.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.910
Tell us about that.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.740
Eric: There's plenty of research that shows
that stress in small amounts can be a performance

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.880
enhancer.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.190
When you're feeling groggy, when you're feeling
tired, you're not 100%, a little bit of stress

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.190
is good.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.750
A lot of stress, especially a lot of stress
over a long period of time, we all know this

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.530
isn't good and when you feel powerless at
work, when you feel like you don't have [00:05:00]

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.300
autonomy, when you feel like nobody is listening
to you, don't feel respected, stress level

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.000
or cortisol levels go up.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.770
Over a period of time, not in a day or week,
but over period of years, feeling like what

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.000
you do doesn't make a difference and feeling
like you're not respected.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.950
Having stress levels elevated like that, what
you see is over time, years, decades, people

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.150
are much more likely to have garner incidents.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.150
Tom: It's so interesting.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.960
It was one of the things in the book that
as you are detailing, I'm like, "That actually

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.430
make sense, but having such [00:05:30] a fine
point on it."

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.229
I found really, really surprising.

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.710
You've been doing this blog for eight years,
started as a blog, Barking Up the Wrong Tree,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.770
evolves into the book that it now is.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.960
In all of that research, which by the way
for anybody discovering him for the first

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.889
time right now, you're going to love how thoroughly
he researches all the stuff and the fact that

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.020
the book is about how the things you've been
taught about success are mostly wrong I think

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.370
really comes from the fact that you encounter
these platitudes and as you dig deeper [00:06:00]

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.139
realized that they just don't hold up to the
scrutiny of the data.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.150
What have you found most surprising in the
data?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.199
Eric: One of the things that was most surprising
to me was Adam Grant's research in terms of

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.389
nice guys finish last.

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.850
Adam teaches at Wharton and Adam is a very
nice guy himself.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.020
He split it up into givers, matchers, and
takers as the three groups he made.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.070
Givers are people who give altruistically,
love helping people.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.380
Matchers are people who strongly believe in
fairness so they try to keep an even balance

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.791
and give and take.

00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.152
Takers are people who want to get as much
as possible and give as [00:06:30] little

00:06:30.152 --> 00:06:31.380
as possible.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.540
Adam looked at a bunch of careers and he looked
at a variety of success metrics.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.610
The initial results didn't make a nice guy
like Adam feel very good because the initial

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.020
results showed a disproportionate number of
nice guys showing up at the bottom of success

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.990
metrics across a number of fields.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.780
This is a little depressing.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.419
When he did the thorough analysis, what he
found out the results were actually bimodal.

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.680
It was basically a disproportionate number
of nice guys were at the bottom, a disproportionate

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.630
number of nice guys at the top.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.750
That might sound initially confusing, [00:07:00]
but really I think it's something we can all

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:08.391
relate to because we all know a martyr who
gets taken advantage of, gets walked on, does

00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.660
too much for others, doesn't do enough for
themselves and gets exploited.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.180
We also know people who are really awesome,
really great, go out of their way to help

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.530
others, everybody feels indebted to them,
everybody loves them and everybody is so happy

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.340
to go out of their way to support that person
and to do whatever they can.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.650
It's not an issue of nice being bad or nice
being weak.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.340
It's just an issue of how you handle [00:07:30]
that balance of wanting to give to others

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.520
and doing it while not being a doormat, while
not getting exploited.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.430
Tom: One of the things that you detailed along
those lines is the computer programs, the

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.960
algorithms that they had compete.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.509
Talk to us about TFT, what that is.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.680
I found this really interesting.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.210
It resonated with me a lot.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.860
Eric: This was the research by Robert Axelrod
that basically during the prisoner's dilemma,

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.920
which is a standard thing where are you going
to work with the other person or are you going

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.080
to [00:08:00] defect to try and cheat them.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.750
He reached out to a lot of different experts
in math and sociology and wherever to come

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.750
up with an algorithm.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.070
Tom: Let's go into more detail about the process.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:21.340
It's something like you're being interrogated
and there's two of you that are in the crime.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.360
If you say nothing, you get one year?

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.759
Eric: Basically, you both went to bank robbery,
[00:08:30] you both get arrested.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:33.190
You are being interrogated in separate rooms.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:42.570
If you both say nothing, then you both get
like one year in prison.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:51.570
If you defect, if you basically say, "He did
it", then you do better, he does worst.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:57.500
If you both turn the other guy in, then you
both do pretty bad.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.830
If you could coordinate with the other person,
[00:09:00] but you can't.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.330
If you could coordinate, you could both keep
your mouth shut.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:09.160
The question there becomes, what's the optimal
way mathematically speaking?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.810
What's the optimal way to negotiate the prisoner's
dilemma.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.520
They had a bunch of different algorithms that
would try different things.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.980
You had some that were like always nice.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.910
They always cooperated.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.910
They never betrayed the other person no matter
what because it is multiple rounds.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.730
Then, you have ones that always try to screw
the other guy [00:09:30] no matter what.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.680
Then, you had sneakier ones that would like,
"See, hey, on this round, can I cheat a little

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.680
bit and then back pedal?

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.040
How much can I get away with?"

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.630
Tom: Those are meant to replicate the givers,
matchers, and takers?

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.430
Eric: Axelrod did this research like in the
'80s.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.600
This was around the time the Cold War because
they were trying to figure out was there some

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.660
way the US and Russia could cooperate.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.210
What was the optimal way?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.279
What they basically found was comically, all
these complex algorithms [00:10:00] and the

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:05.310
one that by far did the best was something
we all learned when we're kids.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.190
It was Tit For Tat.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.110
Basically, it was, "Okay, we go one round.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.220
I'm going to start off cooperating.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.250
If you cooperate, the next round I'll cooperate.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.950
If you defect, next round I defect and I will
have no memory, so all I'm looking at is the

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:21.950
last round.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.730
If you defect, fine, then I'll defect.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.089
If you cooperate, then I'll join you again,
just tit for tat.

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:30.060
I'm going to start out cooperating, then I'm
going to do whatever you did in the last round."

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.810
[00:10:30] Tit for tat destroyed everybody.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.670
What was interesting was initially tit for
tat would lose.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.800
The bad guys will get the high ground very
quickly because they were immediately attacking,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.040
but over time, tit for tat had some great
things going forward in the sense that, first,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.520
it always initially cooperated.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.950
It showed good will.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.100
Pass that, it wasn't a doormat.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.250
If you defected, it would defect right back.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.880
It had that balance of, "Hey, I'm going to
show good will, but I'm not going to take

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880
any [00:11:00] crap."

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.420
The really thing I think we can really take
away from that's valuable is it also educated

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:12.220
the other person in how to play as opposed
to punishing.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.269
There were other algorithms that would start
off cooperating and we all know people like

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:18.269
this.

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:20.279
Start off cooperating and the minute you defected,
"That's it.

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.250
I'm never going to trust you again, defect,
defect, defect, defect.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.720
I don't care what you do.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.920
I don't trust you now."

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.779
This was a kind of an educational process.

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.370
If you [00:11:30] think, it make sense.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.970
It maps on to longer term negotiations.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.470
If you know you're going to have to deal with
somebody over a longer period of time, this

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.500
educational process where, "Okay, you're going
too far."

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.080
We are teaching each other how to talk to
one another.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.760
"If you cooperate, I'll be defecting.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760
I'm going to defect back.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760
You're going to cooperate now?

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.019
Okay, I'm going to cooperate now."

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.450
There was ongoing conversation.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:55.970
In a short-term, the bad guys took the high
ground, but the long-term, very often whenever

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:01.279
tit for tat would meet another good program,
the gains [00:12:00] were exponential.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:05.970
When I met a bad program, I was going to take
any crap, so the loses were small and the

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.040
programs that were in the middle, it managed
to teach them, "Hey, if you're going to screw

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.730
me over, I'm going to screw you back.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.730
If you're good, I'll be good."

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.520
They realized being good was in their best
interest.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.800
Tom: One of the funniest parts of your book
is where you go into like this long like page

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:29.610
after page after page [inaudible 00:12:23]
all the ways that being nice can be punished.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.899
You finally [00:12:30] ended by saying, "I
would keep going, but my publisher won't let

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:36.100
me release this with antidepressants."

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.899
Talk to us about that early lead the jerks
can get and how does that play out like in

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:43.370
a concrete business environment.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.290
Eric: Very often, bad traits.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.010
What you see consistently in terms of bad
behavior and good behavior?

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:57.279
There's a lot of research that frames it in
terms of time, a short-term strategy versus

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.519
a long-term strategy.

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:00.240
Tom: It's actually a really good point.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.200
Eric: [00:13:00] If you think about it, in
general, what's the reputation of used car

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200
salesman?

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.200
Not very good.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200
Why?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.959
They are probably never going to see you again,
very short-term.

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:15.540
If we map that on the prisoner's dilemma,
if there's only one or two rounds, I get the

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.140
high ground, I can just win.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.430
You're not going to get a chance to retaliate.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.779
Versus, what's the general reputation of moms?

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:24.880
Mom is going to be with you throughout the
rest of your life.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.970
Mom is going to take care.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:27.970
Mom is going to be there.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.500
It's a longer term type of strategy.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.370
[00:13:30] When you look at these kind of
things, that's where all of a sudden the bad

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.890
and good behavior starts to make a little
bit more sense.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.050
Initially, you look at narcissists.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.060
Narcissist do better in job interviews.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.460
They do better on first dates and initially,
these things look really good, but by the

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.260
same token, if you go a few weeks in to starting
a job, narcissists are generally regarded

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.260
as untrustworthy.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.180
After a few months of relationship, relationship
satisfaction of the other partner tanks.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.139
It's this shorter term strategy, [00:14:00]
grab all I can.

00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:07.700
One of the strategies that people can use
for take away from this is that if you find

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:13.610
yourself and then you are involved and encounter
a deal or whatever with somebody who you are

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.660
not so sure if you can trust them.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.571
They call it lengthening the shadow of the
future.

00:14:17.571 --> 00:14:24.210
If I build more steps into the contract, if
I stretch this out, if they know there's going

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:30.420
to be a chance for retaliation, there's going
to be a chance for renegotiation, then people

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.779
[00:14:30] behave better because they know
they have to.

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.160
How do people behave?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.389
If you meet somebody off the street, that's
one thing.

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:43.190
If you are introduced to someone by mutual
friend, probably they're a little bit nicer.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.050
You don't want your friend to get upset with
you.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:52.610
Very often in this kind of one off type encounters,
bad behavior can payoff.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.470
It's sad.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.459
When it's stretched out, very often there's
a chance for retaliation and more importantly,

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:01.170
we develop a [00:15:00] reputation.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.630
People talk.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.850
There's gossip.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.810
If you develop a reputation or people say
you can trust this person, over time that

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.820
benefits us.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.010
If somebody says, "Yeah, they seem really
nice.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.339
They're a fast talker, but don't trust them,"
that comes back to haunt them.

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:18.621
Tom: You talk really well in the book about
how one of the most dangerous places for a

00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:23.570
giver is to be in an organization full of
takers because there's no other givers there

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.959
to protect you and create a buffer.

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:29.900
What advice would you give if you had a friend
who is a giver in the midst of a bunch [00:15:30]

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.750
of takers and they can't leave for whatever
reason?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.750
Financially, they're trapped.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.860
They are just right now they can't afford
to leave the job.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:42.630
Would you advise to adopt taker strategies
or would you give other advice?

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:48.880
Eric: If they can't leave then, what you get
from Robert Axelrod's research was that because

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:56.199
they tried it where they had multiple games
going on, circle the wagons is what I would

00:15:56.199 --> 00:16:02.970
say, is find a few givers or few matchers
that are [00:16:00] there and affiliate tightly

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.110
with them and work through them and with them.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.680
Obviously, being surrounded by takers, especially
when your natural instinct is to be a giver

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.709
is really dangerous.

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:13.930
Number one, you can get exploited.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.149
Number two, over time, you can become a taker
yourself.

00:16:17.149 --> 00:16:21.680
Robert Sutton who is a professor at Stanford
gave some great advice where he said, "Whenever

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.490
you interviewed a company, look around at
the people at that company because you're

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.910
going to become like them.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.150
They're not going to become like you."

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.230
Tom: I love that.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.880
Eric: We always talk [00:16:30] about peer
pressure in relation to teenagers.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.940
Peer pressure affects us our entire lives.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.420
We are always influenced by our context and
by the people around us.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.080
The biggest danger there is we don't realize
it.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.950
We are always influenced.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.491
The thing that givers need to keep in mind
is that if they find other givers, boom, they're

00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:54.250
helping each other, their favors, and they're
both on the lookout for being exploited.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.760
Matchers can also be valuable as well because
matchers it's not merely that they want to

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.800
keep a balance or give and [00:17:00] take.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.980
Matchers typically have a strong belief in
justice.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:10.429
Matchers are very happy to punish takers and
to reward givers.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.720
With other givers, givers can do very well.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.279
They can produce great things at work.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:20.489
If givers managed to surround themselves with
matchers, then they end up with bodyguards.

00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:24.240
It's basically seek out those people and circle
the wagons as best you can.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.409
Tom: Do you think that applies in like interpersonal
relationships outside of work?

00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:32.149
When you are thinking about looking [00:17:30]
for a spouse, is that something to take into

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:33.149
consideration?

00:17:33.149 --> 00:17:37.570
Eric: I think it's something to take into
consideration in every area of life.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.029
At work, obviously, it's very clear because
of the amount of transactional relationships

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:43.029
that go on.

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:47.779
In your personal life, we all have friends
who someone do so much for you that you almost

00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:49.109
feel guilty.

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:53.570
Other ones seem to only come around when they
are asking you for favors and some of them,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.730
"Hey, they help you out.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.320
You help them out."

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.770
It really behooves us to always be thinking
to some [00:18:00] degree, "Okay, givers,

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.859
matchers, takers, who can I trust and win?

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:05.859
Who is there in the good times?

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:06.869
Who is there in the bad times?"

00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:08.609
I think it's always valuable.

00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:10.749
Tom: You talked about context a second ago.

00:18:10.749 --> 00:18:12.129
I want to go back to that.

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:14.580
You've got this notion of intensifiers.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.539
You were talking about genes and like genes
aren't necessarily good and not necessarily

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:23.110
bad, but given context, they can really play
out differently because I get asked a lot

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.750
about, "Do I double the amount of my strengths?

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.840
Do I pop up a weakness?

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.879
What do I do?"

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:33.519
The notion of intensifier [00:18:30] has really
caught my eye because it was ... Maybe that's

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:34.799
fundamentally wrong question.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.389
Maybe you should be asking given the way that
I am, what context should I be seeking?

00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:40.049
Eric: I totally agree.

00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:42.309
I think that's definitely the way to go.

00:18:42.309 --> 00:18:45.269
Gautam Mukunda who is a professor at Harvard
Business School teaches leadership.

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:50.309
He came up with this notion of intensifiers
of the attitudes where we say a lot of personality

00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:53.710
traits or qualities are just bad.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.720
That really doesn't hold up the scrutiny.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.370
If you think about it in interpersonal relationships,
stubbornness [00:19:00] is rarely considered

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.370
a good quality.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.370
That's a bad thing.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.370
You should get rid of your stubbornness.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:09.119
However, we are also very quick to say, "Entrepreneurs,
you've got to greedy.

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:10.380
Stick by your guns.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.460
Don't listen to the haters."

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.899
Sounds like stubbornness to me.

00:19:14.899 --> 00:19:18.139
In context is where it really becomes critical.

00:19:18.139 --> 00:19:21.710
Yes, in your interpersonal relationships,
stubbornness is not so good, but if you're

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.360
an enterpreneur or if you are doing anything
that's really difficult, stubbornness can

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.151
pay off as opposed to be smart, which you
would say is a universally [00:19:30] good

00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:31.869
trait.

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:36.509
Intensifiers are qualities, which on average
at the mean are usually considered negative,

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:42.899
but in the right context can be considered
very positive being overly aggressive might

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:44.440
be considered negative in general.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.820
If you are hiring a litigator, you might want
somebody who is overly aggressive because

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.610
that might be, so again, in this context.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.330
A big part of it is realizing what you are
saying who you are and then aligning your

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:02.289
context so that your context rewards [00:20:00]
both your signature strengths as research

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:06.369
done by Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvania,
what are you uniquely good at?

00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:11.759
Also, your intensifiers where here's my negative
qualities, here's what I get criticized for,

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:13.799
but here stubbornness is an advantage.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:18.559
Here, being overly aggressive is a benefit,
so I'm going to line up my signature strengths,

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:23.149
my intensifiers with my environment so I'm
rewarded for those rather than punished because

00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:25.919
it's so hard to bring up your weaknesses.

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:30.409
You see much greater gains by trying to double
down on your strengths [00:20:30] and the

00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:36.289
first key is knowing what your strengths are,
knowing yourself, knowing a bit in your weaknesses,

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:38.120
knowing what your intensifiers can be.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.460
Then, when you align that with the proper
context, I call it picking the right pond.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.899
You see that everything, your good traits
and your bad traits can potentially benefit

00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:49.899
you.

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:53.229
Tom: One of the examples that you give in
the book is something like if you want to

00:20:53.229 --> 00:20:58.630
be successful in business, pick a drug addict
or something like that.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:05.880
Eric: The thing [00:21:00] is with narcissist,
narcissists often rise to leadership positions.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.789
That's where we get a lot of the advice in
terms of, "Be overconfident.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:09.789
Be dominant.

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:11.640
Be everything."

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.179
Because narcissist usually rise to leadership
positions, however, they don't necessarily

00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:18.080
succeed in leadership positions.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.090
There is getting the job versus being able
to do the job.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.869
Tom: It's a great distinction.

00:21:21.869 --> 00:21:26.259
Eric: Narcissists typically rise or fall in
terms of their performance, in terms of the

00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:27.549
opportunity for glory.

00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:29.289
Tom: That's interesting.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:34.169
Eric: [00:21:30] What's dangerous there is,
obviously, the company is doing well.

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:37.200
"Hey, lots of money, lots of rewards."

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.369
When companies are at their worst is when
you need people to pick up their performance

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:44.710
and it's when narcissist start to least likely
be engaged.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.100
"Stock values drop in.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.759
I'm not going to get rewarded here."

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.259
They do less.

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:55.940
On the other hand and to some degree I was
being funny, but the one researcher at Johns

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.169
Hopkins was saying that narcissist is not
the personality type that [00:22:00] you would

00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:01.399
want for a leader.

00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:07.429
The obsessiveness of a junky, the focus of
a junky and basically he was referring to

00:22:07.429 --> 00:22:11.730
neuroscience research in terms of someone
who is just obsessed.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:17.859
What do we see when every profile you read
of Silicon valley billionaires is just always

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:23.840
obsessed, only sleeps four hours a night,
only thinks about this, works [inaudible 00:22:23]

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.129
reducing their workload to 80 hours a week.

00:22:26.129 --> 00:22:30.080
That obsessiveness versus just, "I want to
look cool."

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.270
[00:22:30] The junky attitude is a better
perspective than the narcissist desire for

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.929
glory when you are looking for a leader who
is going to perform.

00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:42.489
Tom: What drives you, you working insane amount
of hours?

00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:45.279
You said when you were doing the book that
you were working four days a week in the book

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:46.879
and then three days a week in the blog.

00:22:46.879 --> 00:22:50.840
I thought, "Oh, God ..." The amount of words
you have to write, you've written what?

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.059
Five thousand articles or something?

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:54.149
Eric: Yeah.

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:55.779
Tom: It's insanity.

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:57.590
What's the thing that pushes you?

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.929
Eric: I'm excited by [00:23:00] what I do.

00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:04.499
I really enjoy reading.

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:07.520
I really enjoy learning.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.570
I'm always, like your shirt, I'm always questioning
everything.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.149
I'm really, really curious.

00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:19.399
I'll be trying these things and then very
often I have to read five books to find the

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:20.619
one book that's really interesting.

00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:24.929
I read five studies to find the one study,
but then I called the authors or I'll call

00:23:24.929 --> 00:23:30.149
the researchers and I get to talk to the smartest
people about like really cool stuff.

00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:32.379
[00:23:30] To me, that's just intoxicating.

00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:40.240
I guess it's just an issue of perspective
where work is not work if you enjoy it.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.109
To me, it's like what's that next thing?

00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:44.049
What's that next insight?

00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:48.070
Just being able to see how when I apply things
to my life and it makes a difference, and

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:53.499
then to know that I can share with hundred
thousands of people is it feels good.

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:56.529
There's this reinforcing cycle.

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:57.529
For me, it's just fun.

00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:59.399
Tom: Walk me through your career.

00:23:59.399 --> 00:24:04.299
You go into [00:24:00] film, working for some
of the biggest companies on the planet, but

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:07.600
you've reinvented yourself several times.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.340
Take us inside where your mind was, what you
were feeling and how you have the courage

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.590
to totally reinvent yourself multiple times.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:22.119
Eric: I was always somebody who is focused
on big ideas and asking questions.

00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:25.279
My undergrad was in philosophy, oddly enough.

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.730
Then, I did an internship in Hollywood.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.370
I was really excited.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.830
I came [00:24:30] out and I got really lucky
really fast.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.989
I came out one year an extra agent.

00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:36.019
The next year, I sold script.

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:37.340
The next year, I had two movies made.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.599
Then, I got some great [crosstalk 00:24:38].

00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:43.609
Tom: I really try to find you and I'm be like,
"Are you hiding?"

00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:50.129
Eric: You can see some of the movies I've
had produced and some of the projects I have

00:24:50.129 --> 00:24:52.509
worked on.

00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:59.909
Maybe I'm not so proud anymore of what I was
writing when I was 22, 23, but I did for a

00:24:59.909 --> 00:25:00.909
while.

00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:03.960
[00:25:00] It's like Hollywood writer doesn't
have much control.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.629
I just found that that was not fun to be on
this roller coaster.

00:25:08.629 --> 00:25:11.860
I started asking some big questions on myself.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.509
I got a master's degree at UCLA in film.

00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:20.052
I'm really asking a lot of questions and then
I step back and then I went oddly enough.

00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:23.490
I went and got an MBA.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.950
I didn't fit in there at all, so Mr. Creative
Screenwriter ...

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.211
Tom: You started doing marketing for video
games and stuff?

00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:30.211
Eric: Yeah.

00:25:30.211 --> 00:25:34.600
I worked [00:25:30] on the BioShock franchise
and I work for couple different companies.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.070
It was after I got the MBA and I still felt
like, "What am I doing?

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.399
I don't know the answers here."

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:42.750
That I started to blog because I didn't want
to take a job I didn't enjoy.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.100
I was unemployed for nine months.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.429
I just play around in the internet.

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:49.220
It was just something I wanted to do.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.340
Then, I started doing interviews because I
want to talk to experts.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.019
Initially, it was just academic research.

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:57.750
Then, I started looking at the book the researchers
had done.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.240
Then, I decided to even take a step further
[00:26:00] than that because academic research

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.360
in science is great, but they haven't covered
everything.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.279
I started looking at experts in particular
fields because everything has not been covered

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.980
in social science research.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.409
I started drawing on some friends of mine.

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:23.330
My one friend, Chris Voss, a former lead international
hostage negotiator for the FBI.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.019
Here's the guy who knows about negotiation,
might not be based on formal research, but

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:30.150
people live or die based on whether he is
good at his job.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.039
[00:26:30] Good enough for me.

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.580
I call up Chris.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.190
How do we negotiate?

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.359
My friend, James Waters, Navy SEAL platoon
commander.

00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:43.649
Let's find out about grit because if you can
do what you had to do to get where you got,

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:44.840
I want to know what's the best.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.710
Tom: This is a really interesting part of
the book.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.349
Talk about like they were surprised by what
they found.

00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:51.739
We are post-9/11.

00:26:51.739 --> 00:26:53.639
They're really trying to get people in.

00:26:53.639 --> 00:26:57.440
They realized we either have to lower our
standards or find a way to get more people

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440
to pass.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.049
Lowering our standards sounds like a bad idea.

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:01.059
[00:27:00] What was it that they did?

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:02.450
I found this really interesting.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:09.100
Eric: Basically, the Navy had set up of this
called BUDS, Basic Underwater Demolition training

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:14.349
was basically set up to vet people to see
who were the toughest of the tough, who are

00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:19.289
the people who will not give up and those
were the people who would become Navy SEALs.

00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:23.760
The military hadn't done an excellent job
of figuring out what those qualities actually

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760
were.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760
They could vet for them.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.169
Can those guys stay up during hell week?

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:32.499
Can those guy make the runs, do the swims,
[00:27:30] put up with all the hazing and

00:27:32.499 --> 00:27:33.499
abuse?

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:37.870
Yeah, but what were the qualities that actually
allow them to get through and the Navy did

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:42.839
research and what was amazing was it was just
a handful of things.

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:48.639
The critical one I've talked about in the
book was self-talk, optimistic self-talk.

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:50.960
We all have that voice in our head, which
[crosstalk 00:27:51].

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.389
Tom: They started training for this, right?

00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:53.389
Eric: Absolutely.

00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:55.849
Basically, they took the results of the study.

00:27:55.849 --> 00:28:01.489
It was like self-talk, whole setting, and
they basically [00:28:00] started teaching

00:28:01.489 --> 00:28:03.710
students because you don't want to lower the
standards.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:09.369
You don't want to give the answers to the
test, but if you can mold these guys to incorporate

00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:12.369
these elements, then great.

00:28:12.369 --> 00:28:19.659
They started teaching them, and they improved
almost like 8% to 10% passing rate improved

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:26.369
once you started teaching recruits how to
incorporate optimistic self-talk and these

00:28:26.369 --> 00:28:28.419
other habits.

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:32.909
When we talk about grit, when we talk about
[00:28:30] persistence for long-term goals,

00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:38.440
one of the things that's been most proven
is an optimistic mindset is you look at research

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.460
by Angela Duckworth, by Martin Seligman at
University of Pennsylvania is that having

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.429
that optimistic mindset.

00:28:45.429 --> 00:28:51.190
When you believe, "Hey, if I show up tomorrow,
it's going to work out," then you show up.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.279
It make sense.

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:56.419
If you firmly believe, "I'm going to go there
tomorrow and it's going to be a waste of my

00:28:56.419 --> 00:28:57.419
time."

00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:58.419
What do you do?

00:28:58.419 --> 00:28:59.419
It feels futile.

00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:02.450
Over long term goals, if [00:29:00] you feel
like it's going to happen, it's not going

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.999
to warp reality necessarily, what you do might.

00:29:06.999 --> 00:29:11.450
If you don't show up, if you feel like there's
no point to it, you're not going to do it.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:18.460
It comes down to that belief that positive
things are they are personal.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.460
I was responsible.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.629
They are pervasive.

00:29:20.629 --> 00:29:22.729
"Hey, I've crossed some range of areas.

00:29:22.729 --> 00:29:24.099
I can do this", and it's persistent.

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:26.759
"If I do this, it's going to work out."

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:30.980
People who are pessimistic believed the reverse
and so things start [00:29:30] to feel futile.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.989
When things start to feel futile, why continue?

00:29:32.989 --> 00:29:35.169
It doesn't make any sense.

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:40.529
What Seligman's research also showed is that
if that attitude continues long enough or

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:45.779
hard enough, that's how you actually end up
with clinical depression because when life

00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:52.519
feels futile when it does not feel like continuing
anything is going to pay off, then you start

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:56.529
to shrug your shoulders and say, "What am
I doing?"

00:29:56.529 --> 00:30:01.009
Optimism is strongly correlated with happiness
and pessimism is [00:30:00] strongly correlated

00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:03.519
with not only quitting, but also with depression.

00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:08.850
Tom: It was at this point in the book, and
I remember I hadn't found your blog yet unfortunately

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.229
for me.

00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:14.639
I'm reading the book, which was Audible just
recommended it and I'm, "Look, Barking Up

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:15.669
the Wrong Tree.

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:17.229
What I know about success is wrong."

00:30:17.229 --> 00:30:22.509
I had to read your book because I'm all about
like find the evidence that pushes you forward

00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:23.559
rather than just confirm.

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:25.909
That was way too enticing for me not to read
it.

00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:29.269
Then, I get to that part in the book and I'm
like, "Who is this guy?

00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:30.610
This stuff is amazing."

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:35.379
[00:30:30] The notion of optimism being teachable
first of all that it had such a huge impact

00:30:35.379 --> 00:30:38.499
on the number of people going through and
then you took us somewhere, which is like

00:30:38.499 --> 00:30:40.919
my personal fetish, especially as a screenwriter.

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:45.159
I was like who has left the field and I'm
sort of going in the other way.

00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:50.149
I started doing business now going back to
screenwriting and saying, "The whole notion

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:51.519
around narrative."

00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:57.309
In fact, what is it about narrative that they
found was so impactful?

00:30:57.309 --> 00:31:01.840
Eric: Stories are basically the operating
system [00:31:00] of the human brain.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:08.769
If you look across the board, across a bunch
of areas of research, it's quite fascinating.

00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:13.600
John Gutmann who has done bleeding experts
in terms of relationships, marriages.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.039
The most indicating thing in terms of whether
couple will get divorce or not is how they

00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:19.039
tell their story.

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:21.970
It's merely saying, "Tell me the story of
your relationship.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.499
How did you two meet?"

00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:24.499
If it's, "Oh, my God.

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:25.499
It was so wonderful.

00:31:25.499 --> 00:31:26.729
It was this and great.

00:31:26.729 --> 00:31:28.619
We had challenges, but we overcame them.

00:31:28.619 --> 00:31:29.619
We got to know each other better.

00:31:29.619 --> 00:31:33.840
We grew together," [00:31:30] versus, "You
know it's like we met up.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.970
We have some problems."

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:43.209
Just hearing that story is a huge indicator
in terms of the success of children.

00:31:43.209 --> 00:31:48.419
If a child knows its family history, it's
a huge impact on how successful the kid in

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:49.690
school [crosstalk 00:31:49].

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.519
Tom: Example of that like when you say knows
their family story, what do you mean?

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:59.009
Eric: Again, that issue of, "Okay, your great-grandfather
immigrated here from this."

00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:02.519
Tom: If you tell a story [00:32:00] that's
positive and empowering.

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:04.789
Eric: They are a part of something.

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:05.789
It gives reason.

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:07.940
It gives meaning.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:15.369
What you see across the board with that, when
you look at what therapists do very often

00:32:15.369 --> 00:32:17.139
is fixing people's stories.

00:32:17.139 --> 00:32:18.139
"I'm a loser.

00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:19.799
I've always been a loser.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:20.799
This didn't work out.

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:21.799
That didn't work out.

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:22.799
I can't."

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:27.129
Versus you can take the same events and say,
"Oh, this didn't work out, but that's the

00:32:27.129 --> 00:32:32.489
day I learned a great lesson, which ..." [00:32:30]
Same events, but you are telling them in a

00:32:32.489 --> 00:32:34.089
different way.

00:32:34.089 --> 00:32:38.440
Very often, it's not about the specifics of
what happened.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.499
We've all had failures, but which ones do
we choose to define ourselves by?

00:32:43.499 --> 00:32:47.999
It's that story in our head that keeps us
going.

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:52.469
It's deeply important for meaning, but also
deeply important in terms of grit, resilience,

00:32:52.469 --> 00:32:56.659
persistent because, again, that story you
tell yourself.

00:32:56.659 --> 00:33:00.489
Do you tell yourself I'm the kind of person
who "I'm never [00:33:00] going to make it

00:33:00.489 --> 00:33:01.600
through this.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.600
I quit at this.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.099
I quit at that," or "I'm not a quitter."?

00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:08.849
That's the story I tell myself.

00:33:08.849 --> 00:33:12.629
People want to seek out things that support
their story.

00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:14.149
They want to fulfill their story.

00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:18.459
We all know someone who has this vision of
their self in a certain way.

00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:22.460
You present them with that challenge of, "You
think you are so smart?

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.320
Could you do that?"

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.129
People often jump to the challenge.

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:27.129
Why?

00:33:27.129 --> 00:33:29.299
Because they want to support their story.

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:33.339
We have this [00:33:30] evolving story of
ourselves.

00:33:33.339 --> 00:33:37.830
It's really critical for us to feel that we
are part of this.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.210
We've all had how many moments in our lives?

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.210
How many ups?

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.210
How many downs?

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.880
We don't remember all of them.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.499
We don't recall all of them and we don't make
all of them part of our story.

00:33:48.499 --> 00:33:53.200
There's a thousand different ways to frame
the decades that have gone by.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.320
We can shape them in many ways.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.720
How we do actually has a huge effect on whether
we persist, how happy we are, [00:34:00] and

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.299
the decisions we make going forward.

00:34:02.299 --> 00:34:07.049
Tom: When you said that one of the most important
things that a therapist does is spend time

00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:13.490
fixing people's stories, that is so important
to understand like, A, how malleable the stories

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.869
are and really where their importance lies.

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:19.929
One of the things you talked about in the
book, which I love, I took so many notes on

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:25.109
this, was what make stories so effective is
that they abstract.

00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:28.129
That they are not necessarily accurate.

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:31.230
That they allow us that you said to put rose
colored [00:34:30] glasses on.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.440
Talk about that.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:39.200
Eric: This was something that Tyler Cowen,
a big blogger and economics professor at George

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.099
Mason University taught about, which we don't
think about the moments we are here that make

00:34:43.099 --> 00:34:45.019
sense, which is that stories are always narrowed.

00:34:45.019 --> 00:34:47.299
They are always edited.

00:34:47.299 --> 00:34:48.500
You've been alive for decades.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.830
You are not considering every second that
went by.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.610
You are taking little snapshots to tell a
story.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.789
You leave out even if you're telling a joke.

00:34:56.789 --> 00:35:00.039
You only tell the parts that are important
to that joke.

00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:07.039
[00:35:00] Stories are always inaccurate because
you might say, "I consider myself a good person."

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.339
Never done anything bad?

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:09.730
Never done anything you're not proud of?

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:15.000
Of course, you have, but you are to some degree
selecting those things and you feel those

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.530
are more representative of who you are.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.279
Somebody who doesn't feel they're such a good
person is selecting different.

00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:25.450
What's the raw total score of good versus
bad versus ... We don't know.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:29.530
Stories are always inaccurate unless we are
going to recount every second of your life

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.220
and take [00:35:30] every ... We can't.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.650
Stories are always a reduced shortened version
and they usually have a point.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.799
They usually result in, "I feel I'm a good
person.

00:35:39.799 --> 00:35:40.799
I'm persistent."

00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:47.260
Tom: The real power in that and I hope people
take away is that, ultimately, it's up to

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.260
you as the person telling yourself that story
to decide what you leave in and what you leave

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.600
out, which I'm sure it's exactly what the
therapist is helping them do is either just

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.360
reframe the exact same moment or, "Hey, in
your [00:36:00] decades of experience, start

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.480
pulling different moments.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.119
Those moments that you are proud instead of
focusing on the moments that you are not proud

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:06.119
of."

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:07.119
Eric: That's huge.

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:13.390
A lot of this research has worked by Tim Wilson
at UVA and he talks about, again, therapist

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.440
story editing, reframing, looking at different
events, but there's also something else we

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.440
can do.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.720
Some people can do that very well.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:26.930
If somebody has done great things, but they
feel like a loser, then reframing can work

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.710
really well, highlighting different things.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.960
Other people might feel like, "I haven't [00:36:30]
accomplished much."

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.539
For that, Tim Wilson recommend something I
think is wonderful, which is called do good,

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:37.799
be good.

00:36:37.799 --> 00:36:42.630
They've done research to show this works where
rather than people were always thinking, always

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.039
thinking, always thinking.

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:45.039
"No.

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:47.900
You want to feel like a better person?

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.290
Start volunteering once a week.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.680
Go out and do it."

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.760
Then, what will happen is the story will follow
because it's going to be really hard if you

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.589
start saying, "Hey, every paycheck, I'm going
to donate [00:37:00] X amount to charity.

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:05.120
Every week, I'm going to volunteer to help
people."

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.940
All of a sudden, you're going to find after
a few months, it's hard to tell yourself,

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.819
"Oh, yeah, I'm a terrible person."

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:13.670
Because you're going to tell other people,
"I'm a little short of money because I donate

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.670
to charity.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.119
I can't go Sunday.

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:17.809
That's when I volunteer."

00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:22.000
You're going to start to follow, your story
will follow your behavior.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.430
If you have trouble changing your story, first
change your behavior.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.680
Don Quixote, it's like, "You want to be a
knight?

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.609
Act like a [00:37:30] knight."

00:37:32.609 --> 00:37:33.660
Tom: I love that.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.780
I absolutely love that.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.890
You had a research on that that talks about
like chunking that time up?

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:38.890
Eric: Yeah.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.950
Tom: Walk us through that.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:44.700
Eric: That ties in with Adam Grant's research
in terms of givers and takers.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.410
The givers were disproportionately represented
at the top and at the bottom.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.680
Who are the ones at the bottom?

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.269
The ones at the bottom were the ones who did
too much.

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:54.349
They were always focusing on others.

00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:56.040
They were martyrs.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:02.430
Chunking is the idea of, "Hey, [00:38:00]
how am I going to sustainably be able to help

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.680
other people if I'm doing pretty well in myself?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.240
If I make more money, I can donate more money."

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:14.190
Basically, the idea of saying, "I am going
to devote my Sundays to ... That's when I

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:21.530
do my good deeds" or at work basically saying,
"Okay, Thursday afternoons, that's the time

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.619
when things are a little not crazy like Monday.

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:25.339
It's not get everything done by Friday.

00:38:25.339 --> 00:38:30.059
Thursday afternoons, anybody who needs me
or anybody who is 'Hey, can I pick your brain?'

00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:33.690
[00:38:30] That is devoted to that."

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.529
By saying chunking, "I'm going to do my good
deeds here.

00:38:36.529 --> 00:38:38.990
Number one, it make sure that they happen.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.840
Number two, it make sure that they don't just
keep going."

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.840
Once you say to people, "Hey, I want to help,"
you might get more requests than you can possibly

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.829
fulfill.

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:56.619
Having a budget of time, any resource to assist
people and designating it allows to make sure

00:38:56.619 --> 00:39:00.690
it happens so you are a giver, but also make
sure [00:39:00] that it doesn't take over

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.690
your life.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.140
Tom: I love that.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.280
Talk to me a little bit about knowing when
to quit.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.040
That was one of the things I really found
fascinating in the book and I think this is

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.490
so important is what's the difference between
quit and grit.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.549
How do you know when to lean where?

00:39:17.549 --> 00:39:19.710
Eric: Because grit and quit is huge.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.470
Grit is having its moment in the sun now where
everybody is talking about grit.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:24.470
You have to quit some things.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.470
We only have 24 hours in a day.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:29.290
If I never quit anything, I'd still be playing
with action figures and I'd still be playing

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.290
tee-ball.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.290
[00:39:30] You quit things.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.550
You move on.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.049
The truth is that strategic quitting.

00:39:35.049 --> 00:39:39.040
Quitting the right things can actually benefit
grit because you have more time.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.880
If you want those K. Anders Ericsson 10,000
hours of expertise, there's only 24 hours

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.880
in a day.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.880
That's it.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.450
The more stuff you quit that isn't delivering
value to your life, the more resources, the

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.640
more time and energy you have to really become
good at something.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.910
Quitting becomes critical, but that leads
us to the tough question, which is how do

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.170
you know what to quit, what to stick with?

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.940
[00:40:00] We have our passions.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.980
We have our interests.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.759
We have what clearly provide value, but there
are some fascinating research that came out

00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:12.380
of NYU that basically this wonderful little
word, WOOP.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:18.010
It was basically a plan for how people can
take their ideas using research, take their

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:23.039
ideas from a dream to an actual plan.

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:26.529
What they found basically is we think like,
"Oh, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming about dreaming."

00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:30.140
The thing that's dangerous about dreams is
on their own dreams were good first step,

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.579
[00:40:30] but wishing on its own actually
saps energy.

00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:36.900
It doesn't create energy because our brain
is not very good at telling fiction from reality.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.579
That's why movies are exciting.

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:41.640
If we just saw it as, "Oh, that's pixels in
the screen."

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.910
That wouldn't be exciting.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:47.190
You get thrilled because we are not always
good at that.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:52.190
When we dream, our brain starts to think we
already have that and energy levels go down.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.960
Tom: It's so interesting.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.329
Eric: We can start by wishing, but then the
next thing that needs to happen is we need

00:40:58.329 --> 00:41:01.440
to crystallize what [00:41:00] we want.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:06.690
Tom: I have my own answer, but why do you
think if wishing, fantasizing, dreaming about

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.430
it pacifies you because some part of your
brain doesn't realize you don't actually have

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:11.430
it?

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.430
Why do we start there?

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.880
Eric: We start there because we are looking
to what do we want, what do we desire.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.539
Tom: You think it is important to paint a
picture of what you want.

00:41:19.539 --> 00:41:21.089
You just can't get lost them.

00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:24.920
Eric: Just the problem is when you stop there.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.750
Wishing and dreaming is critical.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.029
You need to think about what you want.

00:41:28.029 --> 00:41:35.240
You want to have dreams, but the problem is
[00:41:30] that basically, if wishing by itself

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.099
it's the equivalent of like alcohol, feels
good in the moment, but doesn't necessarily

00:41:39.099 --> 00:41:40.279
make you more productive.

00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:42.490
We need to take the next step.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.090
The next step is to think outcome.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:49.620
WOOP, wish, second thing is outcome, which
is what is the specific thing I want.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.339
"I want to be rich and famous when I ..." What's
the final outcome?

00:41:54.339 --> 00:41:55.720
What is that thing going to be?

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.539
Once you have a specific idea, this is what
I want to be, then [00:42:00] the critical

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:03.940
part, which is obstacle.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.339
What's in the way?

00:42:05.339 --> 00:42:08.240
What is that thing I have to overcome to get
what I want?

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.049
Most people don't, "That's tough.

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:12.910
That's not as fun as just thinking about [inaudible
00:42:12]."

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.349
Wish, outcome, obstacle.

00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:17.960
Once you think about the obstacle, you can
make a plan.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.640
How can I overcome that?

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.290
What's the next step?

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:25.019
What's great is that leads people towards
what's called implementation intentions, which

00:42:25.019 --> 00:42:28.329
is basically a plan for how you can get your
dreams.

00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:32.579
What's also fascinating is in terms [00:42:30]
of the grit of quit question.

00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:39.170
When the research was done, what they found
was that how people felt after doing the exercise

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.849
was very telling.

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:46.650
People who felt energized and excited, that
was generally an indicator that this was a

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.190
realistic possibility.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.140
That they have a dream, but when they thought
about the obstacle, it was surmountable by

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.210
their plan, great.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.069
When people realized that, "Wait.

00:42:56.069 --> 00:43:00.170
This plan is not going to get over this obstacle
and it's not going to get me my dream."

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:04.119
People [00:43:00] didn't feel as energized
and it became a litmus test for determining,

00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:07.680
"Do I need a new plan?

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:14.609
Is this plan not really addressing the issue
or is this dream completely unrealistic?"

00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:19.789
It can be useful in terms of grit or quit
because if you feel energized by it, great,

00:43:19.789 --> 00:43:20.789
go do it.

00:43:20.789 --> 00:43:22.180
This is something you should be sticking with.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.420
If you don't feel it, okay fine.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.450
Maybe you need to reevaluate your plan or
maybe you need to reevaluate your dream.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:33.660
Tom: That's the first [00:43:30] effective
strategy for breaking down when ... When people

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.289
asked me about that, then I said, "Look, you've
got to know when to stick with something and

00:43:38.289 --> 00:43:40.230
when to give up, if you're not enjoying it."

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:44.779
In that, I'm always like, "God, I don't really
know what I'm telling them to do because it's

00:43:44.779 --> 00:43:46.559
like sort of like God instinct."

00:43:46.559 --> 00:43:47.920
That's like an awesome process.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.859
Do you have a similar process because the
other question I get asked all the time is

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:57.160
how do I find my passion, which I'm a fiery
believer that you don't find it, you develop

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.440
it.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.000
Do you have [00:44:00] a process for people
figuring that out?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.529
Eric: I think what you said is exactly right.

00:44:04.529 --> 00:44:06.700
It's the issue of development.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:12.750
Peter Sims wrote this great book called Little
Bets where it turns out to be a system that

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:17.910
you used across the board in many different
areas for people to find their passion, find

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.420
their interest, find things they are good
at.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:24.470
Basically, it's like treating your time almost
like a venture capitalist where little bets

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.060
are small, little efforts.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.560
You're not going to put in a ton of time,
energy or money.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.930
You [00:44:30] are going to try a bunch of
things and you are going to see what works,

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.240
what you enjoy or what you're good at.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:40.079
Like a VC firm might say, "All right, 10 companies,
I know seven are going to fail.

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:41.079
No problem.

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:44.029
Two are probably going to break even and one
is going to be the next Facebook or Google

00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:45.089
and that works for me."

00:44:45.089 --> 00:44:48.549
To say to yourself, I'm going to try 10 different
things.

00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:49.759
I'm going to take a yoga class.

00:44:49.759 --> 00:44:51.319
I'm going to take a martial arts class.

00:44:51.319 --> 00:44:56.260
I'm going to read this book and seven of them
and probably going to say, "Uh-uh, no thanks.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260
Uh-uh."

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.890
Two, I might say, "There's potential here."

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.831
One might be that great new [00:45:00] opportunity
because the world is changing.

00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:06.460
The world is changing so much that we can't
afford to be left behind.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.589
You want to be trying stuff.

00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:13.920
If your grit and focus is fantastic, but you
don't want to be working on horses and buggies

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.480
when the car is being developed.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.109
You don't want to fall behind.

00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:23.299
To always be devoting 5 to 10% of your time,
to trying something new in a low investment

00:45:23.299 --> 00:45:25.490
sort of way to give it a shot.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.930
That's what's going to help you find the next
big thing, find what you are passionate about.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.700
If you are not trying, [00:45:30] you can't
find your passion.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.029
Tom: I like that a lot.

00:45:33.029 --> 00:45:36.720
You are very excitable.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.869
That's clear.

00:45:37.869 --> 00:45:43.519
Has there ever been a time where you were
stuck, there was nothing really calling for

00:45:43.519 --> 00:45:46.440
you?

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.841
I'll put it back in the context of your normal
writing the blogs here, going to other research

00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:52.841
papers and things like that.

00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:55.670
You are not necessarily doing small bets and
looking for something.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:00.869
How do you within that universe if your excitement
is flagging, do you [00:46:00] have a process

00:46:00.869 --> 00:46:03.369
to tap back into something?

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:12.779
Eric: Basically, for me, it's about just getting
some kindling that curiosity where it's like

00:46:12.779 --> 00:46:18.609
asking that question because I definitely
get times where not feeling it.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:19.829
It's not happening.

00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:26.670
What I need is something that starts me asking
a question because even if I read a book and

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.680
I'm like, "There's nothing here.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.450
This isn't really going to help me."

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.650
[00:46:30] Sometimes I'll find myself going,
"What was I'm looking for?

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.740
Oh, I was looking for this.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.150
Is there anything on them?"

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:39.740
All of a sudden, I'm on Amazon.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.650
I'm going, "I can't believe.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.650
Nobody is reading a book on this subject.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:43.650
There's got to be some reading.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:47.180
I'm a Google scholar and I'm like, 'Oh, wait
a second.'"

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:53.220
Once I start that question asking, once I
get a question that makes me go, "Now, I need

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.220
to know."

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.339
We've all felt that to some degree where all
of a sudden you find yourself on Wikipedia

00:46:59.339 --> 00:47:02.789
and then somehow [00:47:00] half hour went
by and I'm clicking around and now I know

00:47:02.789 --> 00:47:06.090
more about the Peloponnesian War than anybody.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:13.059
For me, that's what it's about is if I'm not
feeling that I have to start to say like,

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:15.440
"What am I curious about?"

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.900
Anything that I can do so I want to start
throwing stuff at myself.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.980
I want to start watching a documentary.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:25.839
I want to start reading a book, reading an
article that makes me start asking question

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:30.420
and then sometimes if it is more general,
then I can just go down that rabbit hole.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:35.319
[00:47:30] If it's more specific, then I literally
have to try like trick myself into how does

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:38.480
that relate to what I'm ... "I'm curious about
this."

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:43.529
Redirect that passion because I know once
I get going, I'm like a terrier with the frisbee.

00:47:43.529 --> 00:47:49.849
I'm just not going to let go, but I have to
get that curiosity engine going where there's

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:51.480
like, "Okay, I need the answer to this question."

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.839
Tom: Now, you've had some articles that have
really popped.

00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:02.319
What do they have in common, the ones that
just really knocked it out at the park?

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:03.480
Are there any [00:48:00] threads?

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:11.390
Eric: First off, it's things that interest
most people, so issues of happiness, connecting

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.720
with others, things that are universal.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:22.420
Second, I think it's having really legitimate
science where people are like, "Okay, I'm

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.440
comfortable with this."

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:30.009
Then, I think beyond that is having a level
of warmth and accessibility because the [00:48:30]

00:48:30.009 --> 00:48:37.490
truth is so much of what I post ... Sometimes
the book you might have to find them by, but

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:40.930
most of these research studies, you can just
Google.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:42.289
You don't have to listen to me.

00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:44.109
You can just Google, but it's not fun.

00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:45.630
They are not interesting.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:52.250
They use big words.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:55.309
It's not this kind of fun journey.

00:48:55.309 --> 00:49:00.190
It's like highlighting the stuff that's counterintuitive,
asking the questions that I might [00:49:00]

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.140
ask as a reader, which people can probably
relate to.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.480
Making it accessible, making it a little fun,
throwing a little humor.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:12.529
That's just like having a little sugar to
make the medicine go down or just like you

00:49:12.529 --> 00:49:13.529
are feeling it.

00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:14.809
You are enjoying it.

00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:17.559
I think it makes all the difference in the
world to make it accessible.

00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:23.230
I think finding that balance of something
which is useful, something which is accessible

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:26.730
and something which is legit.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:31.400
If you can combine those three, I think that's
a really [00:49:30] great starting point for

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.720
something that's really going to garner a
lot of attention.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.380
Tom: Why do you think having this is so universal?

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.180
Why do you think people struggle with it so
much?

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:46.970
Eric: It's really tricky because I think that
we have so many competing interests in our

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:47.970
lives.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:54.220
I think a big part of it is that issue of
my book is about success, but I've talked

00:49:54.220 --> 00:50:00.891
a fair amount about happiness because we often
just conflate the two [00:50:00] and that

00:50:00.891 --> 00:50:02.480
doesn't really work.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.170
Just because somebody has a lot of money doesn't
mean they are happy.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.309
Then, just because somebody is happy doesn't
mean they have a lot of money.

00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:14.040
Obviously, we often get this feeling like
if we get power, then that will relate to

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.069
happiness and that's not necessarily the case.

00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:22.499
If you look at the research by Sonja Lyubomirsky,
it showed that happiness leads to success

00:50:22.499 --> 00:50:26.720
more often than success leads to happiness.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:36.220
That vision [00:50:30] of power, power is
obviously for influential and helps us, especially

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:42.049
thousand years ago helped us live longer lives,
but power is very different from like ability,

00:50:42.049 --> 00:50:43.960
from connecting with others.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:49.289
In fact, there's this balance where the more
powerful we feel, often we tend to dehumanize

00:50:49.289 --> 00:50:50.289
others.

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:51.310
Empathy levels decreased.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:51:00.510
Now, power affords great things in life, level
of safety, comfort, but [00:51:00] like ability

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:05.309
is the thing that is most correlated with
happiness, with connecting with others.

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:08.759
When you look at longitudinal studies that
follow people their entire lives like the

00:51:08.759 --> 00:51:14.720
Grant study and the Terman study, it turns
out across the board that relationships are

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.509
what brings us the most happiness, brings
most lives.

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:21.050
Power is not connected with greatness.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:25.170
It's connected with having relationships because
people want stuff from you, but not with great

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:26.170
relationships.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:31.180
I think we often conflate the two that very
often, [00:51:30] especially when it comes

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.240
to the issue of work-life balance, we use
what's called the collapsing metric where

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.280
it's just simpler if we can just track one
thing.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.559
If I can just track that one thing and I can
make that number go up, everything will be

00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:41.559
good in life.

00:51:41.559 --> 00:51:42.559
You know what?

00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.390
Money is a pretty easy number.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:48.230
People often think, "If I could just make
that number go up, everything will work out."

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:53.910
Whereas in many cases, it actually turns out
to be the reverse in the sense that chasing

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:56.089
money means devoting your time to work.

00:51:56.089 --> 00:52:00.230
Devoting your time to work usually means taking
your time away from relationships [00:52:00]

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:05.990
and relationships are the things that are
most connected with meaning in life and happiness.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.170
It needs to be a balance.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:10.920
Tom: One of your blog articles I found this
hilarious.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.509
I don't read Dilbert, but I'm most certain
it was a Dilbert comic.

00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:17.829
The person said, "What should I do to be successful?"

00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:23.559
The woman goes, "Like work every hour of the
day, like give everything up, whatever."

00:52:23.559 --> 00:52:26.319
The guy goes, "That's not going to make me
very happy."

00:52:26.319 --> 00:52:27.890
She goes, "You didn't ask me about happiness."

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:29.299
I thought, "Wow!

00:52:29.299 --> 00:52:32.769
That's actually really [00:52:30] true."

00:52:32.769 --> 00:52:35.029
Relationship is the key cornerstone.

00:52:35.029 --> 00:52:39.140
You have the four things that like people
should really think about in their life.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.480
Happiness is at the top.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.510
What are the other three?

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:46.029
Eric: This is worked by Nash and Stevenson
at Harvard.

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:52.609
They basically looked at the issue like the
work-life balance when people led fulfilling

00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:53.940
lives.

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.869
What they found was that, again, that issue
of a collapsing metric, just having one number

00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:59.819
that didn't work because we all focus on money,
we forgot our relationships.

00:52:59.819 --> 00:53:02.299
We all [00:53:00] focus on relationships,
maybe you can't pay the rent.

00:53:02.299 --> 00:53:05.430
There is a balance here, so the collapsing
metric.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:10.990
The other mistake that people frequently make
is they try a sequencing strategy, which is,

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:14.890
"First, I'm going to start out and I'm going
to do this job that I hate, but I'm going

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:15.890
to make lots of money.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.549
Then, I'm going to focus on this and then
that's not going to work out, but then I'm

00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:24.069
finally going to ..." It's just life is not
that even because, obviously, it's relationships.

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:26.730
You can't just start them when you're in phase
three.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:29.400
It needs regular consistent behavior.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.490
What they found [00:53:30] was that there
were actually four buckets that people needed

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.039
to be regularly putting deposits in.

00:53:35.039 --> 00:53:38.829
The first was happiness, which is basically,
"Are you enjoying what you are doing?"

00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:39.829
The second one is achievement.

00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:40.829
Do you have goals?

00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:42.499
Are you getting closer to them?

00:53:42.499 --> 00:53:43.990
The third was significance.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:48.029
Is what you are doing is having an impact
on the people you love and who love you?

00:53:48.029 --> 00:53:53.480
Then, fourth was legacy, which is to some
degree or another, are you making a positive

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.070
impact on the world?

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.960
When you think about it, the balance of those
four really make sense because you want to

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:05.490
[00:54:00] enjoy life and you do need to pay
the rent, achieve goals, move forward.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:11.769
If we feel like what you are doing isn't benefiting
the people you love at all or maybe even a

00:54:11.769 --> 00:54:14.420
negative, that's not going to lead to a meaningful
life.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.650
Fourth, you don't want to just be selfish
and clannish.

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:22.230
You want to think like I'm doing something
to really put something out there.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:27.339
If you look at your schedule for the week,
for the month and you say, "I'm making small

00:54:27.339 --> 00:54:31.599
deposits in each one of those four," that's
[00:54:30] when you start to be on your way

00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:36.240
towards the level of work-life balance and
towards having a meaningful life.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.930
Tom: It's awesome.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.799
I love that.

00:54:41.799 --> 00:54:45.239
Before I ask my last question actually, where
can these guys find you online?

00:54:45.239 --> 00:54:48.380
Eric: My URL is a little hard to spell.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.940
Tom: Yes, that I will attest.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:55.119
Eric: If people Google, barking up the wrong
tree blog or if they Google, Eric Barker,

00:54:55.119 --> 00:54:58.930
they can find the blog.

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:03.989
The book is Barking Up the Wrong Tree [00:55:00]
on Amazon or other bookstore or look at my

00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:04.989
name, Eric Barker.

00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:06.710
Tom: I'll save you guys a little bit of time.

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:11.690
The Eric Barker who died in the '90s, this
is not the Eric Barker.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:12.690
Awesome!

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:16.289
My last question, what is the impact that
you want to have on the world?

00:55:16.289 --> 00:55:24.410
Eric: I want to help people make better choices
that help them lead better lives because like

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:30.089
that William Gibson quote, "A lot of these
answers are out there."

00:55:30.089 --> 00:55:35.200
There's [00:55:30] a distinction that's made
between puzzles and mysteries.

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:42.460
Puzzles are things that have an answer.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.940
How many dollars do I have in my pocket?

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.119
There's an answer to that.

00:55:46.119 --> 00:55:49.380
You might not know it right now, but there's
an answer to that.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.380
There's mysteries.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.380
What is the meaning of life?

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.150
There is no clear immediate answer to that.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:59.540
I think a lot of the things that we think
are mysteries are actually puzzles.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:01.260
What do we have to do [00:56:00] to be more
productive?

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.609
What do we have to do to live happy lives?

00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:05.140
What do we do to have good relationships?

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.529
We think often, "Oh, my God.

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:07.630
It's just big mystery."

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.440
No, I think [inaudible 00:56:08] puzzles.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.069
Sometimes there are answers.

00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:15.119
Sometimes there are things we can do if not
to get the perfect solution to at least get

00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:18.089
better.

00:56:18.089 --> 00:56:23.580
I'm obsessive about doing this blog, writing
my book and trying to find these answers so

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.200
that I can live a better life.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.630
I would feel guilty if I wasn't sharing that,
just putting [00:56:30] it out there that

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:35.319
people can appreciate it and enjoy it and
hopefully use those things to make better

00:56:35.319 --> 00:56:42.470
decisions that help them live better lives
because the answers are very often there.

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:44.349
We just need to connect the answers with the
people.

00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:45.410
Tom: That's awesome.

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.520
Eric, thank you so much for coming on.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520
Eric: Thanks, buddy.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.520
I appreciate it.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.869
Tom: Guys, it is very rare that somebody's
answer of how they want to impact the world

00:56:52.869 --> 00:56:56.529
is so in alignment with what they are actually
doing on a day-to-day basis.

00:56:56.529 --> 00:56:59.599
Dive into his work, check out his website.

00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:05.799
The sheer [00:57:00] volume of information
is astonishing and everyone of the articles

00:57:05.799 --> 00:57:07.230
is well-worth the time.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:12.359
It is a rabbit hole so deep and compelling,
you will go down and not come up for hours

00:57:12.359 --> 00:57:15.619
because one thing will lead to the next and
he is very good about at the end of the article.

00:57:15.619 --> 00:57:18.390
He tells you, "There's another one that you
might like to read."

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:20.369
You will just keep going and going and going.

00:57:20.369 --> 00:57:23.569
It is utterly fascinating because he really
is going that layer deeper.

00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:27.670
He is digging into the platitude and asking
what part of this is so true that it's become

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:31.259
a platitude and it's carried on for so long
and [00:57:30] what part of its false that

00:57:31.259 --> 00:57:36.210
actually deserves a deeper look so that we
can really find out and take this from being

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:39.579
a mystery to being a puzzle that is ultimately
solvable?

00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:40.579
Dive in.

00:57:40.579 --> 00:57:41.619
You will not regret it.
