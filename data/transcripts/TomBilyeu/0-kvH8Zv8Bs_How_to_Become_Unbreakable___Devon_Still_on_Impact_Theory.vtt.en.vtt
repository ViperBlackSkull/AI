00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:02.180 align:start position:0%
feelings and compare it to the pain I
 

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:12.290 align:start position:0%
use my pain in order to get many

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
think this would
 

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.900 align:start position:0%
think this would
like<00:26:28.110><c> and</c><00:26:28.350><c> that's</c><00:26:28.500><c> a</c><00:26:28.770><c> certain</c><00:26:29.130><c> kind</c><00:26:29.340><c> of</c><00:26:29.460><c> RAD</c>

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:29.910 align:start position:0%
like and that's a certain kind of RAD
 

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
like and that's a certain kind of RAD
and<00:26:30.000><c> then</c><00:26:30.240><c> there's</c><00:26:30.570><c> what</c><00:26:30.990><c> I'm</c><00:26:31.110><c> going</c><00:26:31.470><c> through</c>

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:31.650 align:start position:0%
and then there's what I'm going through
 

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.050 align:start position:0%
and then there's what I'm going through
are<00:26:31.770><c> gonna</c><00:26:31.890><c> have</c><00:26:32.130><c> to</c><00:26:32.280><c> go</c><00:26:32.400><c> through</c><00:26:32.430><c> in</c><00:26:32.820><c> order</c><00:26:32.910><c> to</c>

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
are gonna have to go through in order to
 

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.940 align:start position:0%
are gonna have to go through in order to
get<00:26:33.330><c> there</c><00:26:33.570><c> have</c><00:26:34.020><c> there</c><00:26:34.200><c> been</c><00:26:34.320><c> times</c><00:26:34.380><c> where</c>

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
get there have there been times where
 

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.260 align:start position:0%
get there have there been times where
you're<00:26:35.070><c> like</c><00:26:35.220><c> add</c><00:26:35.460><c> the</c><00:26:35.670><c> math</c><00:26:35.820><c> equation</c>

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:36.270 align:start position:0%
you're like add the math equation
 

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:36.830 align:start position:0%
you're like add the math equation
doesn't<00:26:36.480><c> add</c><00:26:36.660><c> up</c>

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't add up
 

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.130 align:start position:0%
doesn't add up
and<00:26:37.020><c> so</c><00:26:37.560><c> now</c><00:26:37.710><c> I'm</c><00:26:37.770><c> gonna</c><00:26:37.890><c> stop</c><00:26:38.360><c> it</c><00:26:39.360><c> happened</c>

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
