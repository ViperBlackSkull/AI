00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
like the most foundational it's probably
 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.070 align:start position:0%
like the most foundational it's probably

not the sum total yeah but the
 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.589 align:start position:0%
not the sum total yeah but the

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
actually do the hard things is almost
 

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.830 align:start position:0%

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
think fasting is a way to tap into that

think fasting is a way to tap into that
and<00:27:37.600><c> um</c><00:27:38.000><c> so</c><00:27:38.240><c> there's</c><00:27:38.480><c> a</c><00:27:38.559><c> physical</c><00:27:38.960><c> mental</c><00:27:39.279><c> and</c>

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
and um so there's a physical mental and
 

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.950 align:start position:0%
and um so there's a physical mental and
spiritual<00:27:39.760><c> component</c><00:27:40.159><c> to</c><00:27:40.320><c> fasting</c><00:27:40.720><c> that</c><00:27:40.880><c> i</c>

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
spiritual component to fasting that i
 

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.149 align:start position:0%
spiritual component to fasting that i
just<00:27:41.200><c> love</c><00:27:41.520><c> and</c><00:27:42.080><c> so</c><00:27:42.240><c> for</c><00:27:42.399><c> me</c><00:27:42.720><c> i</c><00:27:42.960><c> will</c><00:27:43.600><c> i</c>

i<00:29:00.720><c> think</c><00:29:01.279><c> super</c><00:29:01.600><c> important</c><00:29:01.919><c> for</c><00:29:02.159><c> people</c><00:29:02.480><c> to</c>

i think super important for people to
 

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.470 align:start position:0%

00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
