00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
As Walt Disney said

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.920
|f you can dream it

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.545
you can do it

00:00:06.295 --> 00:00:08.175
Now what makes me laugh is i know

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.500
right now, some of the people listening to that,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.480
they say that's bullshit

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.780
there are just limits

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.420
to what humans can do

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.685
And i get that response

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:18.720
I understand it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.560
I used to respond to everything like that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.040
I used to see only the difficulty

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.620
I used to see only the  ways

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.140
in which it couldn't work out

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.740
And I couldn't see I was literally blinded by fear

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.580
I was blinded by some bizarre sense of pride

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.080
that wanted to justify my limited existence

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.960
that didn"t wanna have to face that I could be doing more

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.520
that i could be more
that my life was somehow less

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.680
than what it could be

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100
And so I would laugh at quotes like that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.280
And i know right now I've the chills

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.080
I know right now

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.240
there are people that are laughing at that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.540
All they can think about are the limits

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.500
All they can think about are the things

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260
that prove him wrong
And guess what

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880
he is wrong

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.680
There really are limits

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.560
But if you fucking waist your time focused on that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.300
You'll never going to create the momentum that you need

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.360
to actually make something come true in your life

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160
You can build virtually anything  but

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.680
if you get hung up on the fucking virtual part
if you let that stop you

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.880
If you

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:21.380
immediately go to the things that ultimatelly limit you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.200
and hold you back

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.780
that is where you gonna stay forever because if you argue for your limitations

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.360
guess what my friend

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.740
they become

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.080
yours

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:33.205
And congratulations
You now get to live in that box

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:35.900
You get to live in that self defined prison

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.440
but if  like Teddy Roosevelt said

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.120
Instead of that you keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.100
And you don't act

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.060
like somebody who can't see that sure there are limits There are edges to this universe

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.280
But you're looking not at that

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.520
You're looking at how you really execute

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.480
You're dreaming big and you're remembering that your feet ultimately is that contact point

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.940
It is where the rubber meets the road

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.520
It is that moment of doing

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.440
And so if instead of rejecting it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.820
because your feet must stay planted on the ground

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.700
remember that in keeping your feet on the ground that's the moment of action

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.900
That's the moment of doing something about it

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.100
that's the moment of seeing the fucking possibillities and then

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.620
moving

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.335
doing something making it real

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.385
so  right now give up on those weird

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.095
mental mechanisms that make you actually

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:35.235
want to fight  for the things that are impossible

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:38.725
to get people to believe in it to get people to understand why

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.555
you've chosen to stand still

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.900
instead of that convience yourself that  you should be moving

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.040
And go do what you know

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.260
you're destined to do
