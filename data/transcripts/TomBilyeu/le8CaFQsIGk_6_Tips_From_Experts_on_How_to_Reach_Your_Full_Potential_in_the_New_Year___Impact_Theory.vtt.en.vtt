00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
on that which are i think will really
 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.110 align:start position:0%
on that which are i think will really
shake<00:04:32.240><c> people</c><00:04:32.639><c> out</c>

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
shake people out
 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.870 align:start position:0%
shake people out
yeah<00:04:33.440><c> um</c><00:04:33.840><c> and</c><00:04:33.919><c> then</c><00:04:34.080><c> of</c><00:04:34.240><c> course</c><00:04:34.560><c> there's</c>

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um and then of course there's
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.629 align:start position:0%
yeah um and then of course there's
neutral<00:04:35.199><c> thinking</c><00:04:35.600><c> so</c><00:04:35.919><c> i</c><00:04:36.080><c> think</c><00:04:36.240><c> that's</c><00:04:36.479><c> sort</c>

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
neutral thinking so i think that's sort
 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.590 align:start position:0%
neutral thinking so i think that's sort
of<00:04:36.880><c> uh</c>

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
of uh
 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.430 align:start position:0%
of uh
the<00:04:37.759><c> next</c><00:04:38.240><c> one</c><00:04:38.560><c> two</c><00:04:38.880><c> that</c><00:04:39.040><c> we</c><00:04:39.120><c> should</c><00:04:39.280><c> walk</c>

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
the next one two that we should walk
 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.710 align:start position:0%
the next one two that we should walk
through<00:04:39.840><c> yeah</c><00:04:40.240><c> and</c><00:04:40.400><c> and</c>

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
through yeah and and
 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
through yeah and and
and<00:04:40.880><c> then</c><00:04:41.040><c> i</c><00:04:41.120><c> think</c><00:04:41.280><c> probably</c><00:04:41.600><c> the</c><00:04:41.680><c> third</c><00:04:42.000><c> part</c>

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
and then i think probably the third part
 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.909 align:start position:0%
and then i think probably the third part
of<00:04:42.240><c> that</c><00:04:42.400><c> would</c><00:04:42.560><c> be</c><00:04:42.880><c> sort</c><00:04:43.040><c> of</c><00:04:43.199><c> the</c><00:04:43.440><c> impact</c><00:04:43.759><c> of</c>

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
of that would be sort of the impact of
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
of that would be sort of the impact of
behavior

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know of identifying behavior but

if it's negative it's four to seven

it's<00:09:07.120><c> 40</c><00:09:07.680><c> to</c><00:09:07.920><c> 70</c><00:09:08.399><c> times</c>

that relates to a lot of the work that
you<00:11:04.880><c> do</c>

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
you do
 

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.030 align:start position:0%
you do

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
um because this false sense of a self
 

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.389 align:start position:0%
um because this false sense of a self
is<00:11:09.279><c> actually</c><00:11:09.440><c> where</c><00:11:09.680><c> a</c><00:11:09.760><c> lot</c><00:11:09.920><c> of</c><00:11:10.079><c> human</c>

you think our real challenges are
 

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.230 align:start position:0%
you think our real challenges are
and<00:15:55.120><c> then</c><00:15:55.279><c> you</c><00:15:55.440><c> say</c><00:15:55.600><c> well</c><00:15:55.759><c> you</c><00:15:55.920><c> know</c><00:15:56.000><c> we</c><00:15:56.079><c> can't</c>

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
and then you say well you know we can't
 

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.829 align:start position:0%
and then you say well you know we can't

00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
get the supplies in time and then you
 

00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
get the supplies in time and then you
say<00:15:58.000><c> well</c><00:15:58.240><c> and</c><00:15:58.399><c> also</c><00:15:58.800><c> we</c><00:15:58.959><c> don't</c><00:15:59.120><c> have</c><00:15:59.199><c> enough</c>

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
supplies so long to get here
and<00:16:05.040><c> you</c><00:16:05.120><c> say</c><00:16:05.279><c> well</c><00:16:05.519><c> you</c><00:16:05.600><c> know</c><00:16:05.759><c> they're</c><00:16:05.920><c> coming</c>

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
and you say well you know they're coming
 

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.710 align:start position:0%
and you say well you know they're coming
across<00:16:06.880><c> the</c><00:16:07.040><c> country</c><00:16:07.440><c> on</c><00:16:07.600><c> a</c><00:16:07.839><c> truck</c>

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.389 align:start position:0%
across the country on a truck
and<00:16:08.880><c> so</c><00:16:09.040><c> it's</c><00:16:09.199><c> going</c><00:16:09.279><c> to</c><00:16:09.360><c> take</c><00:16:09.839><c> you</c><00:16:10.000><c> know</c><00:16:10.320><c> a</c>

and<00:16:12.480><c> we</c><00:16:12.639><c> don't</c><00:16:12.800><c> have</c><00:16:12.959><c> enough</c><00:16:13.199><c> people</c><00:16:13.600><c> because</c>

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
and we don't have enough people because
 

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:16.150 align:start position:0%
and we don't have enough people because
it's<00:16:13.920><c> going</c><00:16:14.000><c> to</c><00:16:14.079><c> take</c><00:16:14.560><c> 190</c><00:16:15.279><c> man</c><00:16:15.519><c> hours</c><00:16:15.839><c> in</c><00:16:15.920><c> this</c>

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to take 190 man hours in this
 

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.430 align:start position:0%
it's going to take 190 man hours in this
amount<00:16:16.320><c> of</c><00:16:16.480><c> time</c>

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.910 align:start position:0%

and<00:16:17.759><c> and</c><00:16:17.920><c> i</c><00:16:18.000><c> only</c><00:16:18.240><c> have</c><00:16:18.399><c> three</c><00:16:18.639><c> guys</c><00:16:19.199><c> so</c><00:16:19.759><c> it's</c>

i<00:16:29.440><c> guess</c><00:16:29.680><c> we</c><00:16:29.839><c> could</c><00:16:30.560><c> we</c><00:16:30.720><c> could</c><00:16:30.880><c> fly</c><00:16:31.120><c> but</c><00:16:31.279><c> it's</c>

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
i guess we could we could fly but it's
 

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.189 align:start position:0%
i guess we could we could fly but it's
going<00:16:31.440><c> to</c><00:16:31.519><c> be</c><00:16:31.600><c> more</c><00:16:31.759><c> expensive</c><00:16:32.240><c> oh</c>

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
going to be more expensive oh
 

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:35.269 align:start position:0%
going to be more expensive oh
okay<00:16:33.519><c> well</c><00:16:33.680><c> how</c><00:16:33.839><c> much</c><00:16:34.000><c> more</c><00:16:34.160><c> expensive</c><00:16:35.199><c> you</c>

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay well how much more expensive you
 

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.470 align:start position:0%
okay well how much more expensive you
see<00:16:35.440><c> what</c><00:16:35.600><c> i'm</c><00:16:35.680><c> saying</c><00:16:36.000><c> right</c><00:16:36.240><c> and</c><00:16:36.320><c> so</c>
