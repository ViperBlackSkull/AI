00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
you got good grades and so cheating was
 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.210 align:start position:0%
you got good grades and so cheating was

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 align:start position:0%
a perfectly reasonable solution to that
 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.909 align:start position:0%

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 align:start position:0%
would I cheat if I'm going to try to get
 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
would I cheat if I'm going to try to get

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
a career out of this again why would I
cheat<00:05:42.100><c> and</c><00:05:42.370><c> if</c><00:05:42.460><c> I'm</c><00:05:42.610><c> taking</c><00:05:43.030><c> on</c><00:05:43.150><c> massive</c>

this why would a cheat it doesn't make
sense<00:05:47.200><c> and</c><00:05:47.380><c> so</c><00:05:47.740><c> in</c><00:05:47.979><c> that</c><00:05:48.310><c> I</c><00:05:48.370><c> switched</c><00:05:48.940><c> from</c>

that task oriented mindset to really
 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.250 align:start position:0%

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 align:start position:0%
thinking bigger about my goals there
 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
thinking bigger about my goals there
were<00:05:53.350><c> things</c><00:05:53.560><c> in</c><00:05:53.830><c> life</c><00:05:54.010><c> that</c><00:05:54.039><c> I</c><00:05:54.250><c> wanted</c><00:05:54.550><c> to</c>

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 align:start position:0%
were things in life that I wanted to
 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.370 align:start position:0%
were things in life that I wanted to
achieve<00:05:54.789><c> that</c><00:05:55.180><c> I</c><00:05:55.210><c> wanted</c><00:05:55.539><c> to</c><00:05:55.600><c> accomplish</c><00:05:55.930><c> and</c>

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 align:start position:0%
achieve that I wanted to accomplish and
 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.610 align:start position:0%
achieve that I wanted to accomplish and
I<00:05:57.130><c> had</c><00:05:57.610><c> to</c><00:05:57.880><c> then</c><00:05:58.419><c> reverse</c><00:05:58.660><c> engineer</c><00:05:59.380><c> what</c><00:05:59.590><c> I</c>

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 align:start position:0%
I had to then reverse engineer what I
 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
I had to then reverse engineer what I
needed<00:05:59.890><c> to</c><00:06:00.070><c> do</c><00:06:00.220><c> to</c><00:06:00.430><c> get</c><00:06:00.550><c> there</c><00:06:00.760><c> and</c><00:06:00.910><c> so</c><00:06:01.150><c> when</c>

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 align:start position:0%
needed to do to get there and so when
 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
needed to do to get there and so when
you<00:06:02.020><c> look</c><00:06:02.320><c> at</c><00:06:02.380><c> that</c><00:06:02.530><c> so</c><00:06:02.770><c> another</c><00:06:03.220><c> great</c>

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
you look at that so another great
 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.550 align:start position:0%
you look at that so another great
example<00:06:03.640><c> I</c><00:06:04.210><c> use</c><00:06:04.570><c> the</c><00:06:04.600><c> word</c><00:06:04.780><c> instead</c><00:06:05.169><c> of</c><00:06:05.229><c> task</c>

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
example I use the word instead of task
 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.770 align:start position:0%
example I use the word instead of task
and<00:06:05.890><c> goal</c><00:06:06.039><c> I</c><00:06:06.070><c> use</c><00:06:06.370><c> the</c><00:06:06.460><c> words</c><00:06:06.640><c> path</c><00:06:07.000><c> and</c><00:06:07.300><c> goal</c>

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 align:start position:0%
and goal I use the words path and goal
 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
and goal I use the words path and goal
so<00:06:08.350><c> I</c><00:06:08.710><c> think</c><00:06:08.860><c> about</c><00:06:09.130><c> a</c><00:06:09.250><c> path</c><00:06:09.520><c> as</c><00:06:09.789><c> being</c><00:06:10.030><c> totally</c>

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 align:start position:0%
so I think about a path as being totally
 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.750 align:start position:0%
so I think about a path as being totally
irrelevant<00:06:10.990><c> and</c><00:06:11.470><c> you</c><00:06:12.100><c> could</c><00:06:12.250><c> switch</c><00:06:12.490><c> paths</c>

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
irrelevant and you could switch paths
 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
irrelevant and you could switch paths
give<00:06:13.030><c> up</c><00:06:13.180><c> on</c><00:06:13.300><c> a</c><00:06:13.360><c> path</c><00:06:13.570><c> totally</c><00:06:14.080><c> abandon</c><00:06:14.440><c> a</c><00:06:14.530><c> path</c>

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
give up on a path totally abandon a path
 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.590 align:start position:0%
give up on a path totally abandon a path
and<00:06:14.919><c> never</c><00:06:15.430><c> lose</c><00:06:15.820><c> sight</c><00:06:16.030><c> of</c><00:06:16.060><c> what</c><00:06:16.240><c> your</c><00:06:16.360><c> goal</c>

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
and never lose sight of what your goal
 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 align:start position:0%
is so my goal now is to pull people out
 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
is so my goal now is to pull people out

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.590 align:start position:0%

like it's going to achieve balance
 

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.020 align:start position:0%
