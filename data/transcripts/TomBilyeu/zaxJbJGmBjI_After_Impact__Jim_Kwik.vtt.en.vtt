00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:19.009 align:start position:0%
makes you better than you really are
 

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:21.069 align:start position:0%
makes you better than you really are
and<00:11:19.369><c> so</c><00:11:19.789><c> it</c><00:11:20.119><c> becomes</c><00:11:20.389><c> a</c><00:11:20.599><c> stripping</c><00:11:20.959><c> away</c>

00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%

pattern<00:27:16.870><c> like</c><00:27:17.559><c> the</c><00:27:17.740><c> different</c><00:27:18.070><c> solutions</c><00:27:18.730><c> so</c>

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
pattern like the different solutions so
 

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
pattern like the different solutions so
so<00:27:20.049><c> there's</c><00:27:20.230><c> no</c><00:27:20.350><c> creativity</c><00:27:20.799><c> without</c><00:27:21.280><c> mastery</c>

00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:21.909 align:start position:0%
so there's no creativity without mastery
 

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
so there's no creativity without mastery
I<00:27:21.940><c> don't</c><00:27:22.450><c> not</c><00:27:22.720><c> not</c><00:27:23.610><c> I'm</c><00:27:24.610><c> going</c><00:27:25.600><c> to</c><00:27:25.659><c> ask</c><00:27:25.809><c> you</c><00:27:25.990><c> to</c>

sort of painting on top of it like your
interpretation<00:27:40.480><c> is</c><00:27:40.630><c> creative</c><00:27:41.110><c> more</c><00:27:41.740><c> than</c>

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
interpretation is creative more than
 

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
interpretation is creative more than
necessarily<00:27:42.309><c> what</c><00:27:42.549><c> they</c><00:27:42.640><c> created</c><00:27:43.059><c> was</c>

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:18.820 align:start position:0%
like what is the definition of creative
 

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
like what is the definition of creative
and<00:28:19.179><c> I</c><00:28:19.539><c> think</c><00:28:19.780><c> that's</c><00:28:20.020><c> really</c><00:28:20.440><c> where</c><00:28:21.150><c> because</c>

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.150 align:start position:0%

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:27.070 align:start position:0%
paperclips not very interesting so the
 

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.950 align:start position:0%
paperclips not very interesting so the
fact<00:28:27.309><c> that</c><00:28:27.400><c> they</c><00:28:27.549><c> can</c><00:28:27.730><c> bend</c><00:28:27.909><c> it</c><00:28:28.030><c> into</c><00:28:28.179><c> 150</c>

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%

different<00:28:29.110><c> shapes</c><00:28:29.500><c> like</c><00:28:30.040><c> so</c><00:28:30.580><c> what</c><00:28:31.290><c> but</c><00:28:32.290><c> give</c>

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%

remember how hard it was to get a good

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
guest for us in the beginning so it was
 

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.099 align:start position:0%
guest for us in the beginning so it was
like<00:40:23.910><c> all</c><00:40:24.180><c> those</c><00:40:24.330><c> things</c><00:40:24.390><c> come</c><00:40:24.780><c> together</c><00:40:24.869><c> and</c>

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:25.109 align:start position:0%
like all those things come together and
 

00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:27.530 align:start position:0%
like all those things come together and
I<00:40:25.170><c> want</c><00:40:25.320><c> to</c><00:40:25.380><c> do</c><00:40:25.440><c> that</c><00:40:25.560><c> and</c><00:40:25.770><c> then</c><00:40:26.280><c> now</c><00:40:27.180><c> it's</c><00:40:27.420><c> had</c>

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
I want to do that and then now it's had
 

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
I want to do that and then now it's had
to<00:40:27.630><c> change</c><00:40:27.869><c> to</c><00:40:28.080><c> where</c><00:40:28.230><c> I</c><00:40:28.500><c> will</c><00:40:29.099><c> do</c><00:40:29.400><c> it</c><00:40:29.670><c> if</c><00:40:29.910><c> I</c><00:40:30.359><c> can</c>

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:30.930 align:start position:0%
to change to where I will do it if I can
 

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
to change to where I will do it if I can
so<00:40:31.560><c> now</c><00:40:32.010><c> becomes</c><00:40:32.430><c> a</c><00:40:32.730><c> scheduling</c><00:40:33.540><c> concern</c><00:40:33.990><c> and</c>

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:34.290 align:start position:0%
so now becomes a scheduling concern and
 

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.770 align:start position:0%
so now becomes a scheduling concern and
then<00:40:34.530><c> I</c><00:40:34.619><c> just</c><00:40:34.770><c> prioritize</c><00:40:35.040><c> based</c><00:40:35.609><c> on</c><00:40:35.849><c> who</c><00:40:36.090><c> who</c>

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
then I just prioritize based on who who
 

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.150 align:start position:0%
then I just prioritize based on who who
will<00:40:36.930><c> allow</c><00:40:37.109><c> me</c><00:40:37.380><c> to</c><00:40:37.410><c> have</c><00:40:37.530><c> the</c><00:40:37.770><c> biggest</c><00:40:38.040><c> impact</c>

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
