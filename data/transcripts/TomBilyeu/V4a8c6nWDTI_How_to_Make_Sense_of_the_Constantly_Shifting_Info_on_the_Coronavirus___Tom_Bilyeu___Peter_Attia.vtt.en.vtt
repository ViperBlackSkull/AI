I've looked a lot into cold exposure and
heat<00:14:41.850><c> exposure</c><00:14:42.300><c> for</c><00:14:42.870><c> different</c><00:14:43.200><c> reasons</c>

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.820 align:start position:0%

my<00:14:44.250><c> cold</c><00:14:44.910><c> exposure</c><00:14:45.450><c> is</c><00:14:45.840><c> quite</c><00:14:46.200><c> interesting</c>

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:46.830 align:start position:0%

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.250 align:start position:0%
really the data on cold exposure so I
 

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.380 align:start position:0%
really the data on cold exposure so I

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%

the<00:14:54.390><c> first</c><00:14:54.660><c> is</c><00:14:54.870><c> it</c><00:14:55.050><c> clearly</c><00:14:55.410><c> has</c><00:14:55.680><c> a</c><00:14:55.710><c> benefit</c><00:14:56.310><c> in</c>

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.490 align:start position:0%
the first is it clearly has a benefit in
