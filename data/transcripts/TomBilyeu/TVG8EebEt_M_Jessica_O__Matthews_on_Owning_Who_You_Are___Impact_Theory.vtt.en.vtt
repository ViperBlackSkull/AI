00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.740
Tom: Hi, everybody.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.810
Welcome to "Impact Theory".

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.980
You are here, my friends, because you believe
that human potential is nearly limitless,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.590
but you know that having potential is not
the same as actually doing something with

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.480
it, so our goal, with this show, and company,
is to introduce you to the people, and ideas,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.579
that are gonna help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.509
All right.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.249
Today's guest is a force of nature.

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.400
She is a venture backed, Founder/CEO, and
inventor.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.870
She created her first game changing product
at age 19, and she founded Uncharted Play,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.739
a renewable energy company, at 22, while still
attending Harvard.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.969
Instead of dropping out, like other high profile
entrepreneurs, she just did both, because

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.520
well, when you box for fun and consider yourself
a cross between Bill Nye and Beyonce, that's

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.219
just how you roll.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.750
I'm not sure that even the superhuman that
would be the Beyonce-Bill Nye hybrid can keep

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.079
up with today's guest.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.070
Despite having no formal training in the hard
sciences, not only did she invent a product

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.430
that turns a soccer ball into a power plant,
but her company now holds 15 patents, and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.760
patents pending.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.340
She also managed to raise seven million dollars
to supercharge her company's growth, the largest

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.259
raise ever by a woman of color, and she's
partnered with Fortune 500 companies to completely

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.189
rethink how energy is generated and distributed.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.890
Not surprisingly, Inc. Magazine, named Uncharted
Play one of the 25 most audacious companies

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.010
in the world.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.710
Fast Company named them one of the 10 most
innovative companies in the world, and she

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.720
personally was named to Fortune's most promising
women entrepreneurs list, Forbes 30 under

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.829
30, and when Obama needed somebody to represent
small businesses, when he signed the historic

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.710
America Invents Act, he chose her.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.979
Please, help me in welcoming the female innovator,
who has been called the Elon Musk of kinetic

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.689
energy, the woman Oprah named to the SuperSoul
100, the real life Riri Williams, Jessica

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.689
O. Matthews.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.440
Jessica, thank you so much for coming on.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.860
Jessica: Thank you.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.430
Tom: What a pleasure to have you.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.250
Jessica: Real life Riri Williams.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.349
Tom: Yes, which is why I'm wearing this shirt.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.989
Jessica: That's so dope.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.230
Tom: I completely, really enjoyed doing the
research on you.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.620
When I saw in one of the articles that I was
reading that you dressed up as Riri for Halloween,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.660
I said, "All right".

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.660
Jessica: Yeah.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.660
Yeah.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.660
Tom: This is my kind of woman.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.660
I respect that.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.930
I'm huge into comic books, and really believe
that they actually have tremendous power as

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.050
archetypes, as mythology, so ...
Jessica: Me too, like anime, and manga, I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.180
remember the first time I read Akira.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.819
I just believe in the ability to use play
to think about the world.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.849
That, to me, is exactly what comic books do.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.849
Tom: All right.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:50.849
I didn't expect to start here.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:51.849
Jessica: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:52.849
Tom: But since you said that, let's dive right
into the Tooth Fairy.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:53.849
Jessica: Yes.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.360
Tom: Tell us why the Tooth Fairy is meaningful
to you.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.730
Jessica: No, so I believed in the Tooth Fairy
until I was 12-years-old.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.130
Okay, it is generally embarrassing, but I
like to tell people that because I didn't

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.989
necessarily grow up in a house where we allowed
certain stories like this to kind of spread,

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.170
and progress, and become bigger than life.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.239
My mom was the mom that would be wrapping
up the Christmas presents the night before

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.620
Christmas, being like, "Oh, yeah.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.159
Hold this, do this, do that".

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.019
Like, Santa Claus was not coming to my house.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.659
I knew exactly what my mom paid for it, I
knew what was going on, I knew the hard work

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.269
that went into it.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.500
For some odd reason, given, rather, despite
the fact that I had parents who were very,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.640
I think, direct about the realities of life,
the realities of the world, and the hard work

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.069
it takes to get anything, they decided to
move forward with the "fib" of the Tooth Fairy.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.439
For me, because that didn't really make sense,
I just assumed, "The Tooth Fairy must be real.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.370
It must be because my parents would not give
me money for my teeth.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.060
I just don't think they see the value in my
teeth".

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.590
I have Nigerian parents, this just doesn't
make sense.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.750
What I love for that, and I have several reasons
for why I love my parents, and everything

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.970
that they did, and continue to do, but I think
what really made that something that was special

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.390
for me, is that they allowed me to be a person
who believed in magic.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.550
A person who believed in hard work, a person
who believed in science, a person who believed

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.270
in how you can create real tangible solutions
towards something that you want, but that

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.730
there can also be a bit of an intangible,
unquantifiable sense of what you're trying

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.730
to do.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.510
There's a way to make room for that, without
losing your stability and your certainness

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.320
on what really matters in the world.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.750
When I finally did realize that my mom was
the one, basically, putting these dollar bills

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.420
under my pillow, it happened at the age of
12.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.290
At an age where I had already started to really
dabble in science, dabble in thinking about

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.030
how to build robots, or entering different
science fairs, and so my frame of the world,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.170
my way of thinking, had already begun to really
form.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.600
I think it just ended up making me the person
who I am today.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.130
Tom: I love that.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.110
As a company, we're making a big bet that
millennials are doing business in a way that

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.020
nobody has done before, and I think that story
really illustrates what I think is happening,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.020
the shift.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.790
15 years ago, when I first got into business,
and you'd go into a board meeting, or you'd

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.970
present to a VC, it was so buttoned up, and
so business like, and everybody would've moved

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.600
their company to Silicon Valley, to be a part
of that, and I get that, right?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.510
That actually makes a lot of sense, but they
were very happy to sort of subvert themselves,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.050
and who they are naturally, to fit in, to
make the world make sense ...

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.050
Jessica: Yeah.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.460
Tom: To maybe overemphasize the science aspect.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.060
What I find fascinating is instead of doing
that, you move to Harlem, and looking at what

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.180
your parents did with the teeth, and seeing
wonderment.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.600
I think what you said was, "I found wonder
in the unknown".

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
Jessica: Yeah.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600
Tom: Talk about that.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.190
I think that's really intriguing.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.410
Jessica: There's several things there, right?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.960
One, there's the concept of getting to know
oneself, and owning that, and then going down

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.410
a path that fits who you are versus kind of
fights against who you are.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.120
Starting first with the last thing that you
brought up, "Wonder in the unknown".

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.990
Yeah, there's just so much excitement in figuring
out how things work for me.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.370
I don't know, whether it's people, or the
things around me.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.250
What stresses me out is not hard work, it's
not knowing what work is going to be involved.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.250
You know?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.890
As soon as I have a process in place, or I
have a framework of how something should be,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.070
so I can build up steps to how I want to address
it, it's not stressful.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.050
Think about, I've been doing this now for
almost 10 years.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:13.420
It's never been really, really intense, or
difficult for me.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.950
It's always been hard, you know, a lot of
work, but because I understand what I'm doing,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.560
I know what I'm doing it for, I know what
I'm fighting for.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.720
I understand the step in terms of what's involved
to make sure that I never lose sight of what

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.030
I'm fighting for.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.150
Everything else is just kind of going through
the motions, the motions that I know to be

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.210
valuable.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.790
That ties back into what you're saying before,
in terms of, choosing to go to Harlem.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.970
Choosing to be as authentic as possible, in
the way we build this company, and seeing

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.310
that, not as something that we were just doing
because it was a nice idea, but because we

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.860
really believe that it is our competitive
advantage.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.220
It is the thing that's going to really catapult
our company to being the first billion dollar

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.550
tech company in Harlem, and one of the most
meaningful tech companies in the world, if

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.300
we keep doing what we have to do.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:15.220
It all goes back this idea of realizing ... Okay,
I am a black girl, with immigrant parents,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.340
who grew up in Poughkeepsie, New York.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.840
Decent schooling, but nothing spectacular.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.970
Was lucky enough to get into a great college,
mostly just because my older sister was one

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.270
of the first people from my high school to
get in there, and she set the path.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.599
She's actually, right over there.

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:35.890
Tom: What's up, sis?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.880
Jessica: Yeah, she set the path where I was
just like ... When you're only two years younger

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.840
than your sister, you're like, "If you can
do it, I can do it".

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.010
It made it real.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.530
It didn't make it too scary.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:53.210
I'm not the classic Silicon Valley CEO.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.970
I think that, for me, I used to believe that,
that meant that I could never really achieve

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.970
what they achieve.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.140
That there were certain parts of the world,
certain levels of success, certain levels

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.950
of business, that were just going to be too
big for me.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.390
It's like, how could I dare say, "I'm going
to run an energy company, that I'm going to

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.140
build wealth for a community.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.930
Who the hell am I?"

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.840
Tom: How did you get over that?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.190
I think most people have that, but they stop
there.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.940
Jessica: The first thing that I did was not
think too far ahead.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.530
The idea was, instead of imagining from day
one, "I want to build an energy company".

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:38.080
It was more imagining, or really envisioning,
"Why am I getting up in the morning?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.360
What's the point of my day?"

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.370
For me, I'm really, really excited by self-actualization.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:55.240
I'm really excited by the idea of figuring
out ways to one, recruit people to be part

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:02.360
of the solution to the world's problems, because
I truly believe that there is, given how complex

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.170
our problems are, there is no one person or
company, that's going to solve all of them.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.310
The only chance in hell that we have is if
as many people as possible are engaged, and

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.500
feel empowered to be part of that solution.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:21.160
I think it's like, how can I then create systems
and products that, I almost want to call them

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.500
domino innovations, like they basically beget
other innovations.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.360
They inspire the right people, to start to
solve the things that I can never imagine

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.710
solving.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:36.270
In doing that, they make that one life that
they're living, that one life that they have,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:42.470
feel like it was worth it, on whatever day
happens to be their last day.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:48.200
That really excites me, especially also, I
think I would add too, recently, wanting very

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.740
much to make sure that little girls who look
like me, believe that they can do anything.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.740
Tom: Yeah.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.480
Jessica: And believe that they can do more
than just media and entertainment, in particular,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.380
and believe in the value of their perspective.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.530
That's what gets me up in the morning.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.480
Everything else, the details, I can push through
that day.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.110
What I found is that, instead of trying to
live a successful life, if you aim to have

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.290
a successful day.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:23.940
If you have 13 out of the 24 hours of your
day, if you won those hours, you won the day.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.631
If you win most of the days in a week, you
won the week.

00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:29.160
We just need a simple majority here, right?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.890
If you win most of the weeks in month, there
you go.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:38.040
Most of the months in a year, most of the
years in a life ...

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.070
Tom: [crosstalk 00:11:37]
Jessica: All of a sudden, look at that, without

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.610
even trying, you've been able to kind of get
somewhere.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.880
The biggest roadblocks for me were in those
big momentous moments then.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.360
Like, getting ready to raise the round, for
example, was one of those big moments where

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:01.010
I realized that, without knowing it, I had
been building a life up to this big leap.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.260
It wasn't about starting there, thinking about
the leaps, thinking about the big momentous

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.310
things that would have to happen.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.640
It's like, you just go hour-by-hour, day-by-day,
week-by-week, month-by-month, year-by-year,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.779
and then all of a sudden, five years into
working on something, I have the opportunity

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:19.080
to raise the largest round any black woman's
raised in history, and I'm afraid.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.660
I'm afraid, despite everything I've gone through
to get there, I'm afraid, and it's because

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.420
I still am just like ... Yo.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.060
I know me and Mark Zuckerberg went to the
same college, but that's about it.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.370
I was on the Step Team, I know he wasn't.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.810
You know what I mean?

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.810
Tom: Shocking.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.810
Jessica: Yeah.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.070
From what I understand, he wasn't.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.240
I don't ... We have a different life.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.150
I know that ultimately these investors are
looking to invest in people that they understand,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.150
right?

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.550
I think, actually, a lot of people, I don't
think I'm special in that.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.390
I think people like to understand things.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:57.510
In the worst of times in my business, if they
don't understand me, then they're not gonna

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.510
understand my decisions.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.410
They're not going to have faith in how I'm
going to get us through this.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.410
Tom: Right.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.050
Jessica: It was, actually, this person who's
currently one of my advisors, works for one

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:14.510
of the top VC's out here on the West Coast,
and he said, without missing a beat, "Jessica,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.050
Mark Zuckerberg could have never invented
the Soccket.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:25.150
It is your life, it is your unique perspective,
it is who you are, that has brought you here.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.800
Anyone who invests in you, is gonna want you
to be who you are.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.660
They're going to have to trust that being
who you are, even if it's different from who

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:39.061
they are, that's going to be the thing that's
going to take this to the next level, no matter

00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:41.020
what".

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.400
I think, for me, that was the critical piece
of advice, right?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.770
We all need someone to say the thing that's
been so obvious, but we've just been, too

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.100
head down to realize.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:00.010
We all have our struggle, regardless of who
we are, whether you're male or female, black,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.420
orange, green, who cares?

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.130
We all have our struggle, and we all have
our privilege.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.839
I consider it a privilege to be born of Nigerian
parents.

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:12.150
Forget Tiger moms, Lion moms!

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.820
I still should be getting my law degree right
now, according to my mom.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.820
You know what I mean?

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.820
Tom: Of course, because you haven't done nearly
enough.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.160
Jessica: Exactly, but that's the push, right?

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.570
That, to me, is privilege, to have parents
who believe in you, irrationally so.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.750
You know?

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.680
I feel privileged to have gone to the schools
I've gone to, right?

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:37.730
In the end, it's about recognizing the value
in our own struggle, being appreciative, and

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.110
aware of our privilege, to we can have empathy
for others, and their experience.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:48.510
We can bridge the gap for them, and then being
able to take all of that, and own it.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.980
Say, "This is who ... " Can we curse?

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.980
Can I curse?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.980
Tom: Go for it.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.980
Let's get crazy.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.980
Jessica: I'll try not to, though.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.140
Tom: Trust me, I'm not gonna try not to, so
jump in, the water's warm.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.340
Jessica: This is who the fuck I am.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.340
Tom: There you go.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.610
Jessica: This is who I am.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.270
Hello, to who you are, and to who you are,
that's great, but this is who the fuck I am.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.270
Tom: Right.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.270
Jessica: Take it, or leave it.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:16.100
I know that no matter what happens, if I stay
who I am, I will feel good about it, at the

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.100
end of the day.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.100
You know?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.560
That's the only thing that's going to be constant
in this ever changing world, especially in

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.550
the start up space, is who I am.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.910
In really meditating on that, and thinking,
"I don't know what's gonna happen with this

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.680
round, I don't know what's gonna happen with
this company, but I do know who I am.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680
Let's double down".

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.100
Most people, they raise money, they get out
of Harlem.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.280
We went to Harlem.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.691
I don't think people really believed it until
I also moved my ass to Harlem, because I don't

00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:44.691
like the commute.

00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:45.730
I'm all about that walk.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.090
I'm all about around the corner walk.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:55.230
We moved the company uptown, I move uptown,
and we immerse ourselves.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:01.320
It was the best decision I made, not just
because again, it reminds us, it's just a

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.339
diverse community.

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:10.120
We're talking about building products for
people of diverse experiences around the world,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.420
and the beauty of Harlem is that you'll meet
seven different types of people on the way

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.110
from the subway, to the office.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.160
They're living their lives in seven different
types of ways.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.830
From your rabbi on 96th, to your barber on
125th, these are experiences that count.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.830
These are voices that are meaningful.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:34.899
Honestly, for us as a team, it's like, "How
can we give back as much as we're getting?

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:41.330
How do we make sure that in being here, we're
promoting urban renewal, and not gentrification?"

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:46.920
We've done things like, we created a 501c3
called, "The Harlem Tech Fund", which is entirely

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.400
designed to figure out how can we help the
legacy members of Harlem be a part of the

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.060
tech conversation, the entrepreneurial and
innovation conversation.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.180
Tom: Tell me about what you think the obligation
of business owners are today?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.490
You've talked pretty eloquently about the
onus that businesses have.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.459
Jessica: I don't know if there's an obligation.

00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:08.900
I don't know if I think that anyone has an
obligation just because they run a business.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.880
I just know that I woudn't get up in the morning,
if it's just about profit.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.750
I want to make sure that on my last day, whatever
day that might be, and maybe this is just

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.360
more primed for me, again, because of my struggles,
because I remember a year when my aunt, my

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.660
uncle, and my grandfather died, just like
that.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.990
I have a younger sister, who died.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.730
You start to realize that there's this life,
and then there isn't because I feel blessed,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:41.800
despite the hardships we may have had as a
family growing up in Poughkeepsie, and making

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.450
sure we'd have enough money to be able to
put ourselves through school, and all these

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.450
different things.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.190
My parents always made sure I had what I needed.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.260
I think, I feel like I've had a great life.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:58.630
I've often felt like, to be honest ... I used
to think that God gave me too much, and that

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.160
he did it by mistake, and that the only way
for him not to notice, is if I just was super

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.920
productive with everything.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.300
"Keep him busy, keep him busy.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.240
Don't look at me over here.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.230
Let me just invent this Soccket.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.230
Don't worry about it.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.370
Go look at LeBron.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.370
He's too tall.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.370
Don't worry".

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.370
You know?

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.910
When you are appreciative, and grateful for
what you have, and the life you have, you

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.930
want to give back, you want to make the most
out of it, and you want to make sure that

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.750
on your last day, you don't have regrets,
because that to me, is the only solution,

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.880
to death is, accepting it.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:40.640
Being 100 percent just focused on profit,
in the end, if you have to look in the mirror,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.770
you have to be with just yourself.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.540
When you close your eyes at night, if that
completes you, dope.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.540
Dope.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.540
You know?

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.900
Tom: That's what I love about what's happening
in business, and the changes that are coming

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.900
now.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.300
I think in many ways, you're really an amazing
example of that, of somebody who refused to

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.640
be anybody but themselves.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.270
I think the quote you gave about not moving
to Silicon Valley was, "I would have to change

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:08.740
who I was in order to survive in Silicon Valley,
and I'm not prepared to do that".

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740
Jessica: Yes.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.740
Tom: I love that.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.420
Then, looking at sort of the business realities
of what it means for you, specifically, to

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.770
be encountering a very diverse population,
that you can do that in Harlem, that's really,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:24.309
really smart to look at it, but you don't
come at being yourself from an obstinate standpoint.

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:25.990
You've already pivoted the company.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.090
Jessica: Yeah.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.980
Tom: Moving from the Soccket, sort of as the
primary vehicle to your more technology.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980
Jessica: Yeah.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.780
Tom: Walk us through that insight.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.350
Walk us through, because here what I think
people need to really understand, and what

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.700
I think is really powerful about you, is being
able to hold these two ideas in your head.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.390
"I'm going to be me" and "I'm gonna listen
to the marketplace".

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:51.570
The ability to do both, is I think, incredibly
liberating, and I think for young entrepreneurs,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.170
especially, to hear that message of, "Yes,
be you.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.240
Yes, you need to know who you are, but you're
gonna run a business, you have to listen to

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240
the market".

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.990
Jessica: I think that the parallels are actually
very similar.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:11.770
Let's say, a startup is ... I don't know,
a young celebrity actor, something like that.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.240
That's how I used to think of the Soccket.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.750
It's just like, super flashy, super amazing,
but are we developing the right way as a business?

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.530
Are we actually asking the right questions
of ourselves to make sure we have the longevity,

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.530
so we're still getting roles when we're, you
know, 37?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:36.460
I think, for me, so when I say, "I know who
I am", I guess, the unsaid portion, though,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:41.860
is like ... For the things I don't know about
myself, I'm open to finding out.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.860
Tom: Right.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:49.200
Jessica: I think the idea is to think about
our lives as a constant research experiment.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.970
Tom: I love that.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:21:00.850
Jessica: Who I thought I was, and what I thought
I wanted when I was 19, is to a certain extent,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:07.610
similar now, but there's also a lot of difference
in the nuances, and the details of the execution.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:13.580
I think, what it is that we all have a core
that is like our soul, that is our kind of

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:19.750
ethos that we're born with, that's our ethical
nature, that we get from our families, and

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:25.870
our friends, and where we grew up that ideally,
and hopefully, it's good.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:31.600
I think that nugget, that's always unchanging,
and you have to figure out who that is, what

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.750
that is inside of you, as soon as possible.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.920
I've always been a very reflective person.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.760
I've always been someone who will ask myself,
every six weeks or so, "Am I happy?"

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.430
It's a really simple thing.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:48.610
It's just like, the answers are either yes,
or no.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.030
You know what I mean?

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:57.490
If it's a no, it's like, okay, am I doing
things that while right now, maybe I'm not

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.650
blissfully happy, are working towards something
that I know will me happy?

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.299
You know what I mean?

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:07.940
Am I generally happy with the idea of the
trade offs that I'm making right now, or that

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.429
I have to deal with, does that make me happy?

00:22:11.429 --> 00:22:14.500
If that's a yes, it's like, "Okay, cool".

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.090
If it's still a no, stop everything.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.370
Nope, this doesn't make sense.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.150
I've always been the kind of person who would
check in.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.570
Again, because I feel like ...
Tom: Do you have a system for that?

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.740
Where you literally just say, "Every morning
I'm gonna ask myself this"?

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.140
Or ...
Jessica: No.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.460
I think there are two systems I really have.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.679
One, is that I like to make a To Do list almost
every single day, except for weekends when

00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:37.820
I just feel like doing nothing.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.820
Tom: Right.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.340
Jessica: Everyone needs rest.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:48.000
Ever since I was 19, I made the mistake freshman
year of college of going in, and having no

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
goals.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.570
Freshman year, I actually did horrible in
class, because I didn't know my goals of what

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.600
I wanted to achieve academically.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.520
I let my body fall apart.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:04.500
I lost myself, and because of that, I realized
that I'm the kind of person who needs to work

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:11.500
to know herself, and consistently keep track
of who she is, and what she needs.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.920
Tom: That's so powerful.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.210
Jessica: Okay, also, the high level, when
they tell you, "Hey, we're gonna need you

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.730
to leave school, because your grades are bad".

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.730
Tom: Wow.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.350
Jessica: And like your Nigerian parents are
like, "So, we're gonna need you to leave our

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.350
home".

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.350
No, they didn't do that.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.350
They didn't do that.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.950
They were just kind of like, it was more just
like the look.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.080
The silent look of disappointment.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.080
It's the worst.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.970
Any Nigerian kid will tell you, I rather get
arrested then have my mom's disappointing

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:34.970
look.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.920
With that, you're like, "Okay, I need a solution".

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.230
So, I started doing two simple things.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.980
One was the check in, which I do just ... It's
more like you can sense.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:49.799
If you take some time to be quiet, you can
sense when you're not in equilibrium, and

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:51.559
that's when you ask.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:52.559
That's it.

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:56.710
Just running, running, running, running, running,
without taking a time to just figure your,

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.740
know where you are, then there's probably
gonna be other symptoms when you're just overeating,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.059
or overdoing this, or not sleeping.

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:07.559
People will be able to tell you, "Yeah, you
don't look balanced", if you asked.

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:09.140
If you asked them.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.100
That's the time to ask yourself, and the second
thing is, a list.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.810
The key thing about that list, and it's always
more than what I could ever reasonably accomplish

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.050
in that day, because I like to push myself.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.790
You always end up accomplishing, still more
than what you think.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.750
I like to never feel satisfied with myself,
and I've been doing those two things for ten

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.750
years.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.750
That's why I'm here.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.750
Tom: I love that.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.640
Yeah, staying unsatisfied is something that
I think a lot of people don't, they don't

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.059
know how to balance that.

00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:38.970
They think if they're unsatisfied, that they'll
be unhappy with themselves, that it's somehow

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.990
corrosive, but really, I find that virtually
everything I've accomplished in my life is

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.920
because I'm always unsatisfied.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.090
Whenever I set a goal, by the time I get to
that goal, I've already set another goal that's

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.090
farther away.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.090
Jessica: Yes.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.090
Tom: I am constantly moving the goal post
myself.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.090
Jessica: Yes.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.280
Tom: Because that keeps me going, it keeps
me hungry, it keeps me pushing, because like

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.260
you, it's not about the money, right?

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.130
The only promise I can make anybody, you're
gonna feel exactly the way you feel today

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.210
about yourself, you will feel, even if you
earned a billion dollars, right?

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.210
Jessica: Yeah.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.210
I agree with that.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.570
Tom: Whatever insecurities you have, all of
it, money can't touch that shit.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.059
Jessica: It's like a black hole that you're
filling with the wrong things.

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:22.059
Again, I try not to be too prescriptive in
what people ... I can only speak for myself,

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:27.780
and what I understand in my limited number
of years on this planet about life, but I

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.270
don't think there's anyone who said on their
deathbed, "I'm so glad I made that billion

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.270
dollars".

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.799
Whatever, I don't think that's the thing.

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:38.260
Tom: I want to push you on that a little bit,
and the reason is, I think a lot about this,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.540
because we've chosen not to have kids, so
I often run the scenario of, when I'm on my

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.900
deathbed, everybody tells me, I'm gonna be
thinking about the people in my life, and

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.470
all of that, so I'm gonna have that moment,
where for sure, I'm gonna be, some part of

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.910
me will wish that I had, had kids.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.090
I can already put myself in that position,
and I can get it, but I don't want to live

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.320
for that moment, right?

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.920
We all have phases, cycles, and things that
we go through, like right now, I will tell

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.270
you, this company would not exist, this Impact
Theory is the deepest reflection of what I

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:11.419
want to do in the world, and it is only possible
at this level, because I made money.

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:12.419
Jessica: Yes.

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:15.720
Tom: If I hadn't made money ... I'm literally
thinking, "Thank God, I made that money",

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.380
because now I'm able to do what my whole life
has been building towards this moment.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:25.310
My whole life is about the reason that I mentioned
Riri Williams in the beginning is I believe

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.000
that there is ...
We are going to usher in a movement where

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.510
people really understand pop mythology and
understand how to become you, because of it.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:36.500
That there is some girl right now, because
of how we're gonna bring things in, and fuel

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.070
that kind of mythology, and all the stuff
that we're gonna wrap around it, that a young

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.260
girl who did not believe that she could become
you, is gonna become you, because she read

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.440
a comic book that really espoused the kind
of philosophy that you've cobbled together

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.450
over the years, to become that.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.910
But, nobody's handed it to them before and
said, "This is real.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.030
Don't read this like a comic book.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.540
Read it like it's real".

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.200
To bring it back, all of that is only possible
because I made the money.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.610
I think there's something more interesting,
I think, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong,

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.350
but I think there's something that's more
interesting that's driving you.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:11.750
There's something more interesting that keeps
you on the sort of compass of who you are,

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:16.450
and who you're becoming, and I want to talk
about your concept of thinking outside the

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:17.450
boundaries, right?

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.450
Jessica: Yeah.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.821
Tom: How did you not let people define you?

00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:25.870
You literally, there's so many boxes people
are trying to cram you in, but you're a real

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:26.870
human.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.870
Jessica: Oh gosh.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.330
Tom: How have you shucked all that off?

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.880
Jessica: It's interesting, right?

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.740
To your first point about needing resources
to accomplish what you want to accomplish.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.280
I think that, that definitely makes sense.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:48.190
I think it goes to the idea of saying, sometimes
you're doing things that are hard, and exhausting,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.740
and not fun, and aren't in the moment making
you happy, but you're fine with it because

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.910
you know why you're doing it, and that's fulfilling.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.740
I think, for me, when I think about everything
I've been through with Uncharted Play, and

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:07.650
all of the work that's still ahead, because
I know that if I am not, I like to call it,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.660
"Snatching economic edges".

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.040
Like, when snatch someone's edges, it's like
with the precision, you're able to snatch

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.450
an edge, and just ... It's a black thing,
but it's like, it's just like, "Ooh.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.450
Gotcha".

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.450
You know what I mean?

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.870
I want to like, there are some people in this
world right now, that I'm just like, "Want

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:24.870
to snatch your edges".

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.870
You know that I mean?

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.010
Especially, in our government right now.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:32.460
I just want to ... But the way to do that,
to me, the way I believe I am most suited

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.350
to do that is economically.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.750
To me, it's like, you know what?

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.080
I can't march.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.880
I can march, but I can't march forever.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.460
I can't, like I'm not that artistic with the
signs.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.669
My signs would be a little lame.

00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:53.001
What I can do is very quietly figure out how
to control the energy systems in the world

00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:55.070
and be able to figure something out.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.070
Tom: Yeah, but that's crazy powerful.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.090
Jessica: The idea there, though, is I don't
think want to just do that because it's like,

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.090
"Oh, great.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.090
Now, I'm powerful.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.090
Now, I don't know.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.090
Now, whoever will like me".

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:09.760
It's more just like, "I can not let the next
generation come into a world where you are

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760
the paradigm.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760
I can not".

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:19.450
There's just something in me, and I think
... Why have I been able to just stay who

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:24.850
I am, and not be trapped, and it's true, I
always kind of bring things back to my parents.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:30.169
What they knew, for sure, was that education,
to them, education was the way out.

00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:31.400
You know?

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.679
That's why I believe that Nigerians collect
degrees.

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:34.910
We just collect them.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.660
It was my older sister who was the one that
said, "Yeah, I'm not gonna take classes over

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.660
the summer.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.850
I'm gonna do an internship".

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.070
They were like, "Internship?"

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.290
She was like, "Internship!"

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.290
You know what I mean?

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.760
I don't know where she got the balls to do
that, but I didn't have to fight for that.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.809
Like, I didn't have to come up with some magical
way to convince them that it's not just education,

00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:56.080
you need experience, you need to understand
x, y, and z.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.520
I came into it with this great opportunity,
and that's the reason why I always think it's

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.950
important for even people who can say, "Listen,
I run a company out of an inner city".

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.600
Or, "I'm a woman".

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.490
Or, "I'm a black person.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.090
I'm the daughter of immigrants".

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.350
I still had the privilege of this.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.330
No one is anywhere without somebody helping
them.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:24.020
We just, we're too quick to tell our stories
without including those people in it.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.720
I think, I'm lucky because there are a lot
of people who have paved the way, who have

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.789
come before me, who had to learn things, and
teach them to me, with a quickness.

00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:40.660
I think, in a weird way, I was able to stay
who I am by being open to learning about who

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.330
I am, from those who had been working to figure
out themselves, as well.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:52.049
I think it takes a certain sense of humility
to be willing to listen to those people, but

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:59.280
also, I think it takes a certain sense of
logic, I guess, and dynamic thinking to realize

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.100
that what they're telling you is simply part
of your full concept of yourself.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.659
Not the all, not the total of it.

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:10.400
That's one thing I think I do pride myself
in being able to do well.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.640
I can hear the advice of a lot of different
people, and say, "Thank you, thank you, thank

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.809
you, this is what I want to do", and I'll
stand by it.

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:21.630
I will never blame someone for my decisions.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.950
I just ... No, it's my life.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.030
Tom: I love that.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.030
I love that.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.260
In fact, I gotta shake your hand.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.260
I love that.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:35.679
That's powerful beyond measure, and most people
get tripped up in ... Yeah, being able to

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:39.582
take ownership for your mistakes, especially
and say, "Look, this was my choice.

00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:40.890
I made it".

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.100
It keeps you in the driver's seat, which is
why I'm so obsessed with it.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.950
You have this concept called "Thinking out
of bounds".

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.650
How do you teach people how to do that?

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.659
Jessica: Yeah.

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:55.920
"Thinking out of bounds" came from this idea,
when people would ask me, back when we first

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.370
started out, creating energy generating sports
products.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.760
Now we're creating infrastructure level energy
systems that could harness power from motion.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.960
Tom: That's so cool.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.040
Jessica: Everything from floor panels, to
furniture, to power lighting systems and WiFi,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.070
but where we started was just with a soccer
ball.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:21.910
Being Nigerian, pulling from the experiences
I had in Nigeria with my cousins, and a lot

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:27.049
of people asked me when it first came out,
"How do think that out of the box?

00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:28.559
How did you get this idea?

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.900
How did you make this thing happen?"

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.760
It's funny because I would say, "I didn't
even know what the parameters of the box were.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.049
I didn't know this was a box.

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:39.070
I am not a trained engineer."

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.430
The unfortunate thing, I think, sometimes
about the way engineering is taught, is that

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:54.000
you're kind of pushed to scare yourself away
from the bounds of what might be impossible.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
You are afraid.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.440
You're taught to be afraid to be wrong.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.340
That I know, so you will do anything you can
to make sure you're right, which is awesome,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.710
and you see this amazing work ethic, and this
amazing precision, in the way engineers will

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.620
build things, but god forbid they say something
that's wrong and I'm happy to be wrong.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.620
I'll say something like, "Blah".

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.630
I'll be like, "The sky is green".

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.630
"No, it's not".

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.630
Okay.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.630
Good to know.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.320
I thought it was green, moving on.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.559
Just in case it is green, "Hey, the sky is
green today!

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.559
Look at that!

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:23.280
Look who said the sky was green!"

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.740
That ability, that freedom to just kind of
fluidly be comfortable with your thoughts,

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.559
whether they're right, or wrong, because as
long as you're coming from a place of logic,

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:33.059
hey what's [crosstalk 00:33:32]
Tom: Can you teach people that?

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:36.980
Can you give them the confidence to not be
afraid of being wrong?

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.430
Jessica: We're trying to.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.030
We have this really cool curriculum called,
"Think Out of Bounds", and it's actually something

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.539
we distribute when we're distributing our
soccer balls, and our jump ropes.

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:51.670
It's designed to teach people how to invent
with limited resources.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:55.740
The idea is, how could you build someone's
creative confidence?

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.600
Ultimately, thinking out of bounds, it's about
creatively working outside of the realm of

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.659
what is known, out of the realm of what's
proven, out of the realm of what you believe

00:34:05.659 --> 00:34:07.870
to be right.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:14.039
Considering things like that in a very flexible
way, the older someone is, usually the harder

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:15.039
it is.

00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:16.629
Tom: Because they're more dogmatic?

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:21.019
Jessica: Yeah, they're more just kind of like,
"Listen, my life experiences have told me

00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:22.019
x".

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:23.019
You know?

00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:24.019
Tom: Right.

00:34:24.019 --> 00:34:25.019
Jessica: Actually, let me rephrase that.

00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:27.489
It's usually not their "life experiences",
it's usually what they've read.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:33.789
I'll go to an electrical engineer, and I'll
say, "I know that a diode needs to be here,

00:34:33.789 --> 00:34:36.529
but entertain me here, what if we don't put
one in?"

00:34:36.529 --> 00:34:38.919
They'll be like, you'll see them like, "It's
impossible!"

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:40.249
You know what I mean?

00:34:40.249 --> 00:34:41.839
I'm just like, "But, is it?

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:43.169
Have you ever tried it?

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:44.230
You know, let's see".

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.429
I'll say those things that you can tell they're
just like, "Is this ... She's crazy.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:48.649
Our CEO is fucking crazy".

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:51.129
I'm just like, "Yeah, well, you took the job.

00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:54.369
You should have known what you were getting
into to".

00:34:54.369 --> 00:34:57.070
You'll start to push them, and you'll see
it.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.219
I'm like, "Listen, if you can take the knowledge
you have, and then be willing to kind of play

00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:02.410
a little bit outside the bounds".

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:03.519
The key is kind of step-by-step, though.

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:06.470
Tom: I'm gonna ask you a question, because
I have experienced this so many times.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.069
I am so with you.

00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:12.730
How do you approach it when it's you on that
end, and somebody comes to you with a crazy

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:13.730
idea?

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.349
What do you do mentally, internally, to be
open to that?

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:17.349
Or, are you open to that?

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:21.750
Jessica: I think the first thing I try to
do is just the thing I was mentioning earlier,

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:27.309
where instead of what I've been told to be
true, or what I've read to be true, I first

00:35:27.309 --> 00:35:30.569
say, "Do I have any personal experiences that
I'm just like almost in my gut?"

00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:33.819
It's almost like you have to fight the intangible
with the intangible.

00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:39.519
In my gut, here's why I just don't believe
that makes any sense.

00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:45.529
Then, we have a really interesting kind of,
I don't want to call a "pastime", but I guess

00:35:45.529 --> 00:35:51.109
for the sake of having another word, a pastime
in my company where I'm always saying, "Listen,

00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:52.289
conflict.

00:35:52.289 --> 00:35:53.289
Fight back.

00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:57.490
I'm saying this, put together your thoughts,
logically, and come back at me.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.150
I want you to convince me that I'm wrong.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.569
Find the holes in my argument.

00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:04.009
Find the gap in my thinking".

00:36:04.009 --> 00:36:07.549
We'll go, I like to go toe-to-toe.

00:36:07.549 --> 00:36:12.019
I think, for me, what I personally do, in
general, to be open to these things is like

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:13.430
... This is gonna sound really weird.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:17.210
I'm very wary of knowing too much about any
one thing.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.930
Tom: That is really fascinating.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:25.150
Jessica: I will know enough, so that I can
execute, if I have to, so that I can manage

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:29.770
someone in that space, so I can advise that
person in that space, but I am very wary of

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.980
becoming so obsessed about one specific thing.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.069
Tom: Why?

00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:39.749
Jessica: Because when you know too much, it's
hard to distinguish between your personal

00:36:39.749 --> 00:36:41.790
feelings about something, and what you've
read.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:47.779
You will take what you've learned, and it
will absorb you and become your way of thinking.

00:36:47.779 --> 00:36:53.269
It will overly encompass your way of thinking,
and they'll be no space for that weird, "Could

00:36:53.269 --> 00:36:56.930
the sky be green" question, because your mind
is full of the facts.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:02.420
I try to leave enough space where I could
just fill it with nonsense, and that nonsense

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.670
is inspiring to me.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.670
That's hard.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.910
Again, engineers, they have to take so many
classes, they have to do so many hours of

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.380
studying, so they end up pushing ... They
barely have enough space for that information,

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.780
to say the least, to have 10 percent space
for nonsense.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:23.079
Yeah, it can be hard, but when you start at
a younger age with someone, they're able to

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:24.960
figure out how to always leave room for that.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.799
It goes back to the story about the Tooth
Fairy.

00:37:27.799 --> 00:37:32.559
My parents left a little space for the story
about the Tooth Fairy, and so I'm able to

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:37.069
learn a lot about a lot of things, and still
be like, "But, also the Tooth Fairy can exist".

00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:40.630
That, I feel so lucky that I had that experience.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.719
Tom: God, I really hope people are listening
to you right now because there's this really

00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:49.420
cool concept that you're putting wonderful
words around, which is an expert is somebody

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.880
who can tell you exactly how things can't
be done.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880
Jessica: Yeah.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.920
Tom: I have that same fear that you have of
becoming that expert, of thinking I know so

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.440
much, that I don't stay open.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.319
One of the questions that I wrote down for
you, that we're already talking about.

00:38:03.319 --> 00:38:04.849
Your company is so innovative.

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.049
Jessica: Thank you.

00:38:06.049 --> 00:38:08.940
Tom: Jesus, it speaks for itself.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.890
How you keep an open mind?

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.589
How you train your staff to keep an open mind?

00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:18.880
I love that it's something as playful as the
Tooth Fairy, and look, I get it.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.359
You've really brought it back down to Earth,
with what's actually going on, which is leaving

00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:28.309
yourself open, and the wonderment of not knowing,
but it's been formalized.

00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:30.200
Jessica: People will be afraid.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.480
Uncertainty is scary.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.099
New information is scary.

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:37.599
Change is scary.

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:38.960
Everyone has a different way of handling that.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960
[crosstalk 00:38:40]
Tom: How do you manage change?

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.200
Your company has been through some pretty
radical change.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.069
Jessica: Yeah, in the company, I will pivot
when necessary.

00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:48.390
I'm like, "Dead end".

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.829
Do what you got to do.

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:55.229
I can take new information and adjust the
plan immediately, and have no qualms about

00:38:55.229 --> 00:38:57.509
it, and just move, move, move.

00:38:57.509 --> 00:39:03.500
The way to balance that is that outside of
work, I really like things to be stable.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.849
I like to date nice guys.

00:39:05.849 --> 00:39:07.410
I've never been attracted to the "Bad Boy".

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.789
Why in the hell do I want to be with the bad
boy?

00:39:10.789 --> 00:39:11.789
Why?

00:39:11.789 --> 00:39:12.789
He's like, "I don't know if I'm gonna call
you".

00:39:12.789 --> 00:39:13.789
Bye!

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:15.589
I want the dude who's like, "Here's some flowers".

00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:16.660
Thank you, honey.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.660
You know?

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.660
"Let's go to the movies".

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:19.660
No problem.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.660
"Are we too boring?"

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.660
Nope, we are not too boring.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.660
This is wonderful.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.660
This is everything.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.200
I like stability in those ways.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.089
Everyone has their thing, and that's what
helps me.

00:39:31.089 --> 00:39:32.089
You do need to have a balance.

00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:33.799
You do need to have something that you can
count on.

00:39:33.799 --> 00:39:39.589
You need to have that pole, that you can go
back to when everything looks crazy, that

00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:43.380
you can reach out to, to hold on to.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.049
Yeah, that's how it works for me.

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:53.099
If I didn't have that, I think I'd be much
more afraid of chaos at work.

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:54.099
Tom: All right.

00:39:54.099 --> 00:40:02.299
For somebody who likes stability outside of
work, why do you box?

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.640
Jessica: Oh.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640
Okay.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.230
There's like the feminist answer, and then
there's the nerdy answer, and they're both

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.230
true.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.230
Tom: All right.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.230
Let's hear them both.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.259
Jessica: From the feminist answer, I like
to be strong.

00:40:12.259 --> 00:40:13.259
Tom: Respect.

00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:14.380
Jessica: I like to be strong.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:19.799
I like to, I believe in mental strength, spiritual
strength, and physical strength.

00:40:19.799 --> 00:40:22.900
I think a lot of women don't lift weights,
and I don't know why, because it lifts your

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.930
ass, which is awesome, okay?

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.079
Do your squats.

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:27.170
Do your squats!

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.170
There.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.459
Tom: Right to the camera.

00:40:30.459 --> 00:40:31.459
I love it.

00:40:31.459 --> 00:40:32.459
Jessica: You know?

00:40:32.459 --> 00:40:33.900
It's just, it's dope.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.839
When you live in the city, you got to carry
your groceries.

00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:43.339
Before all of the delivery things, you had
to carry your groceries to your home.

00:40:43.339 --> 00:40:46.329
That alone, made you want to get into the
gym.

00:40:46.329 --> 00:40:50.869
It's like, "What weight is seven bags from
[crosstalk 00:40:50]?

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:52.369
You know what I mean?

00:40:52.369 --> 00:40:56.490
You want to make sure you can carry that.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.770
I like to be functional.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.420
I like to have functional strength.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.980
It's kind of fun to think about also, when
you're in a world where bad things happen

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:13.880
to women, to know that, "All right, I don't
know what's gonna happen ... " I want to look

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.489
like, if a predator is walking by, I want
him to be like, "I don't know if I'm gonna

00:41:17.489 --> 00:41:18.680
win this fight", and just walk by.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.440
I want him to look at me, and be like, "This
is a tossup", and just keep walking.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.440
"Exactly!"

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.440
You know what I mean?

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.549
That, I think, is fun.

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:36.219
From the nerdy side of it, though, there was
something, the idea of being a ninja, or like

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:38.029
a superhero ...
Tom: Oh, yes, my friend.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:39.969
Jessica: Always just seemed really cool.

00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:45.670
You'd watch these movies, and just see people
do these dope things, and you're just like,

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.579
"That's cool.

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:49.459
That's exciting".

00:41:49.459 --> 00:41:53.700
Yeah, so learning a skill, like kind of felt
fun.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.651
I like developing skills ...
Tom: I like that.

00:41:55.651 --> 00:42:01.500
Jessica: That really expanded my mind, and
expand the way I can use my body, and I had

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.059
never done this before.

00:42:03.059 --> 00:42:04.609
My mom would have never let me.

00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:08.809
I think that the third thing for me too, is
that I realize that boxing is actually a really

00:42:08.809 --> 00:42:12.140
great analogy for business.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.910
Boxing is inherently reactive, and active.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:20.009
You have to have your strategy, but constantly
be realizing that your strategy will change

00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:25.730
in the manner of a second, because once you've
done one thing, they've now adjusted, and

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.279
are about to make everything you want to do,
it's almost like chess, in a weird way.

00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:31.009
Tom: Where the pieces, punch him in the face.

00:42:31.009 --> 00:42:34.259
Jessica: Where the pieces are the punches,
which I think is better because running a

00:42:34.259 --> 00:42:35.990
startup is painful.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.880
It's painful when you're sleeping on the floor.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.609
It's not chess, it's boxing, right?

00:42:42.609 --> 00:42:46.269
For me, when I think about where we're going
into business now, playing in very dynamic

00:42:46.269 --> 00:42:52.369
industries, very scary big industries, I can't
just have my plan, be like, "Here's my plan

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:53.369
for 2017".

00:42:53.369 --> 00:42:59.739
It's like, "Here's my strategy for 2017, and
I am prepared to do what it takes to stay

00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:00.999
alive".

00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:04.180
What I tell my investors is, "All you need
to know is that I will be standing at the

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.390
end of this match".

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.390
That's it.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:12.019
If I have to, all of a sudden, do an uppercut
that I've never done, or switch to southpaw,

00:43:12.019 --> 00:43:15.869
out of nowhere ... Hey, I'll do what I have
to do because I'm gonna win this fight.

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:20.619
In the end, say whatever you want to say about
someone's fighting style, if they won, they

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:21.619
won.

00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:22.619
You know what I mean?

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:24.950
That's what I love about boxing.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:32.809
It's not only that it requires you to think
on your feet, and also be very light on your

00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:33.809
feet, very delicate.

00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:38.170
If you plant your feet, and you come around
you, it's just like if you plant yourself

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:42.359
in your ideas about your business, you will
lose.

00:43:42.359 --> 00:43:45.700
When you do make that mistake, you feel the
pain.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.840
You don't just think about the pain, you feel
it.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.840
Yeah, it's cool.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.840
Tom: It's awesome.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.840
Jessica: It's cool.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.430
Tom: That's a great answer.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.989
I have one more question, but before that,
where can these guys find you online?

00:43:56.989 --> 00:43:59.519
Jessica: You can go to U-PLAY.CO.

00:43:59.519 --> 00:44:03.690
U-Dash-P-L-A-Y dot C-O.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:08.859
You'll see all the stuff that we've been doing
with what we like to call our "Legacy products".

00:44:08.859 --> 00:44:12.770
Like how we're actually working to uplift
one million kids around the world over the

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.069
next four years ...
Tom: That's amazing.

00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:18.390
Jessica: By using our "Think Out Of Bounds"
curriculum, and our Soccket ball, and our

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:23.809
energy generating jump rope, The Pulse, to
inspire one million students from income poor

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:27.509
communities, to realize that they are the
future.

00:44:27.509 --> 00:44:30.380
They're going to be the next Einstein, and
backing those ideas.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:36.960
If you go to U-More.co, that's M-O-R-E dot
C-O, you'll learn about the core technology

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.650
that's inside of the soccer ball, and the
jump rope, and that we're using to bring power

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.980
to communities across Africa, and soon, all
around the world.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.470
Everything from flooring, to furniture.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.829
That's the two big ones.

00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:55.469
If you want to find me, and just follow my
random life on Instagram, you can find me

00:44:55.469 --> 00:44:56.469
@JESSOMATT.

00:44:56.469 --> 00:44:57.469
J-E-S-S-O-M-A-T-T.

00:44:57.469 --> 00:45:03.809
Yeah, you can find me Instagram, Twitter,
I do random stuff on Facebook sometimes, just

00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:04.989
Google me that way.

00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:05.989
Yeah, no.

00:45:05.989 --> 00:45:09.609
We try to keep it real, or you could just
come to Harlem.

00:45:09.609 --> 00:45:11.150
You'll probably see us walking around.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:12.170
I'm always walking around.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.170
Yeah.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.170
Tom: "Just come to Harlem".

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.170
That is the best answer anyone's ever given.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.170
Jessica: Come to Harlem.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.170
Harlem's not that big.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.170
Just be like, "Hey, where's that energy company
at?"

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.329
One of them will be like, "Over there".

00:45:21.329 --> 00:45:22.329
Tom: Nice.

00:45:22.329 --> 00:45:23.329
Jessica: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:24.329
Tom: All right.

00:45:24.329 --> 00:45:25.329
Last question.

00:45:25.329 --> 00:45:29.969
What's the impact that you want to have on
the world.

00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:36.880
Jessica: For me, the impact I want to have
on the world.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:43.859
I know ... For me, when I all started this
whole thing, what really kind of originally

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:46.829
drove me, was really about self-actualization.

00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:51.910
Creating systems and products that streamlined
the way people could self-actualize in their

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:53.250
lives.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.660
Making the journey as valuable as the end
result.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.599
That's something that's still really huge
for me.

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:07.380
Like, how can we make sure people have just
really happy, fulfilling lives.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:11.660
I think, more specifically now, given a lot
of the things that have happened in this world,

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.259
over the last few years.

00:46:13.259 --> 00:46:16.219
Rather, a lot of the things that have been
brought to light.

00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:20.719
They might have always been happening.

00:46:20.719 --> 00:46:30.589
I hate feeling, there are some things, no
matter how much you believe in yourself, that

00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:32.210
just suck, especially when you're a black
woman.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:42.869
They just really ... For example, it sucks
feeling like no matter who you hire, because

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:47.769
you're a young black woman, they're going
to ask you things that they would never ask

00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:49.729
an older white guy for.

00:46:49.729 --> 00:46:50.729
There's no respect.

00:46:50.729 --> 00:46:51.729
I feel like Rodney Dangerfield.

00:46:51.729 --> 00:46:52.729
I can't get no respect.

00:46:52.729 --> 00:46:54.430
You know what I mean?

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.930
Hey, I'm born in '88, I can still make that
reference!

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.769
Tom: I was gonna say, that's impressive.

00:46:59.769 --> 00:47:00.829
Jessica: Yep.

00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:05.040
When you think, okay, let me hire people then
that look like me.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.469
We as black women, we as women, are not awesome
to each other.

00:47:08.469 --> 00:47:10.569
Girl, Hillary knows.

00:47:10.569 --> 00:47:12.700
Hillary knows.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.299
People just ... Black women came to vote for
you, though.

00:47:16.299 --> 00:47:20.579
We came out.

00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:21.579
It sucks.

00:47:21.579 --> 00:47:22.579
It's hard.

00:47:22.579 --> 00:47:26.459
It's one of those things where it's like,
we live in a world that's so complicated that

00:47:26.459 --> 00:47:31.450
it's not enough to just say, one of us succeeded,
or there's one example.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:37.961
It's going to take so many different things
happening to really shift the way we, not

00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:41.390
only learn how to love each other, but learn
how to love ourselves.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.390
You know what I mean?

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:50.529
Like, as women, as women of color, as black
women.

00:47:50.529 --> 00:47:56.410
I want to make a significant step forward
in that direction.

00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:04.259
I want my daughter to enter a world where
she doesn't even have to explain, "I know

00:48:04.259 --> 00:48:06.959
I'm different, but here's my competitive advantage".

00:48:06.959 --> 00:48:11.850
If there's a pattern matching, that people
are looking for, in the tech space, they're

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.819
looking for either a Mark Zuckerberg, or a
Jessica Matthews.

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:17.520
Then she could just come out and be like,
"Yup.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.520
Duh.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.520
Obviously".

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.520
You know what I mean?

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.520
That would be awesome.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:27.069
I want it to be that like when I'm flying
through, if I'm flying first class, people

00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:29.810
aren't assuming I'm Venus or Serena.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:30.810
That's it.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.209
It's just like, literally, they'd be like,
"I thought you were Venus, but I know you're

00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:36.529
not, so what is it that you do?"

00:48:36.529 --> 00:48:38.829
When you tell them an energy company, they're
just like ...

00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:39.829
Tom: Right.

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:41.289
Jessica: You know what I mean?

00:48:41.289 --> 00:48:43.289
I want it to be like, "Ah, indeed.

00:48:43.289 --> 00:48:44.750
Like Jessica Matthews, of course.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.750
Of course".

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.160
There's more that we can do than that.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:56.219
I just, I want to expand the way we think
about black women.

00:48:56.219 --> 00:48:59.619
I mean, that's all, and what we think young
women can do.

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:07.569
What we think people on the East Coast can
do, because it sucks.

00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:08.569
It's exhausting.

00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:12.579
It adds this unsaid level of weight.

00:49:12.579 --> 00:49:13.579
You know?

00:49:13.579 --> 00:49:19.719
Unspoken level of weight on my shoulders,
and the shoulders of a lot of my peers that

00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:24.720
it does slow us down, and it is exhausting,
and it is heavy.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.880
No matter how many weights I lift to make
sure I can carry that, in addition to my bags

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.029
from the grocery store, I still prefer not
to.

00:49:34.029 --> 00:49:36.759
If I can make, like a step forward in that.

00:49:36.759 --> 00:49:41.239
If I can really, just again, building on what's
already been done from the people ahead of

00:49:41.239 --> 00:49:44.500
me to do that, that would be so dope.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.319
It would just be the dopest.

00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:47.319
Honestly.

00:49:47.319 --> 00:49:50.819
Tom: Jessica, thank you, so much for coming
on.

00:49:50.819 --> 00:49:52.170
Jessica: Thank you.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.969
Tom: That was incredible.

00:49:53.969 --> 00:49:57.430
Guys, this woman is gonna take you places
that you can't even imagine.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.739
You're gonna want to look her up in the places
that she told you about.

00:50:00.739 --> 00:50:05.559
She is doing something on an infrastructure
level, that I want you guys to really understand.

00:50:05.559 --> 00:50:08.109
This is not somebody that dove into the obvious
business.

00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:11.999
This is somebody who looked at the world,
and said, "I can do the infrastructure better.

00:50:11.999 --> 00:50:13.450
The things that are invisible.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.720
Those are the things that I can, and will
do better".

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.250
To have that gumption at her age is miraculous.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.829
To have it at any age is spectacular.

00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:26.950
To be able to do it so young, and to have
defied so many definitions that the world

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:31.380
has tried to put on her, and to see her shuck
that off, I think she's gonna be taking steps

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.759
to expand a lot more worlds than maybe she's
even aiming at right now because that is the

00:50:35.759 --> 00:50:40.699
incredible power that I see in her, and her
willingness to center herself, and who she

00:50:40.699 --> 00:50:41.699
is.

00:50:41.699 --> 00:50:44.190
Not only who she is today, but who she wants
to become.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:48.609
To let her companies reflect that, to be as
nimble as she is, to be able to go into the

00:50:48.609 --> 00:50:54.300
center of Harlem, and say, "We're gonna build
the first billion dollar tech company here",

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.959
is absolutely incredible.

00:50:55.959 --> 00:50:59.680
I hope to one day be as brave as this woman.

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.280
It's been an absolute honor to have her on
the show.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.849

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.940
Jessica: Thank you.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.940
Tom: Best of luck.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.170
Thank you, for coming on.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.380
