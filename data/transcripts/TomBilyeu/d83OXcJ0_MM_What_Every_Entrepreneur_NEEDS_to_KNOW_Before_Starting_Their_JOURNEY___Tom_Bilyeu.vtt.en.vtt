00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
it is just a guess
 

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.430 align:start position:0%

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
then you're going to actually formulate
 

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
then you're going to actually formulate

00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
and run an experiment
 

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:58.790 align:start position:0%

it's<00:14:57.360><c> going</c><00:14:57.440><c> to</c><00:14:57.519><c> be</c><00:14:57.600><c> something</c><00:14:58.000><c> that</c><00:14:58.160><c> you</c><00:14:58.399><c> can</c>

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be something that you can
 

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.670 align:start position:0%
it's going to be something that you can
do

00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%

should<00:17:50.080><c> we</c><00:17:50.160><c> have</c><00:17:50.400><c> on</c><00:17:50.960><c> here's</c><00:17:51.280><c> my</c><00:17:51.440><c> best</c><00:17:51.760><c> guess</c>

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
should we have on here's my best guess
 

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.590 align:start position:0%
should we have on here's my best guess
so<00:17:52.559><c> we</c><00:17:52.720><c> should</c><00:17:52.960><c> go</c><00:17:53.120><c> into</c><00:17:53.520><c> xyz</c><00:17:54.160><c> space</c><00:17:54.880><c> uh</c><00:17:55.360><c> okay</c>

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
so we should go into xyz space uh okay
 

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.789 align:start position:0%
so we should go into xyz space uh okay
that<00:17:55.760><c> didn't</c><00:17:55.919><c> work</c><00:17:56.080><c> we</c><00:17:56.240><c> should</c><00:17:56.400><c> try</c><00:17:56.640><c> this</c>

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
that didn't work we should try this
 

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
that didn't work we should try this
