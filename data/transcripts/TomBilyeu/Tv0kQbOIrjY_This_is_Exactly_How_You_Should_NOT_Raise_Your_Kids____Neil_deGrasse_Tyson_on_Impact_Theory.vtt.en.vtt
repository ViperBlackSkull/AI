condense<00:14:08.000><c> out</c><00:14:08.160><c> of</c><00:14:08.240><c> that</c><00:14:08.399><c> so</c><00:14:08.639><c> they</c>

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
condense out of that so they
 

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.949 align:start position:0%
condense out of that so they

so

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
what you can do is you can come in
 

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
what you can do is you can come in

so

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%

you gain the orbital speed of the planet

you gain the orbital speed of the planet
