and so if the animals are isolated it
 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.510 align:start position:0%

one of the best models for looking at

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
so if you isolate almost almost any

they will be more violent when you
 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.029 align:start position:0%
they will be more violent when you

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
introduce them back with another member
 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
introduce them back with another member

that's<00:07:06.960><c> weird</c><00:07:07.599><c> so</c><00:07:07.919><c> what</c><00:07:08.080><c> was</c><00:07:08.319><c> it</c><00:07:08.560><c> um</c><00:07:09.280><c> what</c><00:07:09.520><c> was</c>

spend as much time with them do you know
like<00:09:27.440><c> are</c><00:09:27.600><c> we</c><00:09:27.920><c> seeing</c><00:09:28.240><c> just</c><00:09:28.399><c> the</c><00:09:28.880><c> the</c><00:09:29.279><c> um</c>

like are we seeing just the the um
 

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.389 align:start position:0%
like are we seeing just the the um
receptors<00:09:30.480><c> for</c><00:09:30.720><c> oxytocin</c><00:09:31.600><c> are</c><00:09:31.839><c> disappearing</c>

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
receptors for oxytocin are disappearing
 

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:35.110 align:start position:0%

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
off the cells like yeah why yeah that's
 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.710 align:start position:0%
off the cells like yeah why yeah that's
a<00:09:35.279><c> great</c><00:09:35.519><c> question</c>

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease in isolation it's
 

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease in isolation it's

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
increased after isolation and it's kind
 

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
increased after isolation and it's kind
of<00:11:31.040><c> and</c><00:11:31.120><c> what</c><00:11:31.279><c> do</c><00:11:31.360><c> we</c><00:11:31.519><c> think</c><00:11:31.760><c> the</c><00:11:32.160><c> the</c><00:11:32.399><c> point</c><00:11:32.640><c> of</c>

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
of and what do we think the the point of
 

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.389 align:start position:0%
of and what do we think the the point of
that<00:11:33.120><c> what</c><00:11:33.360><c> what's</c><00:11:33.600><c> it</c><00:11:33.760><c> pointing</c><00:11:34.079><c> at</c><00:11:34.160><c> yeah</c>

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
that what what's it pointing at yeah
 

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.870 align:start position:0%
that what what's it pointing at yeah
that's<00:11:34.560><c> a</c><00:11:34.640><c> good</c><00:11:34.880><c> point</c><00:11:35.200><c> so</c><00:11:35.760><c> i</c><00:11:36.079><c> i</c><00:11:36.240><c> think</c><00:11:36.720><c> you</c>

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good point so i i think you
 

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.710 align:start position:0%
that's a good point so i i think you
know<00:11:37.040><c> there's</c><00:11:37.279><c> a</c><00:11:37.360><c> few</c><00:11:37.519><c> ways</c><00:11:37.839><c> of</c><00:11:37.920><c> looking</c><00:11:38.240><c> at</c><00:11:38.399><c> it</c>

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
know there's a few ways of looking at it
 

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
know there's a few ways of looking at it
one<00:11:38.959><c> is</c><00:11:39.120><c> that</c><00:11:39.279><c> it's</c><00:11:39.519><c> kind</c><00:11:39.680><c> of</c><00:11:39.839><c> acting</c><00:11:40.399><c> in</c><00:11:40.560><c> this</c>

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
one is that it's kind of acting in this
 

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
one is that it's kind of acting in this
kind<00:11:41.760><c> of</c><00:11:42.000><c> coordinated</c><00:11:42.560><c> manner</c><00:11:43.200><c> much</c><00:11:43.440><c> like</c>

kind of coordinated manner much like
 

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.230 align:start position:0%

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.190 align:start position:0%
whole orchestra by his you know
direction<00:11:49.600><c> and</c><00:11:49.839><c> so</c><00:11:50.160><c> you</c><00:11:50.399><c> see</c><00:11:50.560><c> it</c><00:11:50.640><c> elevated</c><00:11:51.040><c> in</c>

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.790 align:start position:0%

the behaviors that we're seeing on the

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
conducting some gnarly stubs right um so
 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%

we have

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing and i think that
 

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing and i think that

would that definitely requires kind of

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%

earlier in the interview there's you
 

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.789 align:start position:0%
earlier in the interview there's you

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
know lots of tools that let you look at
 

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
know lots of tools that let you look at

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
comb and so because of that people have
 

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.549 align:start position:0%
comb and so because of that people have
started<00:18:24.559><c> to</c><00:18:24.720><c> find</c><00:18:25.440><c> different</c><00:18:25.840><c> subregions</c><00:18:26.480><c> of</c>

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
started to find different subregions of

started to find different subregions of

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
the amygdala so you know
 

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.190 align:start position:0%

like<00:18:46.880><c> that</c><00:18:47.200><c> so</c>

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
like that so
 

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
like that so
um<00:18:48.400><c> that's</c><00:18:48.720><c> come</c><00:18:48.880><c> a</c><00:18:48.960><c> long</c><00:18:49.200><c> way</c><00:18:49.679><c> what</c><00:18:50.080><c> what's</c>

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
um that's come a long way what what's
 

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.549 align:start position:0%
um that's come a long way what what's
the<00:18:50.559><c> part</c><00:18:50.880><c> that</c><00:18:51.120><c> decreases</c><00:18:51.840><c> fear</c><00:18:52.160><c> and</c><00:18:52.240><c> how</c><00:18:52.400><c> do</c>

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
the part that decreases fear and how do
 

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.230 align:start position:0%
the part that decreases fear and how do
we<00:18:52.640><c> take</c><00:18:52.880><c> control</c><00:18:53.280><c> of</c><00:18:53.360><c> that</c><00:18:53.520><c> right</c><00:18:53.840><c> so</c><00:18:54.000><c> this</c>

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
we take control of that right so this
 

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.390 align:start position:0%
we take control of that right so this
actually<00:18:54.559><c> it's</c><00:18:54.720><c> the</c><00:18:54.880><c> same</c><00:18:55.200><c> part</c><00:18:55.600><c> so</c>

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually it's the same part so
 

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
actually it's the same part so
kind<00:18:56.559><c> of</c><00:18:56.720><c> more</c><00:18:56.880><c> recently</c><00:18:57.200><c> people</c><00:18:57.520><c> started</c>

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
kind of more recently people started
 

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.510 align:start position:0%

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even say more recently maybe
 

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even say more recently maybe

so<00:19:48.960><c> now</c><00:19:49.280><c> walk</c><00:19:49.520><c> me</c><00:19:49.679><c> through</c><00:19:50.000><c> how</c><00:19:50.320><c> so</c><00:19:51.039><c> um</c>

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
so now walk me through how so um
 

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.870 align:start position:0%
so now walk me through how so um
if<00:19:52.559><c> you</c><00:19:52.720><c> had</c><00:19:52.880><c> asked</c><00:19:53.039><c> me</c><00:19:53.200><c> when</c><00:19:53.360><c> i</c><00:19:53.440><c> was</c><00:19:53.600><c> 18</c>

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
if you had asked me when i was 18
 

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.150 align:start position:0%
if you had asked me when i was 18
about<00:19:55.200><c> fear</c><00:19:55.440><c> i</c><00:19:55.520><c> probably</c><00:19:55.760><c> would</c><00:19:55.919><c> have</c><00:19:56.000><c> said</c>

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
about fear i probably would have said
 

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
about fear i probably would have said
yeah<00:19:56.559><c> if</c><00:19:56.720><c> i</c><00:19:56.799><c> could</c><00:19:56.960><c> get</c><00:19:57.200><c> rid</c><00:19:57.440><c> of</c><00:19:57.520><c> it</c><00:19:57.679><c> totally</c><00:19:58.160><c> i</c>

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah if i could get rid of it totally i
 

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
yeah if i could get rid of it totally i
would

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
would
 

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.870 align:start position:0%
would
um<00:19:59.440><c> and</c><00:19:59.600><c> then</c><00:19:59.840><c> i</c><00:20:00.000><c> read</c><00:20:00.160><c> a</c><00:20:00.320><c> study</c><00:20:00.640><c> about</c>

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and then i read a study about
 

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.470 align:start position:0%
um and then i read a study about

incredibly interesting and it's like if
 

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
incredibly interesting and it's like if
you<00:23:54.320><c> translate</c><00:23:54.880><c> psychogenic</c><00:23:55.600><c> and</c><00:23:55.679><c> let</c><00:23:55.760><c> me</c>

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
you translate psychogenic and let me
 

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.950 align:start position:0%
you translate psychogenic and let me
know<00:23:55.919><c> if</c><00:23:56.000><c> you</c><00:23:56.080><c> agree</c><00:23:56.320><c> with</c><00:23:56.400><c> this</c><00:23:56.720><c> if</c><00:23:56.799><c> you</c>

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
know if you agree with this if you
 

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.549 align:start position:0%
know if you agree with this if you
translate<00:23:57.360><c> psychogenic</c><00:23:58.000><c> to</c><00:23:58.400><c> um</c><00:23:58.880><c> self-induced</c>

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
translate psychogenic to um self-induced
 

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.230 align:start position:0%
translate psychogenic to um self-induced
then<00:24:00.799><c> it's</c><00:24:01.039><c> like</c><00:24:01.360><c> okay</c><00:24:01.760><c> this</c><00:24:02.000><c> gets</c>

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
then it's like okay this gets
 

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.470 align:start position:0%
then it's like okay this gets
interesting<00:24:02.640><c> and</c><00:24:02.799><c> to</c><00:24:02.960><c> me</c><00:24:03.280><c> it's</c><00:24:03.600><c> psychogenic</c>

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
without the trauma itself so that's

00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's actually a lot of that's
 

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.190 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's actually a lot of that's

and
 

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.190 align:start position:0%
and
so<00:28:13.840><c> i</c><00:28:13.919><c> don't</c><00:28:14.080><c> know</c><00:28:14.240><c> let's</c><00:28:14.480><c> see</c><00:28:14.640><c> if</c><00:28:14.799><c> how</c><00:28:14.960><c> this</c>

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't know let's see if how this
 

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
so i don't know let's see if how this
comes<00:28:15.440><c> across</c><00:28:15.840><c> it's</c><00:28:16.080><c> pretty</c><00:28:16.320><c> weird</c><00:28:17.039><c> um</c><00:28:17.760><c> so</c><00:28:17.919><c> i</c>

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
comes across it's pretty weird um so i
 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.269 align:start position:0%
comes across it's pretty weird um so i
was<00:28:18.159><c> doing</c><00:28:18.480><c> a</c>

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
was doing a
 

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
was doing a
experiment<00:28:19.840><c> kind</c><00:28:20.000><c> of</c><00:28:20.080><c> looking</c><00:28:20.399><c> at</c><00:28:20.559><c> this</c><00:28:20.799><c> a</c>

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
experiment kind of looking at this a
 

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.630 align:start position:0%
experiment kind of looking at this a
model<00:28:21.200><c> of</c><00:28:21.360><c> ptsd</c>

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
model of ptsd
 

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
model of ptsd
and<00:28:23.279><c> i</c><00:28:23.440><c> just</c><00:28:23.760><c> thought</c>

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i just thought
 

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.269 align:start position:0%
and i just thought
i<00:28:25.120><c> thought</c><00:28:25.279><c> oh</c><00:28:25.600><c> i</c><00:28:25.760><c> know</c><00:28:26.240><c> i</c><00:28:26.320><c> have</c><00:28:26.480><c> an</c><00:28:26.640><c> idea</c><00:28:27.039><c> this</c>

00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
i thought oh i know i have an idea this
 

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:30.110 align:start position:0%
i thought oh i know i have an idea this
was<00:28:27.679><c> this</c><00:28:27.919><c> is</c><00:28:28.080><c> totally</c><00:28:28.640><c> an</c><00:28:28.799><c> example</c><00:28:29.200><c> of</c><00:28:29.279><c> like</c>

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
was this is totally an example of like
 

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.990 align:start position:0%
was this is totally an example of like
anthropomorphizing<00:28:31.120><c> stuff</c>

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
anthropomorphizing stuff
 

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.029 align:start position:0%
anthropomorphizing stuff
i<00:28:32.159><c> thought</c><00:28:32.799><c> i</c><00:28:32.880><c> have</c><00:28:33.039><c> an</c><00:28:33.120><c> idea</c><00:28:33.679><c> if</c><00:28:34.240><c> i</c><00:28:34.480><c> give</c><00:28:34.960><c> a</c>

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
i thought i have an idea if i give a
 

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.710 align:start position:0%
i thought i have an idea if i give a
bunch<00:28:35.279><c> of</c><00:28:35.360><c> these</c><00:28:35.520><c> animals</c><00:28:35.760><c> ptsd</c><00:28:36.320><c> and</c><00:28:36.399><c> then</c><00:28:36.559><c> put</c>

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of these animals ptsd and then put
 

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.310 align:start position:0%
bunch of these animals ptsd and then put
them<00:28:36.960><c> back</c><00:28:37.200><c> together</c>

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
them back together
 

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.990 align:start position:0%
them back together
it'll<00:28:38.559><c> help</c><00:28:38.799><c> mitigate</c><00:28:39.200><c> the</c><00:28:39.279><c> effects</c><00:28:39.679><c> kind</c><00:28:39.919><c> of</c>

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
it'll help mitigate the effects kind of
 

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.789 align:start position:0%
it'll help mitigate the effects kind of
like<00:28:40.240><c> when</c><00:28:40.399><c> you</c><00:28:40.480><c> go</c><00:28:40.640><c> to</c><00:28:40.799><c> a</c><00:28:40.880><c> support</c><00:28:41.360><c> group</c><00:28:42.000><c> for</c>

00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
like when you go to a support group for
 

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.710 align:start position:0%
like when you go to a support group for
um<00:28:43.279><c> you</c><00:28:43.360><c> know</c><00:28:43.840><c> where</c><00:28:44.080><c> everyone</c><00:28:44.399><c> else</c><00:28:44.640><c> has</c>

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
um you know where everyone else has
 

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.389 align:start position:0%
um you know where everyone else has

00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
suffered trauma and you talk about it
 

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:48.149 align:start position:0%
suffered trauma and you talk about it
and<00:28:46.559><c> it</c><00:28:46.799><c> seems</c><00:28:47.120><c> to</c><00:28:47.200><c> make</c><00:28:47.440><c> people</c><00:28:47.840><c> seems</c><00:28:48.080><c> to</c>

00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
and it seems to make people seems to
 

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:49.510 align:start position:0%
and it seems to make people seems to
result<00:28:48.399><c> in</c><00:28:48.559><c> better</c><00:28:48.720><c> outcomes</c><00:28:49.039><c> for</c><00:28:49.200><c> people</c><00:28:49.440><c> and</c>

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
result in better outcomes for people and
 

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.789 align:start position:0%
result in better outcomes for people and
things<00:28:49.760><c> like</c><00:28:49.919><c> that</c>

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
things like that
 

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.710 align:start position:0%
things like that
so<00:28:51.200><c> i</c><00:28:51.360><c> took</c><00:28:51.520><c> some</c><00:28:51.760><c> animals</c><00:28:52.240><c> i</c><00:28:52.320><c> gave</c><00:28:52.480><c> them</c><00:28:52.559><c> all</c>

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
so i took some animals i gave them all
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
so i took some animals i gave them all
ptsd<00:28:53.120><c> and</c><00:28:53.200><c> put</c><00:28:53.360><c> them</c><00:28:53.520><c> back</c><00:28:53.679><c> together</c><00:28:54.480><c> and</c><00:28:54.799><c> the</c>

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
ptsd and put them back together and the
 

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%

decided to run another experiment to
 

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
decided to run another experiment to
