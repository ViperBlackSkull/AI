00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
learn in school and then i did the

uh<00:30:11.200><c> they</c><00:30:11.679><c> would</c><00:30:11.919><c> just</c><00:30:12.080><c> feed</c><00:30:12.240><c> them</c><00:30:12.559><c> all</c><00:30:12.799><c> fat</c>

00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%

so<00:30:15.039><c> something</c><00:30:15.360><c> about</c><00:30:15.520><c> an</c><00:30:15.760><c> all</c><00:30:16.000><c> fat</c><00:30:16.320><c> diet</c>

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
so something about an all fat diet
 

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
