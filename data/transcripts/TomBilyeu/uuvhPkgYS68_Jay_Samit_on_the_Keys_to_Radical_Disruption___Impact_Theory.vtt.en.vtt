00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.800
Tom Bilyeu: Everybody, welcome to another
episode of Impact Theory.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.340
You are here, my friends, because you believe
like I do that human potential is nearly limitless,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.359
but you know that having potential is not
the same as actually doing something with

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.359
it.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.050
So our goal with the show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.990
will help you actually execute on your dreams.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.789
Today's guest is a freakishly accomplished
entrepreneur who started his insanely storied

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
career by inventing airport kiosks and music-based
video games.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.340
You know MVD.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.041
And that is just the tip of a very large iceberg.

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:41.190
I assure you, even if I speed read his full
list of accomplishments, it would take me

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.190
an hour.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.190
It's nuts.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.290
So let me just say this: He's built and sold
many of his own companies, held senior management

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.690
positions at Sony, EMI, and Universal Pictures,
taken an equity stake in 80-plus companies,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.329
raised roughly $800 million for start-ups,
helped grow multi-billion-dollar juggernauts

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.770
such as LinkedIn and eBay before they even
IPOed, and helped transform entire industries

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.480
and revamp governments.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.880
Because of his unprecedented track record
of success, everyone from the Pope to the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.490
President have called on him for advice on
how to harness the power of positive change.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.600
His recent book, Disrupt You, grabbed a hold
of my brain and refused to let go.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.730
Not only are the ideas brilliant, but his
words drip with the credibility that only

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.590
comes when you've been a soldier on the front
lines.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.250
And his success on the front lines has made
him one of the most sought after advisors

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580
and speakers on the planet.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.990
He's a contributor to the Wall Street Journal
and host of his documentary series Wall Street

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.500
Journal Startup of the Year.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.970
And he frequently appears on ABC, NBC, Bloomberg,
and many others, as well as teaching innovation

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.940
at the largest engineering school in the country.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.290
He's also helped develop disruptive solutions
for such global brands as Coca-Cola, Disney,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.290
and Microsoft.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.260
So, please, my friends, help me in welcoming
the best selling author and monolithic entrepreneur

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.140
who started his first company because no one
would hire him, the dyslexic master of disruption,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.140
Jay Samit.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.349
Jay Samit: Thanks for having me.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.120
Tom Bilyeu: What a pleasure.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120
Jay Samit: Too kind.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.610
The words were too nice.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.090
Tom Bilyeu: Thank you for saying that.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.090
It's very humble.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.710
But, honestly, your book really freaked me
out, and it stopped me in my tracks.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.770
It ended up changing the whole way that we
do our book reviews now because I was freaking

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.630
out to everybody about your book, that every
entrepreneur needs to read it.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.550
I've listed the 25 books you have to read.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.420
It's going on that list.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.930
So when I did the book review, people were
like, "You didn't capture that same sense

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.930
of enthusiasm."

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.900
So now they're all free wheel and just me
sort of going into the meat because your book

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.950
is transformative.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.319
Truly, I mean that.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.620
We'll get into some of the details, but the
one thing I want to start with, you grew up

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
dyslexic.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.620
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.980
Tom Bilyeu: And when you graduate from college,
it's one of the worst job markets ever.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.290
This is probably my favorite story.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.490
Instead of going and just giving up, you start
your own company, but you do it in a super

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.560
unique way.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.780
Jay Samit: It was the time when Star Wars
had just come out, changed Hollywood.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.920
Special effects, this new great stuff.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.430
What I wanted to do when I got out of college
was I wanted to make special effects in movies

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.580
like that.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.930
A couple of minor problems: I knew no one
in Hollywood, I knew nothing about how to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.580
make special effects, and I was broke.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.349
I realized no one's going to hire somebody
that doesn't have experience.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.580
You're competing against people that do this
for a lifetime or whatever.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.620
So I printed business cards for $1, and I
made up a fake company, Jasamit Productions,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.760
Jay Allen Samit, and it's mine.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.360
But I didn't make myself head of the company.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.500
I just myself a lowly job.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.030
Tom Bilyeu: See, that's the part that freaks
me out.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.500
How'd you get that insight?

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.040
That's so smart.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.440
Jay Samit: The other thing that I had done
at the same time is I knew where I wanted

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.570
to work, but I didn't know how you got a foot
in the door.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.940
So I ran an ad, back when there used to be
newspapers, you ran a physical ad, describing

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.020
the job that I wanted.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.400
It was a blind ad, it didn't say what the
company was.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.150
Then I got a bunch of resumes in, and that
told me a bunch of data.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.670
One, it told me what type of resume could
get that job, so what would I have to do.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.410
Two, it told me people that worked somewhere
that had one foot out the door, so I now knew

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.449
a list of companies that would have openings.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.800
Then I regurgitated how to frame what I could
do in that language and apply it to these

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.069
people who didn't have jobs yet, and that's
how you get a job.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.889
Tom Bilyeu: Let me put you in my shoes now
for a second.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.680
I pick your book up, I have no idea where
it's going to go.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680
Good reviews.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.159
Thought "Okay, let me give this a shot."

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.099
I start reading, and we get on to that story
about how not only did you not just give up,

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.569
that you make a business card.

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.110
Not only that, but you were smart enough to
make yourself a low level employee.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.389
Not only did you do that, but you had run
an ad to identify people that were leaving

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.389
their job.

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.460
It's just like ... There are few people that
make me go, "I'm just not smart enough to

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.610
be this person."

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.680
It's so insightful
Jay Samit: It's not smart.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.960
Here's the thing.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.800
Everybody and probably what draws people to
your show and why your show's so valuable,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.900
is people have problems in their lives.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.650
Most people sit there and dwell on the problems
or they relive yesterday.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.110
Every day you spend living yesterday's problem,
you're giving up your future.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.500
It makes no sense.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.059
But if you say "I have problems.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.639
Am I unique?

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.969
Am I the only one that has these problems?"

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.639
And the answer probably is "No."

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.099
So find a problem that a lot of people have,
solve it, and that's all that being an entrepreneur

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.689
is, that's all that a business person is.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.889
The more problems that you have in your life,
the more successful you'll be.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.090
Tom Bilyeu: I love that.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.380
Jay Samit: I had problems.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.620
I had two sons very early, and I'm like, "They
got to eat.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.990
I got to eat.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.219
I got to provide for my family."

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.779
How do you solve the things?

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.189
What piece of information do I need?

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.289
Let's do the modern version of the whole thing.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.909
There's no more newspapers, what do you do?

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.159
I tell the story that a young man wisely did.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.560
It's a guy who got his job out of college
at the bottom of one of these multinational

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.860
ad agencies.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.930
Layers and layers of stuff.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.889
He's doing mindless stuff.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.099
He hates every day in his cubicle.

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.819
He wanted to do creative stuff.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.650
So he realizes there's some big famous creative
directors at the tops of these agencies.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.350
He's Googling one day, and he realizes nobody
bought their names as keywords.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.449
So he just put "I want to work for you" with
a link to his portfolio and bought the keywords

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.409
of these five most famous guys in the industry.

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:32.699
Three out of five called him.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.529
Tom Bilyeu: Because of Googling themselves,
right?

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:35.529
Jay Samit: Right.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:36.550
Everybody Googles themselves.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.699
Got job offers and accelerated about 20 years
of his career.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:43.889
It's that easy.

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.639
By the way, his investment was more than mine.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.710
He spent about $9.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.680
Tom Bilyeu: Wow, so he really went broke doing
it.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680
Tom Bilyeu: Right, yeah.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
Big investment.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.680
Jay Samit: So I've been very lucky.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.520
You wake up, you're a kid of normal means,
and dozens of your friends become billionaires.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.309
We weren't brighter, we didn't go to the right
schools, we didn't do anything.

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.139
What happened?

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.139
The world changed.

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.229
Well, the world's continuing to change.

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.699
We have self-made billionaires in their 20s
happening almost monthly.

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.789
They have the same 24 hours in the day that
you and I do.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:16.409
What are they doing differently?

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:21.330
What are they doing that can be learned from
and copied and emulated to solve a different

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.400
problem?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.569
And if you're not motivated by money, how
to use these same tools to change the world?

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:29.020
Because the world's got problems.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.479
Tom Bilyeu: Yeah, no question.

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.139
You've said that it takes nothing more than
insight and drive to be successful.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:39.809
Then the question that like screamed out of
my mind was can you train to be more insightful?

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:40.809
Jay Samit: Absolutely.

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:41.809
Tom Bilyeu: All right.

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:42.809
How do you do that?

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:45.360
Jay Samit: Here's a simple exercise for everybody
watching.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.020
I guarantee you that 30 days from today, from
when you watch this, you will have more deal

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.330
flow than any venture capital firm in Silicon
Valley.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.789
Take a piece of paper, and today, write three
problems in your life.

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:01.110
I hit traffic this morning.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.169
I forgot to take my medicine.

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:04.710
Whatever it might be.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.589
But do this every day for a month.

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:09.119
Because what you're going to find is first
day, it's kind of easy.

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:10.479
Maybe the second day.

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.750
But after that, you're like, "Okay, I wrote
down my problems."

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.779
So what else is a problem that you aren't
identifying because you've accepted that's

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:18.830
the way it is.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.409
That's the way it's always been.

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:22.199
You work at a big corporation.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.499
"Well, this is the way we do it."

00:08:23.499 --> 00:08:26.849
Well, you're going to go out of business doing
that.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:32.610
Then, when you have those 90 ideas, what are
you passionate about and what affects the

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.669
most people?

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.089
The intersection of those two.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:42.820
In your life, you were passionate about nutrition,
that it could change people's lives.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:50.250
And you saw a way that you could financially
impact them with a healthy bar.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.680
Those intersections led to success.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.160
Your insight got you there, and you solved
for a whole bunch of people.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:07.529
No one sells a product, no one buys something,
no one went into a store and bought a 1/4"

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.490
drill bit because they wanted a 1/4" drill
bit.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.579
They wanted a 1/4" hole.

00:09:11.579 --> 00:09:12.579
Right?

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:13.579
Tom Bilyeu: Very well said.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:14.579
Yeah.

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:16.500
Jay Samit: Somebody made the drill bit because
you wanted a hole.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.670
So fill those holes.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.790
That's as simple as it can be.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.470
Tom Bilyeu: Do you still do that today?

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.080
Do you keep a list of problems that you encounter?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.650
Jay Samit: All the time.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.240
I'll give you examples of ones that I'm working
on right now for clients.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.880
I'm obsessed with augmented reality and virtual
reality, and it solves problems that couldn't

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.440
be solved before.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.330
It can connect people in the field to experts
somewhere else where they can see what I'm

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.529
seeing and all that.

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:48.589
Working with an overnight package delivery
company that just adding augmented reality

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:52.780
glasses can save them 30% of their jet fuel.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.370
Tom Bilyeu: How?

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.790
Jay Samit: There's a whole bunch of people
who have the job.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.269
You ever sit on a plane and see the metal
container that they slide in that curved thing?

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:01.269
Tom Bilyeu: Yeah.

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:02.269
Yeah.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.300
Jay Samit: There's people whose jobs are to
throw packages into that container.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.759
It's a high turnover job.

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:06.720
It's not a fun job.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.889
If you're not good at it, about 1/3 of that
container is going to be air.

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:12.209
If you'd been doing it a bunch of years, you
can pack it tighter.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:16.210
If 1/3 of each container is air, that means
one out of three planes is flying empty.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.300
That's a ton of jet fuel.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.170
That's billions of dollars a year.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.460
What if you can turn it into 3D Tetris?

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.620
What if it's a fun game and you can bonus
people based on performance and doing well

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.740
and doing it.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.460
Now, you save the environment, you make the
company more profitable, and make the job

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.670
more fun, and you allow those that take pride
in their work to take home more money.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.399
Tom Bilyeu: It's a fascinating approach.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.580
I love that.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.050
But coming back out for a second-
Jay Samit: Sure.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.080
Tom Bilyeu: This comes down to the game that
my partner and I were playing that ended up

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.750
leading to Quest, the same game that I played
that ended up in Impact Theory is "No bullshit,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.050
what would it take?"

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.339
So no bullshit, what does it take to ... In
the case of Quest, it was no bullshit, what

00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:57.660
would it take to help my family be happy?

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.260
I wanted to see them happy, and I just knew
that the body was part of that equation.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.570
At Impact Theory, the question was no bullshit,
what would it take to end, what I called,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.990
generational poverty, which is about mindset.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.180
It's not about money.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.810
And the answer was very clear.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.090
I want to leverage behavior, I don't want
to change it.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.079
So the behavior that we need to leverage is,
and this is my stance, if narrative is the

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:22.810
way that people assimilate truly disruptive
information, then we know that we're going

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.100
to be dealing with narrative.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.029
I think you've got books, comic books, movies,
television, video games, that sort of the

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:30.910
arena that you're playing in.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.970
So how do we leverage that to actually inform
the next generation of entrepreneurs?

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.360
That, because I think commerce at the end
of the day is the way that you're going to

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.579
bring in to the real world the change that
you're having people assimilate?

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.949
That is that loop.

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:49.259
That was us playing that game, and it sounds
very similar.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:52.980
If you've got these, all the problems that
you have every day, and let's take one that

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.570
you've talked about before, and the problem
is traffic.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.540
I don't want to sit in traffic anymore.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.970
You play the "No bullshit, what would it take?"

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.180
Okay, I need to know where cars are actually
going.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.709
I need to be able to dictate where they go
so that you can basically distribute the traffic,

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:08.490
which ended up being ways essentially-
Jay Samit: Right.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.720
But the insight that they had was, right,
I'm sitting in traffic.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.779
The phone company knows that my phone's here
and your phone's there.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:20.670
If they can tell your phone to go left and
mine to go right, there's no traffic.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.670
That was the insight.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.100
And a lot of people go, "Well, you're talking
about tech stuff.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.420
I'm not an engineer."

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.870
How many lines of code did Steve Jobs write
in his career building the world's biggest

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.870
tech company?

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.870
Tom Bilyeu: Zero.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.870
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.870
So we all live with technology.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.139
But you bring up a bigger point.

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:41.230
What's driving me right now?

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.439
Our world is changing at a pace that most
people can't grasp.

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:48.569
Government's definitely can't grasp it right
now.

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:55.029
That is if we go back 100 years ago, half
the people worked on farms, and half the people

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:56.029
worked in cities.

00:12:56.029 --> 00:12:59.310
And two pieces of technology: irrigation and
the tractor.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:04.950
Today, we have 2% of the people making food
for all of the US and exporting.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.149
That means half the people lost their jobs
on farms, but they were absorbed by the Industrial

00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:10.199
Revolution.

00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:15.180
So we live during a century where we saw a
half of the jobs disappear.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.839
Now we're living in a time where over the
next 10 years, half of all jobs will disappear.

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:21.980
Robotics replacing unskilled labor.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.600
You raise minimum wage to assemble a burger,
a robot will assemble a burger, a robot will

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600
make a pizza.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.089
An app will take your order.

00:13:31.089 --> 00:13:35.910
White collar jobs, half of middle management
jobs over the next five years are going to

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.910
disappear.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.529
Number one job on tax returns is truck driver.

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:42.680
Eight percent of the population drives a vehicle.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.290
Autonomous vehicles, those are gone.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.290
Autonomous boats.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.290
Everything.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.100
3D printing, et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.689
So even your professionals, AI systems and
machine learning get rid of a lot of lawyers,

00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:56.910
a lot of doctors, a lot of accounting.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.970
What do you do with all those people?

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.600
What makes life enjoyable is a stable middle
class.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.470
So no bullshit, how do you solve that?

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.470
How do you build a big middle class?

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.839
The same technology that is automating away
those things that were mundane and don't need

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:17.360
to be repeated connects us to billions of
other people.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.290
So you can now solve problems that scale much
quicker.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:28.139
From 2008 in the recession, all of the job
gains globally have come from entrepreneurs.

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:30.389
They haven't come from big business.

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:33.560
So how do you teach people to start companies?

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.459
How do you get people to replicate your journey?

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.790
It can be in almost any field.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.560
If you have a life with no problems, yeah,
there's nothing to do.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.130
Tom Bilyeu: Let me ask you a question that's
going to draw a line for people.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.560
Do you plan to monetize that or is this purely
philanthropic for you?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.889
Jay Samit: The goal isn't for me to monetize.

00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:57.850
I've been very lucky, and life's good, and
the kids are good.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.740
I didn't write the book to make money.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:07.290
I did it to scale ... I was teaching how to
build a high tech startup.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.290
I taught.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.120
The most successful was two students did $150
million in top line their first year.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.170
Tom Bilyeu: Good lord.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.170
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.209
Makes you really feel like a failure.

00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:16.209
Brilliant idea.

00:15:16.209 --> 00:15:18.720
One of the best pitches I've ever heard.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.040
I judge hackathons around the world, and I'm
turning the hackathon experience into a TV

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.410
show to teach people how to do this because
let's go from the selfish standpoint.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:35.610
If all an entrepreneur does is solve problems,
who are they solving them for?

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.839
Everybody else.

00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:40.180
I have problems, I would like a better world.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.000
So the more people that are solving problems,
the better life is for everybody.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.050
We were taught that there was like only so
many slices of pie, and it's mine or yours,

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.560
a zero sum game.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.439
That isn't how the world really works.

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:57.189
That isn't how capital is created.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:01.430
You create a new company, and somebody buys
stock for $10, and somebody else buys stock

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.060
for 20, you've now created a whole bunch of
money that didn't exist in the system.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.019
People don't realize money isn't all printed
by a government.

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:11.149
Entrepreneurs actually create money.

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:18.639
Bitcoin created a new currency that may end
up being more trustworthy than any nation-state

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.009
currency.

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:26.449
It's an amazing time to be on the planet,
so if I can help people achieve that success

00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:29.250
... Take it on the simplest.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.389
We'd love going to a movie that cost $200
million to make, back to the Star Wars thing.

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:37.459
I love living in a world where somebody's
willing to spend $200 million to entertain

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.410
my ass for two hours.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.699
It doesn't get better than that.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:44.959
Tom Bilyeu: The reason I ask you about the
path to monetization is I think one of the

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:48.199
things ... It's the middle ground that people
get lost in.

00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:53.070
You can show people that, hey, I used to be,
what I say, I used to have a slave mentality.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.459
I kept my head down, did as little work as
possible, and avoided punishment at all costs.

00:16:56.459 --> 00:16:59.139
Then I can show you that I was very, very
successful.

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:01.819
But people don't get to see that in-between.

00:17:01.819 --> 00:17:06.309
And what I think you're doing just amazingly
well, and what people will get in the book,

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:09.110
are literally the things that you have to
do to your mind, the ways you have to think,

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.760
the sort of baseline belief systems you have
to bring on to your own life that are going

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.790
to allow you go take this grand idea ... If
I want to build a massive middle class, maybe

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.330
you're not thinking of that particular problem
this way, but you can take whatever your grand

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:29.350
problem is, and then how do I create an ecosystem
around it that's financially self-sustaining?

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:34.910
And allowing people the things that they need
to do to their mind to create a real business.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.810
Jay Samit: When you read Disrupt You, I'm
putting you on the spot, was there anything

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.890
that I said or laid out in those chapters
that after the light bulb went out and you

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.340
go, "Wow, I never saw I that way" that you
didn't instantly absorb and say "Oh, yeah,

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.610
this makes sense"?

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.570
Tom Bilyeu: I kind of know what you're asking.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:57.400
Yes, there were things that were watershed
moments for me, which is why I think the book

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400
is so important.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.310
But they were in hindsight, self evident.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.940
Jay Samit: That's the point.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.830
None of this stuff is not common sense.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:11.220
It's just we were pushed down a path of blinders
our whole lives.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.810
For well-intentioned reasons in many cases.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.520
But the educational system was designed to
have you work at a factory.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.590
The IQ test was invented to let the Army know
which people were cannon fodder, and you could

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.710
just let them get killed, and which people
had potential.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.680
When in fact, we all have potential.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.520
What we have to do is figure out where to
channel it and what are those steps.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.290
There's no gatekeepers to capital anymore.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:44.900
There's no exclusive country club or college
or this or that.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.260
And we're all interconnected, so it doesn't
matter whether you're in a big city or in

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.250
Botswana, you can still reach six billion
consumers.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.080
So what's stopping you?

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.430
That fear of failure.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.720
That "Oh, if I fail what will people say?"

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.210
Failing's a great thing.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.520
Failing teaches you what doesn't work.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.030
Failure is throwing in the towel.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:15.620
You take that job to be secure, you go for
that big Fortune 500 company, and most of

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.040
the Fortune 500 companies go out of business.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.420
There's less than 10% of them left.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.420
That's amazing statement.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.420
Of the original list.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.420
Tom Bilyeu: Yeah.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.420
No kidding.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.830
Jay Samit: So it's not the security that's
robbing ambition, it's the illusion of security

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.500
that robs ambition.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.130
So the biggest risk you can take in life is
not taking one.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.180
If you're at that point where you're in the
middle of your career, and you lost your job,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:41.300
or you're just out of college and starting,
or just out of high school, go talk to a senior

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.920
citizen about what they really regret about
their lives.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.240
It's not what they failed at.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.890
It's what they didn't try.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.550
It's the regrets of "Why didn't I?"

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:56.990
If you try something and you fail, you learn
a skill set for something else.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:03.750
Steve Jobs, a great entrepreneur, college
wasn't for him, he bounced around, but he

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.340
audited and took a class in calligraphy.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.340
It's useless.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.830
What's the point of that?

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:13.200
But when it came the time of the birth of
the PC, and IBM had all the rational ways

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.470
to make a good machine, he remembered that
calligraphy course and said, "We're going

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.190
to have fonts on our machine."

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.130
One divergent of "We got a few fonts here,
and these guys only have one," graphic artists

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.850
are using this machine.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:33.870
Adobe, the whole future music, the iPod, the
iPhone, all come from one calligraphy class.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.110
Tom Bilyeu: What's one of the most important
things you hope people take away from the

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.110
book?

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:46.210
Jay Samit: That all of the big famous people
that you hear about, Richard Branson and Steve

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:52.970
Jobs and Zuckerberg and everyone, they're
no different than you are.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:58.150
Seventy-something percent of the world's billionaires
are self-made.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.780
You can achieve this.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.210
It's not going to be easy.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.050
You don't just wake up on Tuesday and become
rich on Wednesday.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:12.170
But it doesn't take any more effort than going
to a job that you hate.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.810
And unless you believe in reincarnation, you
got one shot on this planet.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.560
One shot.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.870
So don't you want to make a difference?

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:27.640
Don't you want to leave something behind and
make the planet better than you found it?

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.860
Why are you here?

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.860
What do you want to accomplish with your life?

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.610
It doesn't have to be [inaudible 00:21:31],
and it doesn't have to be money-oriented.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.671
The same principles that disrupt you, you
can change the educational system, you can

00:21:38.671 --> 00:21:39.671
change healthcare.

00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:45.690
I am humbled by what I'm seeing people create
around the world with so little.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.820
But we are on this ball together.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.920
We can solve problems together.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.800
We can make a better future together.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:01.450
It's an optimistic story that you get to write
your piece of the story.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.710
Why wouldn't people want to push their potential?

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:06.710
Aim for the stars.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.800
If you don't make it all the way, you made
it to the moon.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.890
Not bad.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:15.620
Tom Bilyeu: That notion of solving these problems
together, I think is exactly what I took away

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.620
from the book.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.880
Or at least problem solving in general, and
that's one of the things I think people, when

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.610
they read the book, they're going to find
example after example that will light them

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.610
on fire.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.610
I'll give you a few of my favorites.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:29.020
I'd love some more color or how people can
get better at this.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.050
When you first start, you think "Oh, man.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.050
No brainer.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.250
I've got this device that's for the lottery."

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.250
Right?

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.250
Jay Samit: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.250
Tom Bilyeu: So you've got the old school lottery
thing.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.540
It's those ugly, sort of green, one color
dot matrix-y looking thing.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.100
Then you had this display panel, this beautiful
... It could talk if I'm not mistaken.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.100
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.330
Got to go back before we all had PCs, before
computers were everywhere.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.120
I'm that old, yes.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.420
Lotteries were coming out to different states,
and they had a little thing with the little

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.270
just green numbers that you type in, and then
it prints your ticket.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.770
There was a contract for California.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.240
We had a six-foot-tall machine, big color
screen, a motion detector.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.570
Again, this is 1980s.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.380
You walk by in the supermarkets, "Psst.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.610
What would you do with $1 million?"

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.560
And you're looking around because nobody every
talked to you before.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.960
This machine could should you the cars and
the yachts and all this stuff.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960
And you could touch.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.730
Oh, and by the way, it said "Touch me" in
six different languages, if I remember correctly.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.910
So if you only spoke Vietnamese, boom, now
the machine does it.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.890
You could make your own things.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.770
And I'm now going to go for the biggest contract
in my life.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.700
I'm in my early 20s.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.020
Every penny I have is into this.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.370
I'm up against a company that has this little
green thing.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.340
I'm as cocky as can be.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.340
This is it.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:55.510
I go to this meeting, I win the contract,
I'll be a millionaire, life is good, dah dah

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.510
dah.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.950
Two fun things that maybe I didn't elaborate
in the book.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.500
Didn't get the contract.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:08.650
Turns out the FBI had a secret camera videoing
in a hotel room where somebody, a state Senator

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.680
named Alan Robbins, took a suitcase of $50,000
to vote for the other guys.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.130
Even though the FBI sent him to prison, and
that's all true and fact, they didn't invalidate

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.540
the awarding of the contract to my competition.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.540
Tom Bilyeu: That's crazy.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:26.140
Jay Samit: Now I'm flying back to LA.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.600
I didn't know how to raise money for my first
company, so I had like 10 credit cards all

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.600
maxed out.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.560
I can't pay them.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.060
I don't know what I'm going to do.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.700
I don't even have enough money to take a cab
home from LAX.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.340
I'm trying to figure out the bus system in
Los Angeles.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.250
Public transportation, not our strong suit.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:51.140
They used to have, back in the '80s, these
nice counters manned by volunteer little old

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.360
ladies that would tell you how to get a bus
or a cab or a van or a hotel or anything.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.300
Of course, by the time I got back, there's
nobody there.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.000
I go, "Wait a second.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.130
If she was there, she could only speak English.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.730
She would only know a certain amount of information.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.810
There's visitors from tons of languages.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.901
Why don't you put a kiosk here?

00:25:10.901 --> 00:25:13.860
Why don't you let people get all the information
and have live data?"

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.980
This is before the internet and before smartphones,
before any of that.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.980
Today, when you go through an airport, everything
you do is with a kiosk.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.170
My back was against the wall.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:31.131
I didn't set out to do a kiosk there, and
most of my early successes were somebody else

00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:35.630
developed a piece of technology that didn't
hit its mark, and I'm going, "Oh, wow.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.490
They got $100 million into making those laser
discs, and nobody's buying them for their

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.490
home.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:42.490
They're interactive.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.490
That'd be good for corporate training.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.490
Let me go sell that to Ford.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.010
Let me go sell that to this one and that one."

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:52.870
So I started realizing that it wasn't the
inventors of technology, it was the people

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.120
that brought them to market.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.940
I have the skill set to do that.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.980
I just have to figure out what something and
move it somewhere else.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:07.640
That was the genesis of a whole life where
I suddenly look back one day and go, "Wow,

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.320
I came how far?

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320
Doing what?"

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320
Tom Bilyeu: Yeah.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320
I had this sense.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.770
I'm reading the book, and I have this sense
that I started to envision myself walking

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.600
through the world pushing piles of cash out
the way to like get to whatever stupid thing

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.010
it was that I was trying to do.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.970
Because every story you would tell would start
with, like that one, where it was abject failure.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:33.080
You're in the airport and now no longer have
enough money to get home, but from that comes

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.740
your first massive success.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.740
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.390
Tom Bilyeu: Then there was another story where
you're doing music, you've got this whole

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.540
great idea for launching this new digital
service, nobody's going for it, and you come

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.290
up with the idea of the concert in the sky.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.650
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.260
Didn't come up with the idea for concert in
the sky.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.620
Back to failure.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.640
Richard Branson who's launched eight billion-dollar
companies.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.490
He's launched about 300 companies.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:04.860
The most genius thing that Richard ever did
in hindsight was his brand is Virgin, which

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.170
means you're a newbie, you don't know what
you're doing.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.610
So every company of his that fails only strengthens
the brand.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.670
He's not afraid to try.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:14.670
Virgin Cola.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.490
Oh, the other guys have every piece of distribution
on Earth?

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.300
End of Virgin Cola.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.830
Anyway, he had had this idea of doing for
Virgin Airlines, a concert in the sky, but

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.140
it's against FAA rules to play an instrument
on an airplane.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.140
Tom Bilyeu: Really?

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.140
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.410
There used to be an airline called MGM that,
in the upstairs of the 747, had a piano bar,

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.050
and the other people couldn't compete, so
they banned so that they can't play an instrument.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.920
Because they could interfere with the electronics
and everything else.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.520
Anyway, I have to launch something up against
iTunes.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.960
I don't have the same budget.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.140
They're spending $100 million a year advertising.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.030
So I go, "Okay, who's got problems?

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.320
Let me look and see who's got problems."

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.070
There were two companies that had bad years.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:06.700
United, one of the biggest carriers, was in
bankruptcy and was trying to come out of bankruptcy.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.900
And Spurlock had just done Super Size Me,
and McDonald's sales were down.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.900
Great.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.480
Now I've got my partners.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.460
Now I just have to figure out how to make
what I want to do their priority and spend

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.420
their money to launch my store.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.420
That's the way I think.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.420
Tom Bilyeu: That's brilliant.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.600
You've said that there's no such thing as
not having money or running out of money or

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600
something like that.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600
Jay Samit: Right.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600
OPM, other people's money.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.710
There's somebody else who wants to reach the
same audience that you do.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.860
Most likely, they don't have a new, fresh
idea.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.090
If you bring a fresh idea, they already have
it budgeted.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:42.260
So for McDonald's we did a buy a Big Mac,
get a free track.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.980
A secret code on every Big Mac package, and
you get a free download from my store.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.280
But you have to register at my new store to
get it, so 20 million customers registered

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280
the first week.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.210
Because nobody does marketing, TV commercials,
in-store signage, and I held out on the contract

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:01.080
for the tray liner, so when the kids are playing
in the Happy Meal Land, mom and dad are reading

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.110
every line of "Ooh, I can get free music."

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.380
Amazing marketing partner.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.600
Amazing company.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.390
By the way, because I know you're into health
and nutrition, if America wanted to eat tofu,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.560
McDonald's would be the number one seller
of tofu.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.590
They know marketing.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.190
Then I went to United and said, "Wow.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.170
You have all these people who used to fly
with you that have enough miles, it turned

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.820
out, to go back and forth to Pluto nine times.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.370
Let's let them use their frequent flyer miles
to get music in the store.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.210
And to announce this, we'll do this concert."

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.690
So I took out of my back pocket somebody else's
idea that they didn't execute.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.830
Sheryl Crow, 30,000 feet.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.640
Then we filled the plane with nothing but
journalists.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:50.680
Shot a nine-camera shoot, edited it on Vaio
laptops in first class, so when they got off

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.230
the plane, they had an edited piece that could
lead the evening news.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.930
They painted the outside of the plane.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.570
This whole thing costs nothing.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.600
Not a penny.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.580
Tom Bilyeu: Didn't it actually earn you like
$3 million before it even started?

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.580
Jay Samit: Yes.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:10.310
One of the punchlines of it was McDonald's
had done this great promotion for the Olympics

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:16.340
that was in Los Angeles that every time the
US got a gold medal, you got a free french

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.900
fries or free burger or something.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:23.830
And Russia pulled out, so we won all the medals,
and McDonald's lost millions and millions

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.830
of dollars with the promotion.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.330
So they took out insurance on all their other
promotions in case freak things happen.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:34.150
What if everybody redeemed, and the price
of this music was outrageous.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.560
After I got this signed off to do this whole
thing, McDonald's says, "Okay, we have to

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.580
get insurance for this."

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.240
I go, "Oh, yeah."

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.030
Everything's printed, done, I've told everybody,
it's about to launch.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.530
"The insurance in six million dollars, so
you got to pitch in three."

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.330
I don't have three million.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:55.660
I can't go to my boss and, "Oops, I made a
$3 million mistake."

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.010
That's called career ending.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.440
So I'm like, "I'm screwed.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.560
This is over."

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.970
I'm like, "I got into something I don't understand.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.390
I didn't know."

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.740
Then I went through how do you solve a problem?

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.120
The problem wasn't three million, the problem
was insurance.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.360
I said, "Wait a second.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.990
What if we insured McDonald's?"

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.270
And they said, "Yeah."

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:20.350
So we insured McDonald's, so they wrote me
a check for three million.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:26.470
Then I went to the board and said, "Yeah,
we just launched this thing, and we haven't

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.280
sold a single song yet, but we're $3 million
in profits."

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.250
Tom Bilyeu: That's amazing.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.800
I wanted to punch myself in the mouth when
I read that story.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.960
No, no, no, for real.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.740
This is one of those things that I really
want to know.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.050
I want there to be a process that I can use.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:46.730
Like here are the three things you have to
ask yourself at any moment of failure or something.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.080
That would be so useful.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.290
Because reading that, and this, I think, is
your superpower.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.990
It's unbelievable the way that ... Yes.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.710
It is how it felt to read it.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.640
In the book, he's telling the story like it's
happening in real time.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.020
I'm going to be the hero in the company, and
then, oh shit, the night before, "No, sorry,

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.960
you own $3 million."

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.810
That's where most people tap out, and they
have a story where they tell their friends

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:12.810
they did this whole thing.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.540
"I lost my job because what am I going to
do?

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.570
It's $3 million."

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:20.220
Jay Samit: I hate ... The modern version of
the dog ate my homework is when an entrepreneur

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.660
says, "The company was really going really
well, but we couldn't raise any more money."

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.810
No, that's like you failed at raising money.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.100
You don't know how to raise money.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.660
You didn't go to people that could raise you
money.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.800
You didn't tap everything.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.230
You didn't try crowdfunding.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.860
Don't say "Oh, well.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.110
We ran out of money."

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:43.751
Tom Bilyeu: Do you immediately go to "I need
money, but I don't yet know where I'm going

00:32:43.751 --> 00:32:46.950
to get it, but I know that I have a problem,
somebody else shares the problem, and the

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.950
solution would help us both.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:48.950
I'll get them to pay for it."

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.950
Is it that sort of simple?

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:57.680
Jay Samit: The other example was when I wanted
to sell training to Ford Motor.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.410
I'm 20-something years old.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.620
To shorten the story, I had a solution would
save them a couple hundred million dollars.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.160
I know nothing about cars.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.770
I know nothing about Detroit, Ford, the old
auto industry.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:13.240
I'm in California, and I'm in my 20s, and
it's a very conservative, old fashioned, big

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.610
manufacturing, dah dah dah.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:19.160
I'm trying to solve for how to connect the
dots.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.540
So put yourself in the other person's perspective.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:27.740
I'm trying to think who does that executive
that I want to figure out who to meet, what's

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.740
their day like?

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.740
What motivates them?

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.690
What would get them excited?

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.410
What would they spend time on?

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.411
So I'm thinking this is Middle America, this
is corporate America, this is Americana, this

00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:45.370
is America, the old hot dog, Chevrolet, and
football type thing.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.720
This is Ford football.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.190
Well, I looked.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:54.850
There was a football coach from Michigan State,
famous coach, award-winning coach, who just

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.850
retired.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.730
Easy to find him, call him up.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.670
"You're my new head of sales."

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.030
He knows nothing about technology.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.080
All we had to do was go and get the meeting.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.930
They'd talk about the football game of such
and such, when the guy did the thing with

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.990
the thing and dah dah dah.

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.040
"What's the kid here for?

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040
Okay, here.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
He's got some business."

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040
I kid you not.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040
It's that easy.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.230
LinkedIn was Reid's way of turning that into
data.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:22.070
Tom Bilyeu: [crosstalk 00:34:18]
Jay Samit: You know somebody that knows somebody.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.340
We're all connected.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.060
Tom Bilyeu: Why do you say he's a smartest
person you've ever met?

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.750
Jay Samit: He's absolutely the smartest person.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:37.210
If you look at this original business plan
for LinkedIn, there's 10 key pieces of data.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.500
Number of users for the first five years and
revenue for the first five years.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.840
If you overlay the actual, it looks like a
glove.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:50.070
He sees things in a way that's farther ahead
than everybody else.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.450
Reid Hoffman was one of the first people to
mention to me this Airbnb idea.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:55.450
Really?

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:57.290
I'm going to let people stay at my house?

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:58.290
I don't think so.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.290
I'm going to stay at their house?

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:00.290
I don't think so.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.830
Oh, I should've paused and said, "A, Reid's
smarter than me.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.990
And B, it's not about me.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:10.180
I'm not the demographic for every case."

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:17.820
Reid has invested and started so many successful
things since PayPal, and LinkedIn, and Kiva,

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:23.610
and Zynga, and the first money into Facebook
and connecting the first investors.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.160
Just one of those type of people.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.870
Everyone should spend their time trying to
be around people that you feel are smarter

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.870
than you.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.970
That doesn't necessarily mean more educated.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:41.360
I'm no longer in the young whippersnapper
generation, so I have to spend a lot of time

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.210
with millennials to understand the world from
their point of view because they have a huge

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.210
advantage over me.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.790
Tom Bilyeu: Do you do that because you have
younger kids?

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.790
Jay Samit: No.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.320
Tom Bilyeu: Or is there a way to systemitize
that?

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.580
Jay Samit: That's one of the reasons that
I teach at universities, and volunteer at

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.800
hackathons, and try to work.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.140
Because we calcify as humans.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.770
What we do is we develop habits to free our
mind to do other things, so we don't have

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:07.950
to think about everything.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.580
A great example is when one of my sons was
looking for an apartment.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.030
We were driving around.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.000
"Ooh, write down that phone number.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
We'll call.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
That's a good building."

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.910
He takes his phone and goes like this.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.390
Wouldn't have occurred to me.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.900
Yes, I have a phone.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.330
Yes, I know it takes pictures.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.570
Yes, I take pictures.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.520
But I have a habit that says "Grab a piece
of paper."

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:34.360
If you can break past the habits, you'll find
that there are problems that young people

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.500
are looking for that app because they assume
somebody must've already solved this.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.500
When they don't find it, they then stop as
opposed to you may have been the first person

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.330
to think about solving traffic with an app.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:53.490
And when you have a new field, AI, 3D printing,
augmented reality.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.940
It's virgin turf.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.090
You don't have to be the best.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:02.870
Here's the takeaway: Be the best at what you
do or the only one doing it.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:07.120
Because if you're the only one doing it, you're
the best.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.360
That's a lot better than competing.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.590
Tom Bilyeu: What are some classic mistakes
that you think entrepreneurs make?

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:17.680
Jay Samit: Not delegating is the first one.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680
Tom Bilyeu: Really?

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.030
Jay Samit: The biggest problem people have
is the second person you hire is not going

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.800
to be as good as you are at whatever it was.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:31.360
So what I try to explain to first time entrepreneurs
is you're an A student at whatever that is,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.990
you're going to have to hire C students.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:37.920
An A student gets a 90 on a test, a C student
gets a 60, but two of them get 120.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.150
Tom Bilyeu: That's a great point.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.360
Jay Samit: So three of them are outdoing you
guaranteed, and you have to then figure out

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.370
the systems.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:51.860
The second one is, and I was guilty of this
for at least a decade if not longer.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:57.460
I would leave meetings so frustrated when,
to the older generation, "Why don't they get

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.460
it?

00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.460
I am right.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.560
I am so right.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.560
What don't they see?"

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.940
I had this meeting at a major corporation
with the CEO that I got into, and I'm walking

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:11.000
down the long hallway in ARMA New York past
IBM's Electrics and IBM's Electrics, typewriters

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.980
on all the desks, realizing nobody in the
C suite was on PCs.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.180
I'm going like, "Ooh, this meeting's not going
to go well.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.660
Because I'm living in a digital age, and they're
in hieroglyphics."

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.210
What I realized was their job isn't to get
it.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.030
They're successful.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.530
Their future may be in doubt, but they're
successful.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:38.050
You have to learn how to explain the future
in a way that people living in the past can

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.050
embrace.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.330
That's where change happens.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.190
Going in there, "You're wrong.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.190
You're stupid.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.190
You don't get it."

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.860
Tom Bilyeu: I came across that part in the
book.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.670
I stopped and wrote it down verbatim.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.390
I'll paraphrase it here.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.610
Their job isn't to get it.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.261
Your job is to become so good at communication
that you can convince them of it.

00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:57.700
It was something like that.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.700
And I was like, "Oh, man.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.200
Those are words to live by."

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.650
Because it's so easy, like you were saying
when people, the classic excuses, "Oh, I ran

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.740
out of money," "Business was right there,
but I ran out of money."

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:12.360
The same thing is, I've seen it countless
times in larger companies where people are

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.480
like, "I have this brilliant idea, but they
don't get it."

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.500
Like you were saying.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.590
When you take the ownership yourself, and
you put yourself in the driver's seat, I think

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.420
you get a step closer to what I think really
has made you so great and so successful, and

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.300
this is certainly what turned me on so much
about your book, which is basically Ryan Holiday's

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.310
concept of the obstacle is the way.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:37.550
Jay Samit: It's really amazing when you come
up with a big, hairy, audacious idea, a goal,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.550
something.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:42.300
You want to get me motivated, there's only
one thing you have to say to me: "You can't."

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.300
That's it.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.300
Tom Bilyeu: That gets you fired up.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.650
Jay Samit: I'm like ... It was funny.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.790
The editor of my book said, "You know, you're
very competitive."

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.050
Because I never played sports, I go, "I'm
not competitive.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.150
I just have to win."

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:55.620
I never thought of myself as that.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.000
Then her other takeaway was "You know, this
is really a story about resilience."

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.920
And I'll go, "I'm not resilient.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.000
You just don't have any other choice."

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.300
The project and the changes that I'm working
on around the world, the governments that

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:11.490
I'm working with to change their culture because
we have an advantage.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.110
We actually embrace failure more than any
other country.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:22.920
My generation, it was I Love Lucy or Jackie
Gleason would have the get-rich-quick thing.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.700
Your generation, it was Homer Simpson.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.070
He's got this get-rich-quick scheme, it all
fails, and then life goes on.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:32.970
In the rest of the world, that life goes on
part isn't part of the dialogue.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:42.520
So we're a country that was made up of people
that came here overcoming odds for something

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.590
better.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.369
That's that basic pioneer spirit.

00:40:47.369 --> 00:40:53.940
Then at some point, we become a nation of
settlers that just settle for the way it is.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.150
We got to get more of that pioneer thing because
there's so much abundance, and it's not an

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.020
us-versus-them.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.150
Everybody can benefit.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.450
Why wouldn't you want that?

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:12.090
Tom Bilyeu: Talk to me about education because
you said that we educate our youth like it's

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.670
a scarcity mindset.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:22.550
Jay Samit: It's fill-in-the-blank, measure,
measure, measure that which can be measured.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.450
I'll do something I've never done on camera.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.490
I cheated myself out of a good college education.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:36.240
I went to a great university, UCLA, but I
was so focused on getting into graduate school

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.390
that the goal of those four years was how
do you get all A's?

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.970
The easiest way to get all A's is to take
the easiest courses.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:47.300
So I worked with the athletic department and
helped their athletes, and in exchange, I

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:55.460
got to take the classes that were set aside
for them, which instant A. But I never took

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.080
the classes of what I wanted to learn, and
what would've challenged me, and what would've

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080
grown.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.360
So took that approach, and I'll embarrass
one of my sons went to Brown.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.030
When he came to me and said, "Brown has no
required courses and no grades."

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.390
I'm going like, I thought of myself, I go,
"Oh, four years of partying."

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.630
Then I looked at it, and it's a market economy.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.030
Think of it for a second.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.980
The English department only gets funded if
kids take the English courses.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.750
Geology only gets funded ... No one's required
to take any of them.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.080
So you're only going to take the classes,
and there's no grade, so no risk, that you

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.170
hear are the most stimulated, most interesting,
greatest classes.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.340
So all the course and the quality of those
courses go up.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:39.560
As opposed to me taking rocks for jocks or
whatever simplistic thing that the person

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.950
teaching it hated teaching it, and the students
hated taking it, but it was just a tick box.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:50.500
If you can get out of that tick box mentality
... So Brown's completely changed the dynamic

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.760
and made it a buyer's markets where students
are the ones deciding which professors keep

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.010
a job because if nobody takes the class, it's
over.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.710
Tom Bilyeu: How important do you think a traditional
college education is today?

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:09.680
Jay Samit: I teach at a university, and one
of the ... Telling my students to drop out

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.760
is not good for the university and not the
right thing.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:24.980
For most people getting into lifelong debt,
it will not be a financial advantage.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.580
That's the truth.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:33.230
I have another son that did Princeton undergrad,
my kids are going to hate me for this, and

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.750
Harvard MBA.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:39.760
Basically, it was "Dad, no matter what I do
in life, I'll never starve because somebody

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.760
will hire that."

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.360
I go, "You're right."

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.750
It's two lines that get you through the sorting
process.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.470
But that's an individual choice.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.950
Not every path requires that.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:55.360
By the way, some of the most educated, brightest
people I know didn't get a formal education.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.290
Khan Academy, everything.

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:03.410
You can sit in front of that computer and
watch cats on a piano or the latest meme,

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:09.270
or learn to program, learn a new language,
be a master of some discipline.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:15.650
You're connected to mankind's complete history
of thought.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.240
So you can self educate.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:24.010
But for some jobs and some of that filter,
you won't get in the door unless they see

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.750
that college degree.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:33.280
We actually have a gap right now where several
million openings of jobs in the US that require

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.110
a college degree that there aren't applicants
for.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.130
The whole sharing economy, genius.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:43.380
A car spends most of its time parked.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.890
Why own something that sits there?

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:49.070
In my speeches around the world, the one thing
that gets people is I ask everybody, "How

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.270
many people own an electric drill?"

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:51.350
Do you own an electric drill?

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:52.350
Tom Bilyeu: Yes.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:56.260
Jay Samit: In your lifetime, according to
the drill makers association or whatever,

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.440
you'll drill for like 12 minutes.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.710
Tom Bilyeu: That's high for me, but ...
Jay Samit: You got the new bookshelf.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.710
Dee dee dee.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:04.710
That's it.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.000
If a drone could deliver it in the morning,
you do your thing and pick it up, you just

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.760
rent it.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.510
Rent the runway was renting fashion.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.390
A woman had to face this horrible choice.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.310
Spend all her money and get that one beautiful
dress and then be known as the girl in the

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.820
pink dress for the next 20 events.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.400
Or you could rent a different designer gown.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.850
Now that changes what's being manufactured
and all that.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.330
So there's so much opportunity.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:30.550
I'm like a kid in a candy store.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.490
Tom Bilyeu: What path do you plan to go down?

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.330
What things are you pursuing?

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.330
Is it ARVR?

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.900
Jay Samit: I'm super passionate about AR and
VR.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.890
I think it transforms the workplace.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.230
I'll give you a new way to think of how much
automation's going to change things.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.960
Have you ever sat like we're all little boys
inside and watched the big cranes on construction

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.960
sites?

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960
Tom Bilyeu: Of course.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.960
Jay Samit: That's a scary job.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.070
Some guy goes up there in the morning, sits
there with his coffee, reading, whatever.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:00.240
And at 10 o'clock, he's got to move the thing
from here to there.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.240
Then at noon, he moves another thing.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.080
I'm not making fun of the job.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.450
They blow over, and they die.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.920
But the thing about it, he's not looking out
the window moving the thing.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.470
He's looking at screens, and there's cameras.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.430
Why can't he be sitting in a studio like this,
like a drone operator?

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:16.430
Tom Bilyeu: Yeah, a great point.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.030
Jay Samit: Working on a crane in New York.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.890
Oh, they need to move something in Dubai?

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.010
No problem.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.660
Oh, need to move something in Shanghai?

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.000
Doesn't have to be there.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.790
Telepresence is what VR and AR is all about.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:28.960
Tom Bilyeu: Do you know the XPRIZE?

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:35.160
Tom Bilyeu: They actually have an XPRIZE coming
out called the Avatar XPRIZE exactly for that

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.160
kind of thing.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.160
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.460
ANA Airlines, I think is the sponsor of it.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.460
Yeah.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.460
Tom Bilyeu: Yes.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.460
Jay Samit: Yeah.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.869
Peter's a fan of the book, and I'm a fan of
his.

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:46.400
We do a lot of the same things.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:55.200
Yeah, and what a great way ... The whole concept
of the XPRIZE, of dangle a bunch of money

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.780
for something that seems impossible, and the
more money you dangle, the more possible it

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.780
becomes.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.780
Tom Bilyeu: Yeah.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.800
It goes back to what I think is your central
thesis, which there are all these problems.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.940
These problems are ultimately solvable, A,
and B, monetizable.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:14.630
That was the thing that drew me to the XPRIZE
is really looking for the huge opportunities

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.060
in the world's greatest challenges.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.680
It's really an incredible model.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.680
All right.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.980
Before we get to the final question, I have
one random question for you.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.980
Jay Samit: Okay.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.160
Tom Bilyeu: Do I understand correctly that
you're into magic?

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.420
Jay Samit: Yes.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.359
Tom Bilyeu: How'd you get into magic?

00:47:28.359 --> 00:47:30.010
Why are you into magic?

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.310
Jay Samit: Everybody has a hobby.

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:35.990
At four years old, I saw a magician.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:41.020
I thought it was the most amazing thing I
ever saw, both from the tricks that he did

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:46.930
and the power that that person standing on
the stage had over everybody else.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.210
It was the first time that I get to see adults
not understand their world.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:56.550
Something as a kid that you're used to, and
go, "Oh, they can't figure out what he's doing."

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.370
Turns out as an entrepreneur, it's probably
the greatest form of training that you can

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:01.370
have as a magician.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:02.370
Tom Bilyeu: Really?

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:06.060
Jay Samit: It's because when you go to see
a singer, you want to see them sing their

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.190
best.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.410
When you go to see a dancer, you want to see
them dance their best.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.820
When you go to see a magician, you want to
see him fuck up.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.250
So it's the only art form where the audience
is against them.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:17.450
They're trying to figure it out.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:23.850
If you can overcome that, convincing somebody
to put a song in a burger or sing at 35,000

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:25.100
feet, that's pretty easy.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.970
Magicians were used to win World War II.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.630
Magicians were used in the Iraq War.

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.730
We still call-
Tom Bilyeu: Are there examples?

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.609
Jay Samit: Oh, yeah.

00:48:33.609 --> 00:48:35.500
Lots of great stuff.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.040
The Nazis wanted to bomb the Suez Canal.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.950
Before fancy radar and stuff, you would eyeball
it.

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.900
They knew where Cairo was, they knew where
it was.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.680
So they would go out every night to bomb Cairo,
and they'd wake up the next day, and they

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.780
have spies in the city, and they go, "You
didn't bomb Cairo."

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.990
They come out the next night.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:55.369
What they did is they mapped out from aerial
where all the lights of Cairo were, go out

00:48:55.369 --> 00:48:59.231
in the desert, do the same thing, shuts off
all the lights in the city at night, and you

00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:00.560
bomb the wrong place.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.690
Tom Bilyeu: That's incredible.

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:02.690
Jay Samit: Anyway.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.700
I've talked about it endlessly.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.270
Support a magician.

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:07.270
It's a fun hobby.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.760
Tom Bilyeu: I've actually taken classes at
the Magic Castle and-

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.040
Jay Samit: Cool.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.810
Tom Bilyeu: I'm terrible and definitely am
not a member of Magic Castle, but-

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.490
Jay Samit: We'll go over and have fun.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.370
Tom Bilyeu: That would be amazing.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.530
Because I'm into close-up magic as well, the
first time you pull off a vanish, and you

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.859
can see like people's brains melt a little
bit.

00:49:24.859 --> 00:49:27.410
I remember when I first told people that I
was going to get into it and that I thought

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.580
it was really powerful from an entrepreneurial
standpoint, people were like, "What are you

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.040
talking about?"

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040
I said, "It's about understanding psychology.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:37.030
It's about understanding the way the body
works against you.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.310
Illusions, motion tracking.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.359
It all comes down to understanding the way
the human mind works."

00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:47.180
Jay Samit: It opens you to the possible because
you can't explain what you just saw, which

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.010
is what the mindset is to close any deal.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:54.280
There's something new that you don't know,
and now let's solve it together.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.460
Tom Bilyeu: All right.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.460
Last question.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.020
What's the impact that you want to have on
the world?

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:06.850
Jay Samit: I'm focusing, what I hope will
be the last third of my life, in trying to

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:13.900
help people be empowered, to build up this
global middle class, to have stable democracies.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:21.240
To me, it all comes from having entrepreneurs
be successful and building an entrepreneurial

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.240
class.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.170
All the innovations that we take for granted
were done by entrepreneurs.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:30.560
All the positive change that we're experiencing
comes from entrepreneurs.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.140
And we're not making enough of them.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:40.350
We can rattle off top famous athletes or top
famous movie stars, but we're not celebrating

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:45.260
those that took the risks and made our world
better.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:50.190
Really trying work with young people, work
with college kids, working people that hit

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.310
that midlife "What have I just done?

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:57.300
I've worked 20 years, and is that all there
is?"

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.550
That's what drives me.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:03.710
I'm fortunate to be in a position where I'm
able to focus on that.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:09.700
I appreciate you having me on and sharing
Disrupt You with your audience.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.920
It's now in eight languages.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.510
I'm humbled by the response and the daily
e-mails I get from around the world, and that

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.330
just drives me to work a little bit harder.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:21.870
Tom Bilyeu: If people want to reach out to
you, send you something, follow you, where

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.410
would they go?

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.450
Jay Samit: I'm easy to find.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.680
Jay Samit, my name, J-A-Y-S-A-M-I-T .com.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.290
Jaysamit on Twitter.

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:33.370
Facebook, LinkedIn.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:34.370
Reach out to me.

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.200
I'd love to hear from you.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.560
Anything that I can do to help you in your
journey to success.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560
That's what I'm about.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.580
Tom Bilyeu: Jay, thank you so much.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.340
I can't thank you enough for the book, for
everything you've done.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.340
Jay Samit: You're too kind.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.600
Tom Bilyeu: It's really, really incredible.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:53.180
Guys, this is somebody I promise you you're
going to want to dive deep into.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.180
Start with his book.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:57.360
It's certainly the easiest place, but he's
got a whole universe of interviews, content,

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360
everything.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.520
And he is going to teach you one of the most
empowering lessons that you will ever learn,

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.050
which is right before you.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.960
Right in front of your very eyes is something
that you're struggling with every day, and

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:12.700
in solving that problem, you can build a business,
you can learn something about yourself, you

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.910
can generate wealth, you can help other people.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.010
It really is incredible.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.680
The thing that I found most fascinating about
him is, even if you don't want to run your

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.310
own company and you want to work within a
company, and you want to generate change within,

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.070
this is something that he knows all about.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:29.619
The whole notion of spending other people's
money, but it comes down to the same problem.

00:52:29.619 --> 00:52:32.980
Find out what the problem is, find out the
people who share that problem, help solve

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.440
that problem, and you can get a lot of people
focused and moving on what you're doing.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.780
But you have to own that responsibility.

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:43.280
You have to remember that it's not up to them
to get it, it's up to you to explain it.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.180
My friends, please, I'm begging you.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.070
This is one of the most important books I've
ever read.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:50.200
If I had read this 10 years ago, it would've
accelerated my success.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.300
I cannot tell you how much.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.030
This is one of those books you will write
and thank this man.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.020
You will write me just for mentioning it.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.609
I'm telling you it's that strong.

00:52:57.609 --> 00:52:58.609
Check it out.

00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:59.609
It's called Disrupt You.

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:00.609
All right.

00:53:00.609 --> 00:53:01.609
This is a weekly show.

00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:02.609

Take care.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.890
Jay, thank you so much for coming on.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:08.930
What a pleasure, man.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.710
I'm honored.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.490
