00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
so the ability to accept death and look
 

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.630 align:start position:0%
so the ability to accept death and look
at<00:36:20.480><c> square</c><00:36:20.960><c> in</c><00:36:21.040><c> the</c><00:36:21.280><c> eye</c><00:36:21.680><c> and</c><00:36:21.920><c> accept</c><00:36:22.240><c> this</c><00:36:22.480><c> is</c>

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
at square in the eye and accept this is
 

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.470 align:start position:0%
at square in the eye and accept this is
your<00:36:22.880><c> reality</c><00:36:23.599><c> that</c><00:36:23.760><c> you're</c><00:36:24.000><c> not</c><00:36:24.240><c> going</c><00:36:24.400><c> to</c>

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
your reality that you're not going to

live forever is very liberating
 

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
live forever is very liberating
so

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.030 align:start position:0%

as a writer
you<00:36:57.839><c> have</c><00:36:58.160><c> shown</c><00:36:58.480><c> time</c><00:36:58.720><c> and</c><00:36:58.800><c> time</c><00:36:59.040><c> again</c><00:36:59.280><c> that</c>

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
you see things that are often
 

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.069 align:start position:0%
you see things that are often

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
so what what was it in that maybe that
 

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.510 align:start position:0%
so what what was it in that maybe that
even<00:37:04.720><c> surprised</c><00:37:05.200><c> you</c>

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.150 align:start position:0%

on a physical level was very weird
 

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.670 align:start position:0%

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
and um and then i was taken out of it at
 

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.190 align:start position:0%
and um and then i was taken out of it at

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i kind of freaked out
 

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.349 align:start position:0%
and i kind of freaked out
like<00:37:41.760><c> what's</c><00:37:42.079><c> happening</c><00:37:42.400><c> to</c><00:37:42.560><c> me</c><00:37:42.800><c> where</c><00:37:43.040><c> am</c><00:37:43.200><c> i</c>

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
like what's happening to me where am i
 

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:45.030 align:start position:0%
like what's happening to me where am i
what<00:37:43.520><c> happened</c><00:37:43.760><c> to</c><00:37:43.920><c> my</c><00:37:44.160><c> body</c>

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
what happened to my body
 

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
what happened to my body
so<00:37:45.280><c> it</c><00:37:45.280><c> was</c><00:37:45.440><c> a</c><00:37:45.520><c> kind</c><00:37:45.680><c> of</c><00:37:45.839><c> a</c><00:37:46.079><c> weird</c>

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
so it was a kind of a weird
