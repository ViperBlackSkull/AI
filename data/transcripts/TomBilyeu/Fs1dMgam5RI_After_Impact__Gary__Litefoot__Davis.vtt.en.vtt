00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:53.230 align:start position:0%
can kind of really tackle them
 

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.250 align:start position:0%
can kind of really tackle them

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:56.260 align:start position:0%
individually right and it's so logical
 

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.829 align:start position:0%
individually right and it's so logical
and<00:11:56.860><c> so</c><00:11:57.279><c> seemingly</c><00:11:57.850><c> straightforward</c><00:11:58.180><c> but</c><00:11:58.750><c> my</c>

and so seemingly straightforward but my
 

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
and so seemingly straightforward but my
question<00:11:59.200><c> to</c><00:11:59.320><c> you</c><00:11:59.350><c> is</c><00:11:59.470><c> why</c><00:12:00.279><c> do</c><00:12:00.339><c> you</c><00:12:00.399><c> think</c><00:12:00.459><c> it's</c>

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:00.670 align:start position:0%
question to you is why do you think it's
 

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.269 align:start position:0%
question to you is why do you think it's
so<00:12:00.910><c> hard</c><00:12:00.940><c> to</c><00:12:01.600><c> do</c><00:12:02.020><c> I</c><00:12:02.260><c> actually</c><00:12:02.860><c> don't</c><00:12:03.160><c> think</c>

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
so hard to do I actually don't think
 

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
so hard to do I actually don't think
it's<00:12:03.490><c> hard</c><00:12:03.640><c> to</c><00:12:03.730><c> do</c><00:12:03.910><c> I</c><00:12:04.120><c> here's</c><00:12:04.660><c> where</c><00:12:04.959><c> I</c><00:12:04.990><c> think</c>

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.170 align:start position:0%
it's hard to do I here's where I think
 

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.829 align:start position:0%
it's hard to do I here's where I think
people<00:12:05.920><c> either</c><00:12:06.580><c> can't</c><00:12:07.000><c> identify</c><00:12:07.180><c> the</c><00:12:07.540><c> steps</c>

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
people either can't identify the steps
 

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.230 align:start position:0%
people either can't identify the steps
okay<00:12:08.440><c> that</c><00:12:08.740><c> is</c><00:12:09.100><c> probably</c><00:12:09.370><c> crushingly</c>

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay that is probably crushingly
 

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.430 align:start position:0%
okay that is probably crushingly

you<00:14:35.800><c> go</c><00:14:36.100><c> you</c><00:14:36.460><c> trial</c><00:14:36.880><c> you</c><00:14:37.150><c> fail</c><00:14:37.450><c> you</c><00:14:37.900><c> learn</c><00:14:38.140><c> you</c>

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:43.180 align:start position:0%

you're on the road to entrepreneurship
you're<00:14:56.200><c> inevitably</c><00:14:56.380><c> going</c><00:14:56.680><c> to</c><00:14:56.950><c> have</c><00:14:57.040><c> to</c><00:14:57.339><c> pivot</c>

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're inevitably going to have to pivot

you're inevitably going to have to pivot
and<00:14:57.820><c> so</c><00:14:58.390><c> you</c><00:14:58.450><c> put</c><00:14:59.020><c> this</c><00:14:59.140><c> together</c><00:14:59.380><c> this</c><00:14:59.770><c> is</c><00:14:59.830><c> my</c>

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.470 align:start position:0%

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:07.209 align:start position:0%
steps then we have to pivot we have to
