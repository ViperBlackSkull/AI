00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
practice that you can slide into it so I
 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.140 align:start position:0%
practice that you can slide into it so I

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
find that really interesting so I would
 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.749 align:start position:0%
find that really interesting so I would

anxiety serves me is leading up to
 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.519 align:start position:0%
anxiety serves me is leading up to

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:40.529 align:start position:0%
something where it makes me it's low
 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:43.010 align:start position:0%
something where it makes me it's low
level<00:07:40.979><c> but</c><00:07:41.610><c> it</c><00:07:41.729><c> makes</c><00:07:41.909><c> me</c><00:07:42.120><c> take</c><00:07:42.300><c> it</c><00:07:42.449><c> seriously</c>

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 align:start position:0%

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
level but it makes me take it seriously
so<00:07:43.560><c> that</c><00:07:43.800><c> I</c><00:07:43.830><c> really</c><00:07:44.460><c> do</c><00:07:44.669><c> like</c><00:07:45.120><c> the</c><00:07:45.419><c> research</c>

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:45.930 align:start position:0%
so that I really do like the research
 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.140 align:start position:0%
so that I really do like the research
and<00:07:46.319><c> I</c><00:07:46.740><c> really</c><00:07:47.340><c> put</c><00:07:47.520><c> in</c><00:07:47.610><c> the</c><00:07:47.729><c> time</c><00:07:47.940><c> and</c><00:07:48.090><c> effort</c>

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 align:start position:0%
and I really put in the time and effort
 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.490 align:start position:0%
and I really put in the time and effort
because<00:07:48.509><c> I</c><00:07:48.569><c> don't</c><00:07:48.840><c> want</c><00:07:49.050><c> something</c><00:07:49.259><c> to</c><00:07:49.469><c> go</c>

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
because I don't want something to go
 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.529 align:start position:0%
because I don't want something to go
wrong<00:07:49.800><c> and</c><00:07:50.069><c> when</c><00:07:50.520><c> you</c><00:07:50.669><c> think</c><00:07:50.969><c> like</c><00:07:51.029><c> oh</c><00:07:51.330><c> I've</c>

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
wrong and when you think like oh I've
 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.719 align:start position:0%
wrong and when you think like oh I've
got<00:07:51.839><c> it</c><00:07:51.870><c> then</c><00:07:52.349><c> that's</c><00:07:52.589><c> also</c><00:07:52.889><c> when</c><00:07:53.250><c> people</c><00:07:53.550><c> fall</c>

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729 align:start position:0%
got it then that's also when people fall
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
got it then that's also when people fall
off<00:07:53.789><c> so</c><00:07:54.330><c> there</c><00:07:54.509><c> is</c><00:07:54.659><c> like</c><00:07:54.930><c> this</c><00:07:55.229><c> middle</c><00:07:56.159><c> range</c>

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:56.370 align:start position:0%
off so there is like this middle range
 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.670 align:start position:0%
off so there is like this middle range
where<00:07:56.789><c> you</c><00:07:56.909><c> want</c><00:07:57.120><c> to</c><00:07:57.240><c> be</c><00:07:57.360><c> aroused</c><00:07:57.990><c> enough</c><00:07:58.469><c> that</c>

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
where you want to be aroused enough that
 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
where you want to be aroused enough that

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're taking it seriously that you're

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
get into flow and that is and and I'm
very<00:08:08.279><c> much</c><00:08:08.460><c> processing</c><00:08:09.120><c> out</c><00:08:09.210><c> loud</c><00:08:09.389><c> here</c><00:08:09.800><c> that</c>

very much processing out loud here that
 

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.860 align:start position:0%
very much processing out loud here that

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:12.870 align:start position:0%
is an interesting part of flow that they
 

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.510 align:start position:0%
is an interesting part of flow that they

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
say the stakes have to be high and that
 

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.950 align:start position:0%
say the stakes have to be high and that

if the stakes aren't high enough if
 

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
if the stakes aren't high enough if

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.210 align:start position:0%
there isn't enough arousal for you to
 

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.149 align:start position:0%
there isn't enough arousal for you to

00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
switch into flow then you're really
 

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
switch into flow then you're really
going<00:08:20.279><c> to</c><00:08:20.339><c> be</c><00:08:20.400><c> in</c><00:08:20.520><c> trouble</c><00:08:20.639><c> but</c><00:08:21.060><c> and</c><00:08:21.629><c> so</c><00:08:22.440><c> from</c>

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:22.650 align:start position:0%
going to be in trouble but and so from
 

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
going to be in trouble but and so from

begins rapidly degrading when you get
 

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.529 align:start position:0%
begins rapidly degrading when you get

00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:43.969 align:start position:0%
start working on that
 

00:20:43.969 --> 00:20:46.029 align:start position:0%
start working on that
so<00:20:44.210><c> is</c><00:20:44.479><c> there</c><00:20:44.749><c> do</c><00:20:45.409><c> you</c><00:20:45.499><c> think</c><00:20:45.679><c> there's</c><00:20:45.830><c> one</c>

00:21:00.639 --> 00:21:00.649 align:start position:0%
development is buying into the
