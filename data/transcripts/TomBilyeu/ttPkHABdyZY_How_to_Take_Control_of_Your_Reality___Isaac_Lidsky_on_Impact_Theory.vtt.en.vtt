00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:08.259 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna guess was the hardest one like
 

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:10.769 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna guess was the hardest one like
you'd<00:23:08.409><c> so</c><00:23:08.980><c> that</c><00:23:09.639><c> was</c><00:23:09.789><c> a</c><00:23:09.820><c> tough</c><00:23:10.059><c> invested</c><00:23:10.629><c> like</c>

00:23:10.769 --> 00:23:10.779 align:start position:0%
you'd so that was a tough invested like
 

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:13.259 align:start position:0%
you'd so that was a tough invested like
