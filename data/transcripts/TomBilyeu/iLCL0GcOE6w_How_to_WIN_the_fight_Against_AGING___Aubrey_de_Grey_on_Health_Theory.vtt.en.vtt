so<00:04:24.080><c> yeah</c><00:04:24.400><c> by</c><00:04:24.639><c> 10</c><00:04:24.800><c> years</c><00:04:25.040><c> ago</c><00:04:25.360><c> it</c><00:04:25.440><c> was</c><00:04:25.680><c> over</c><00:04:26.080><c> i</c>

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah by 10 years ago it was over i
 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
so yeah by 10 years ago it was over i
had<00:04:26.400><c> won</c><00:04:26.560><c> the</c><00:04:26.840><c> argument</c><00:04:27.759><c> um</c>

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
had won the argument um
 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.710 align:start position:0%
had won the argument um
yeah<00:04:29.040><c> so</c><00:04:29.199><c> when</c><00:04:29.360><c> i</c><00:04:29.440><c> came</c><00:04:29.600><c> along</c><00:04:29.840><c> 20</c><00:04:30.160><c> years</c><00:04:30.400><c> ago</c>

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so when i came along 20 years ago
 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.469 align:start position:0%
yeah so when i came along 20 years ago
and<00:04:30.880><c> said</c><00:04:31.360><c> listen</c><00:04:31.600><c> we</c><00:04:31.759><c> could</c><00:04:31.919><c> do</c><00:04:32.080><c> this</c><00:04:32.160><c> damage</c>

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
and said listen we could do this damage
 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
and said listen we could do this damage
repair<00:04:32.960><c> thing</c><00:04:33.280><c> we</c><00:04:33.440><c> could</c><00:04:33.680><c> actually</c><00:04:34.320><c> turn</c><00:04:34.639><c> back</c>

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
repair thing we could actually turn back
 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.790 align:start position:0%
repair thing we could actually turn back
the<00:04:35.120><c> aging</c><00:04:35.600><c> clock</c><00:04:35.919><c> and</c><00:04:36.000><c> it</c><00:04:36.080><c> might</c><00:04:36.400><c> it</c><00:04:36.560><c> should</c>

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
the aging clock and it might it should
 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.629 align:start position:0%
the aging clock and it might it should
be<00:04:37.040><c> easier</c><00:04:37.440><c> to</c><00:04:37.600><c> do</c><00:04:37.840><c> that</c>

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
be easier to do that
 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.749 align:start position:0%
be easier to do that
than

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
than
 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
than
to<00:04:40.080><c> slow</c><00:04:40.400><c> the</c><00:04:40.560><c> clock</c><00:04:40.960><c> down</c><00:04:41.520><c> which</c><00:04:41.759><c> is</c><00:04:41.919><c> what</c>

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
to slow the clock down which is what
 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
to slow the clock down which is what
people<00:04:42.400><c> have</c><00:04:42.479><c> been</c><00:04:42.720><c> trying</c><00:04:42.960><c> to</c><00:04:43.040><c> do</c><00:04:43.199><c> before</c>

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%

the biology of aging and that of course
 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
the biology of aging and that of course
meant<00:04:57.440><c> that</c><00:04:57.600><c> the</c><00:04:57.680><c> people</c><00:04:57.840><c> who</c><00:04:58.000><c> were</c><00:04:58.080><c> studying</c>

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
meant that the people who were studying
 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.830 align:start position:0%
meant that the people who were studying
the<00:04:58.400><c> biology</c><00:04:58.800><c> of</c><00:04:58.960><c> aging</c><00:04:59.199><c> didn't</c><00:04:59.440><c> know</c><00:04:59.600><c> about</c>

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
the biology of aging didn't know about
 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.310 align:start position:0%
the biology of aging didn't know about
them<00:05:00.080><c> so</c><00:05:00.240><c> there</c><00:05:00.400><c> was</c><00:05:00.560><c> a</c><00:05:00.720><c> lot</c><00:05:00.960><c> of</c><00:05:01.360><c> you</c><00:05:01.440><c> know</c><00:05:02.000><c> um</c>

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
them so there was a lot of you know um
 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.030 align:start position:0%
them so there was a lot of you know um
getting<00:05:02.639><c> up</c><00:05:02.800><c> speed</c><00:05:03.440><c> involved</c><00:05:04.000><c> in</c><00:05:04.080><c> this</c>

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
getting up speed involved in this
 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
getting up speed involved in this
um

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.990 align:start position:0%
um
but<00:05:06.240><c> yeah</c><00:05:06.400><c> i</c><00:05:06.479><c> mean</c><00:05:06.720><c> just</c><00:05:06.880><c> the</c><00:05:07.039><c> general</c><00:05:07.440><c> concept</c>

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
but yeah i mean just the general concept
 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.790 align:start position:0%
but yeah i mean just the general concept
even<00:05:08.160><c> in</c><00:05:08.240><c> the</c><00:05:08.400><c> abstract</c><00:05:09.120><c> that</c><00:05:10.000><c> reversing</c>

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
even in the abstract that reversing
 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.189 align:start position:0%
even in the abstract that reversing
aging<00:05:11.280><c> could</c><00:05:11.520><c> be</c><00:05:11.759><c> easier</c><00:05:12.320><c> than</c><00:05:12.639><c> retarding</c>

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
aging could be easier than retarding
 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.350 align:start position:0%
aging could be easier than retarding
aging<00:05:13.759><c> just</c><00:05:14.000><c> sounds</c><00:05:14.400><c> wrong</c><00:05:14.880><c> it</c><00:05:14.960><c> sounds</c><00:05:15.199><c> like</c>

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
aging just sounds wrong it sounds like
 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.189 align:start position:0%
aging just sounds wrong it sounds like
reversing<00:05:15.840><c> aging</c><00:05:16.160><c> is</c><00:05:16.320><c> a</c><00:05:16.400><c> bigger</c><00:05:16.800><c> thing</c><00:05:17.120><c> and</c>

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
reversing aging is a bigger thing and
 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.189 align:start position:0%
reversing aging is a bigger thing and
therefore<00:05:17.520><c> it's</c><00:05:17.680><c> got</c><00:05:17.840><c> to</c><00:05:18.000><c> be</c><00:05:18.160><c> harder</c>

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
therefore it's got to be harder
 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.749 align:start position:0%
therefore it's got to be harder
and<00:05:19.680><c> um</c><00:05:20.240><c> so</c><00:05:20.400><c> yeah</c><00:05:20.639><c> the</c><00:05:20.800><c> id</c><00:05:21.199><c> all</c><00:05:21.360><c> i</c><00:05:21.440><c> had</c><00:05:21.520><c> to</c><00:05:21.600><c> get</c>

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
and um so yeah the id all i had to get
 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
and um so yeah the id all i had to get
across<00:05:22.160><c> really</c><00:05:22.400><c> was</c><00:05:22.639><c> that</c>

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
across really was that
 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.590 align:start position:0%
across really was that
when<00:05:23.680><c> we're</c><00:05:23.919><c> slowing</c><00:05:24.400><c> aging</c><00:05:24.800><c> down</c><00:05:25.120><c> we</c><00:05:25.360><c> are</c>

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
when we're slowing aging down we are
 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.230 align:start position:0%
when we're slowing aging down we are

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
interfering with the processes that
 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.749 align:start position:0%

drive<00:05:28.639><c> aging</c>

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
drive aging
 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.070 align:start position:0%
drive aging
whereas<00:05:30.160><c> when</c><00:05:30.400><c> we</c><00:05:30.639><c> are</c><00:05:30.800><c> reversing</c><00:05:31.440><c> aging</c><00:05:31.919><c> we</c>

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
whereas when we are reversing aging we
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.830 align:start position:0%
whereas when we are reversing aging we

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.190 align:start position:0%
what do you mean
right<00:13:23.120><c> yeah</c><00:13:23.600><c> okay</c><00:13:23.920><c> so</c><00:13:24.079><c> let</c><00:13:24.240><c> me</c><00:13:24.399><c> give</c><00:13:24.560><c> a</c><00:13:24.720><c> nice</c>

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay so let me give a nice
 

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.269 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay so let me give a nice
like<00:13:25.440><c> a</c><00:13:25.519><c> bit</c><00:13:25.680><c> of</c><00:13:25.760><c> background</c><00:13:26.320><c> to</c><00:13:26.560><c> it</c>

like a bit of background to it
so

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.069 align:start position:0%

um

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.750 align:start position:0%
um
we<00:13:37.760><c> can</c><00:13:38.160><c> therefore</c><00:13:38.720><c> say</c>

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
we can therefore say
 

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.949 align:start position:0%
we can therefore say

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
um but i said
yeah<00:31:11.039><c> maybe</c><00:31:11.279><c> you</c><00:31:11.360><c> gave</c><00:31:11.520><c> up</c><00:31:11.600><c> a</c><00:31:11.679><c> little</c><00:31:11.840><c> too</c>

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
mutation in that gene right because then
 

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.310 align:start position:0%
mutation in that gene right because then
they're<00:36:52.480><c> not</c><00:36:52.640><c> making</c><00:36:52.880><c> the</c><00:36:53.040><c> protein</c><00:36:53.680><c> so</c><00:36:54.000><c> yeah</c>

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
they're not making the protein so yeah
 

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.750 align:start position:0%
they're not making the protein so yeah
so<00:36:54.640><c> um</c>

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.430 align:start position:0%
so um
and<00:36:55.920><c> also</c><00:36:56.160><c> of</c><00:36:56.240><c> course</c><00:36:56.480><c> there's</c><00:36:56.800><c> the</c><00:36:56.960><c> viral</c>

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
and also of course there's the viral
 

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.589 align:start position:0%
and also of course there's the viral
proteins<00:36:57.920><c> itself</c><00:36:58.400><c> you</c><00:36:58.480><c> know</c><00:36:58.800><c> the</c><00:36:58.960><c> capsid</c><00:36:59.520><c> or</c>

00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
proteins itself you know the capsid or
 

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:02.230 align:start position:0%
proteins itself you know the capsid or
whatever<00:37:00.400><c> but</c><00:37:00.560><c> yeah</c><00:37:00.800><c> you</c><00:37:00.880><c> can</c><00:37:01.040><c> just</c><00:37:01.280><c> do</c><00:37:01.920><c> um</c>

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
whatever but yeah you can just do um
 

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.230 align:start position:0%
whatever but yeah you can just do um

which is the target in this case
um<00:37:35.839><c> and</c><00:37:36.000><c> they</c><00:37:36.240><c> basically</c><00:37:36.640><c> just</c><00:37:36.880><c> extract</c><00:37:37.359><c> it</c>

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
um and they basically just extract it
 

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:39.430 align:start position:0%
um and they basically just extract it
they<00:37:37.839><c> basically</c><00:37:38.160><c> kind</c><00:37:38.320><c> of</c><00:37:38.560><c> solubilize</c><00:37:39.200><c> it</c><00:37:39.359><c> if</c>

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
they basically kind of solubilize it if
 

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.630 align:start position:0%
they basically kind of solubilize it if
you<00:37:39.520><c> like</c><00:37:39.760><c> and</c><00:37:39.839><c> bring</c><00:37:40.079><c> it</c><00:37:40.240><c> out</c><00:37:40.400><c> into</c><00:37:40.560><c> the</c>

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
you like and bring it out into the
 

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
you like and bring it out into the
circulation<00:37:41.599><c> so</c><00:37:41.760><c> that</c><00:37:41.920><c> it</c><00:37:42.000><c> gets</c><00:37:42.240><c> excreted</c>

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
circulation so that it gets excreted
 

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.030 align:start position:0%
circulation so that it gets excreted
through<00:37:42.960><c> the</c><00:37:43.200><c> um</c><00:37:43.520><c> through</c><00:37:43.760><c> the</c><00:37:43.839><c> kidney</c>

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
through the um through the kidney
 

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
through the um through the kidney
and<00:37:45.200><c> of</c><00:37:45.280><c> course</c><00:37:45.440><c> that's</c><00:37:45.920><c> that's</c><00:37:46.240><c> just</c><00:37:46.480><c> as</c><00:37:46.640><c> good</c>

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
and of course that's that's just as good
 

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
and of course that's that's just as good
as<00:37:47.440><c> breaking</c><00:37:47.839><c> it</c><00:37:47.920><c> down</c><00:37:48.320><c> right</c><00:37:48.640><c> it</c><00:37:48.800><c> means</c><00:37:49.040><c> it's</c>

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
as breaking it down right it means it's
 

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.750 align:start position:0%
as breaking it down right it means it's
gone<00:37:50.240><c> so</c><00:37:50.560><c> yeah</c><00:37:50.800><c> this</c><00:37:50.960><c> is</c><00:37:51.119><c> a</c><00:37:51.200><c> really</c><00:37:51.359><c> cool</c><00:37:51.599><c> way</c>

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
gone so yeah this is a really cool way
 

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.910 align:start position:0%

so lots of things accumulate there which

they<00:39:50.720><c> would</c><00:39:50.880><c> be</c><00:39:51.040><c> touched</c><00:39:51.680><c> so</c><00:39:51.839><c> all</c><00:39:52.000><c> we</c><00:39:52.160><c> have</c><00:39:52.320><c> to</c>

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
they would be touched so all we have to
 

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
they would be touched so all we have to
do<00:39:52.560><c> is</c><00:39:52.720><c> get</c><00:39:52.800><c> them</c><00:39:52.960><c> inside</c><00:39:53.280><c> the</c><00:39:53.440><c> cell</c><00:39:53.760><c> and</c><00:39:53.920><c> it</c>

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
do is get them inside the cell and it
 

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.589 align:start position:0%
do is get them inside the cell and it
turns<00:39:54.240><c> out</c><00:39:54.320><c> that</c><00:39:54.560><c> we</c><00:39:54.640><c> can</c><00:39:54.800><c> do</c><00:39:54.960><c> that</c><00:39:55.280><c> with</c><00:39:55.520><c> the</c>

00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
turns out that we can do that with the
 

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.589 align:start position:0%
turns out that we can do that with the

00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
essentially trick the body into thinking
 

00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:02.470 align:start position:0%
essentially trick the body into thinking

that the material is foreign and engulf
 

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.390 align:start position:0%
that the material is foreign and engulf

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
it like it with a bacterium and that
 

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.069 align:start position:0%
it like it with a bacterium and that

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
takes it inside the cell and then it's
 

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
takes it inside the cell and then it's
