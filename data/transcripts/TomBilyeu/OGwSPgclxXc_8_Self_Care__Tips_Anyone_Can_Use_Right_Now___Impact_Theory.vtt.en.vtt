00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 align:start position:0%

no other reason to have a brain except

no other reason to have a brain except

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 align:start position:0%
to interact with the world and even like
 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
to interact with the world and even like
thinking<00:06:48.010><c> is</c><00:06:48.280><c> subservient</c><00:06:48.760><c> to</c><00:06:49.120><c> our</c><00:06:49.210><c> ability</c>

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 align:start position:0%
thinking is subservient to our ability
 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
thinking is subservient to our ability

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.370 align:start position:0%
to engage with the world
and<00:06:51.160><c> so</c><00:06:51.580><c> basically</c><00:06:52.000><c> we</c><00:06:52.270><c> have</c><00:06:52.390><c> a</c><00:06:52.419><c> brain</c><00:06:52.780><c> that</c>

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 align:start position:0%
and so basically we have a brain that
 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.710 align:start position:0%
and so basically we have a brain that

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:41.830 align:start position:0%
way better then what I've actually here
 

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
way better then what I've actually here
and<00:12:41.920><c> and</c><00:12:42.430><c> that</c><00:12:42.580><c> wasn't</c><00:12:42.760><c> even</c><00:12:43.000><c> fun</c><00:12:43.210><c> was</c><00:12:43.450><c> it</c><00:12:43.570><c> even</c>

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:43.690 align:start position:0%

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.370 align:start position:0%
worth it and now it's never enough it's
 

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
worth it and now it's never enough it's
