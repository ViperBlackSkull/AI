00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.640
Tom: Hey everybody.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.670
Welcome to "Impact Theory."

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.930
You're here because you believe that human
potential is nearly limitless, but you know

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.800
that having potential is not the same as doing
something with it.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.890
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and amazing ideas

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.180
that are gonna help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.600
All right.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.160
Today's guest defies the convention of all
my normal intros.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.309
Reading a list of his accomplishments would
be to miss the point entirely.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.040
While he is the Emmy-nominated host of "Brain
Games," the highest-rated show in NatGeo's

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.190
history, airing in 45 languages across 171
countries, this modern-day performance philosopher

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.140
and filmmaker cannot be described in terms
of demographics in viewership; he must be

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.140
experienced.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.410
You have to let him crawl inside your mind,
clear the cobwebs, and paint on the walls

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.489
of your brain like an artistic cave-dweller,
showing you a vision of the world not as it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.130
is, but as it could be.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.630
His infectious optimism has earned him the
name of "Wonder Junkie," but from where I'm

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.510
sitting, he is the "Wonder Dealer."

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.180
His shots of awe will leave anyone scratching
for more.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.030
He spins ideas into a magical tapestry of
intellectual ecstasy like an Ibiza DJ in the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.640
height of their powers.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.759
His beautiful, transcendent, and paradigm-shifting
micro-documentaries may be born out of existential

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.289
anxiety, but they so manifestly capture the
agony and ecstasy of the human experience

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.890
that they've been viewed over 100 million
times.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.729
His poetic, cosmological musings smash together
Shakespearean drama with Sagan-esque profundity

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.460
like the Hadron Collider smashes particles,
resulting in the same degree of revelatory

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.460
fireworks.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.579
So, please, help me in welcoming the host
of the all new National Geographic show about

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.820
the birth and rise of the human species itself,
"Origins."

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.940
The one, and I assure you, only, Jason Silva.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.040
Hi there, welcome.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.100
It's so good to have you here.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.560
Jason: Thank you for having me back.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560
Tom: Absolutely.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Jason: Thank you for that introduction.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.629
Tom: That is truly, truly a pleasure.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.379
Writing that for you, you have no idea, that
was the most fun I've ever had writing an

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.379
intro.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.340
I was a wee bit indulgent in my desire to
have beautiful language, but I think you warrant

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.340
it.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.069
Jason: I appreciate that, and it gives me
chills to know that my work has touched you

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.730
that way, because I sense a kindred spirit,
and something that I share with you is an

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.760
enthusiasm to celebrate those that have touched
me and inspired me.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.000
You've heard me ranting and raving about Steven
Kotler and Jamie Wheal, and the folks behind

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.090
Neurohacker that I was telling you about before.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.319
I can't overemphasize my passion for those
that have affected me, and I think a lot of

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.580
the fuel for my work is simply a desire to
give back in some fundamental way.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.970
I have been shaken by literature, and ideas,
and media, and film, and individuals across

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.970
the world.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.319
I have been shaken and touched with such a
profound intensity that I have had no choice

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.010
but to respond in some way.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.409
One of my favorite thinkers, Ernest Becker,
used to say, "The difference between the artist

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:54.549
and the neurotic is that the neurotic is precisely
the one who cannot create.

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.189
He chokes in his introversion."

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.189
Tom: Ah, that's actually real interesting.

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.239
Jason: Yeah, but the neurotic and the artist
are both super sensitive; they both take in

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.910
the world with intensity.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.950
But, again, the neurotic cannot create, so
he chokes on his introversions, whereas the

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.170
artist takes in the world and reworks it into
his art.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.930
That's really my attempt and my inspiration.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.550
I see that you are, in turn, doing that as
well, because I sensed artistry in your passions,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.690
so thank you for that intro.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.690
Thank you.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.290
Tom: Dude, truly my pleasure.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.200
One of the things that you lend credence to
in a way that I love, is the notion of being

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.800
an artist, being such a valid form of expression.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.870
Growing up in the 80s, anyway, artists were
made fun of, right?

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.690
And that was, if you wanted to paint the picture
of the boyfriend who was not worthy of the

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.530
daughter in the movie, you just made him an
artist, right?

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.530
Jason: Okay.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.190
Tom: And that was an easy way to dismiss him.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.650
Jason: To dismiss somebody, because if you
couldn't sell it, if it couldn't be turned

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.060
into a commodity that had value in our capitalist
system, then it was dismissed.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.080
"Oh, he's just a struggling artist," something
to be looked down upon.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080
Tom: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.650
But when you talk about artists as being something
that they're really playing a role in society,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.290
and they take in the world, they repackage
it, and make it, I'll say, "Experienceable"?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.440
You've never used that word?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.960
That's how it feels to me.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.960
Jason: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.800
Well, Marshall McLuhan, the media theorist,
used to say, "It's always been the artist

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.010
who recognizes that the future is the present
and uses his work to prepare the grounds for

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:31.450
it," so I've always felt that artistic interpretation
is precisely that: it's interpretation, it's

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.360
a focus on subjective experience, and intersubjectivity.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.040
To experience art is to experience another
mind.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.270
I think that the fraud of objectivity in the
world- I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.440
about empirical science and objectivity, but
I also believe that to dismiss the only point

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.060
of view we ever really get to know, which
is first person subjectivity ... to so easily

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.330
dismiss that is a wrong in our society.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.590
What I love about art is that it emphasizes
the POV, it emphasizes the interpretation.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.850
What I like about cinema even more than documentaries,
for example, is that cinema allows us to enter

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.460
the mind of somebody else for real.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.270
Art is the lie that reveals the truth.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.730
That's just what speaks to me, and so my videos,
I may be talking to the camera, they may technically

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:32.100
be vlogging videos, but I aspire for them
to be more cinematic and filmlike than to

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.900
pretend to be anything objective or empirical.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.390
Tom: Which I love, because when you say that,
it's not a step down in value.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.710
What I find so interesting, and I just had
the very good fortune of--for anyone out there

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.720
who's a fan of Jason Silva like I am--of watching
three of his new videos that haven't been

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720
released yet.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.300
Oh my god, they're so good.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.491
In one of them, there's a moment where you're
cut so that you're facing yourself, and you're

00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:01.570
talking about duality.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.840
What I love is, you really do sit at this
intersection which I find incredibly useful,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.900
which is, you recognize both the power of
the co-authored narrative of life, right?

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.120
Co-authoring the things you believe about
yourself.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.640
You've talked very profoundly about the malleability
of the past through memories, and how we can

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.890
all change those.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.710
But also, you're incredibly respected in the
scientific community, and I know that you

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.740
get outreach from a lot of very high-level
thinkers.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.570
You were on Star Talk with Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.690
People see that you can help people experience
both, right?

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.510
You can help people experience those moments
that can only be- In fact, I wore this shirt,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.280
which is Carl Sagan, in your honor.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.980
Jason: "Billions and billions."

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.860
Tom: Yes, because you have quoted him, and
just ... I don't know, you, seeing your reverence

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.780
for him and his work is really fascinating
to me.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.690
You get somebody like this, who's really driven
by data, by science, but he so saw the beauty

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.580
in it, that I think your words were, "When
you hear Carl Sagan talking rhapsodic about

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.220
the universe, it sounds like he's coming."

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.570
You get that.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.180
He's so enraptured with that moment.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:17.120
That duality that you represent, it's interesting
to me, and the reason it's interesting to

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.520
me ... I'm the guy that's trying to show people
how they don't have to choose between executing

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.780
a business, living at the highest levels,
being the best in their field, whatever.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.430
You can want to be the best parent, the fastest
runner of all time, astronaut, or business

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.870
leader; that, to me, is irrelevant, but you
truly, you're willing to say, "I want to be

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.479
the greatest of all time at that."

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:47.160
Being able to show people that I'm not choosing
between being an artist, being in love with

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.160
ideas.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.750
In fact, people always give me credit for
being well-researched or whatever, it's because

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.769
I love the ideas.

00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:53.319
I'm chasing my bliss.

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:56.279
I'm following something that I find innately
interesting.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:09:03.670
What I really hope they take away from you
is that duality, that intersection of, "This

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.220
is a true futurist who understands the technology
and can talk as powerfully about hard science

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.949
and exponential curves, and where it's all
going, as he can," and I'm sure we will today,

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:19.040
"about psilocybin, about mystical experience,
about the ephemeral things that make this

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040
life worth living."

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.339
Jason: I think that it's interesting you mention
Carl Sagan; I do love him, and I have said

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:32.899
that to see him talk, or to hear his words
when he's narrating "The Pale Blue Dot," the

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:35.529
sense of awe and the sense of reverence is
clear.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:42.750
The reason I said it sounds like he's having
a cognitive orgasm is very real, and that's

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:51.970
a feeling, I think, that I chase as an existentialist:
this acute and agonizing self-awareness about

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.770
the human condition.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:03.699
The paralyzing fear, the paralyzing incongruity
of mortal creatures who dream of immortality.

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:08.199
To have emerged from nothing, to have a name,
consciousness of self, deep inter-feeling,

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:12.850
an excruciating inner yearning and desire
for self-expression, and yet with all this

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.139
yet to die.

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:16.389
We are simultaneously infinite and finite.

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:21.920
Tolstoy used to say, "Man cannot live if he
can't find a way to bridge the infinite with

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920
the finite."

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.680
That is the human condition.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.110
I think that one of the ways that we do that
is by broadening our understanding of what

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.519
is; peering beyond the possible.

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.670
Maybe there's something beyond this mortal
coil.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.160
Carl Sagan said it best: through that inquiry,
we actually get off.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.769
He said, "Understanding is a kind of ecstasy."

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:50.089
So, even when he's talking about science--an
objective, empirical measurement of the world,

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:54.319
and the scientific process, and the importance
of not falling into dogma--even he is saying

00:10:54.319 --> 00:11:00.600
that when you experience revelation, when
a subjective mind experiences what seems like

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.930
an objective truth, that becomes an ecstatic
experience to that subjective mind.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:15.189
There is pleasure in understanding, so I don't
think we should hide that or dilute that fact.

00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:20.819
When scientists are really dry when conveying
something amazing, I think they lose half

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:22.759
their audience, you know what I mean?

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:23.759
Tom: Yes.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:24.759
You've seen "Contact," right?

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:26.730
Jason: I love that movie, thank you for bringing
it up.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.940
Tom: Now, you know when Ellie says ... she's
going through the wormhole and she says, "They

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.999
should've sent a poet"?

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:32.999
Jason: Yes.

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:33.999
My favorite.

00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:37.009
Tom: The line should be, "They should've sent
Jason Silva."

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:38.709
And I mean that.

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:45.499
When I think about what you were saying about
the academics, they lose their audience.

00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:51.160
What I love about the Neil deGrasse Tyson
story is he meets Carl Sagan, Carl Sagan changes

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.819
his life by showing him kindness, and really
sitting and listening to him, and helps him

00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:59.879
tap into the rapture that is that field of
study.

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:06.110
When I hear an idea, and then I hear that
same idea interpreted through you, I can feel

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.110
that idea.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:12.699
There's so much power in being able to communicate
feeling, and one thing I want to do, I want

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:14.839
to put you in context for people, because
they're seeing you now, right?

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:21.629
They're seeing you in 2017, and you make sense
in 2017, but you don't make sense when you

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:27.040
first started doing "Shots of Awe" however
many years ago, and vlogging wasn't a thing,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.959
and people weren't doing micro-documentaries.

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:36.320
No one was thinking of extemporaneously- You're
essentially like an improv rapper that takes

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.829
these really complicated ideas, synthesizes
them into this flow.

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:41.960
Flow on both levels.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.000
The Steven Kotler, Jamie Weal idea of flow.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.279
Flow Genome, [inaudible 00:12:47], but also
the notion of flow as in my flow when I'm

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.740
rapping, which is fucking unbelievable.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:59.149
You go on these lyrical journeys through this
idea, smashing these things together.

00:12:59.149 --> 00:13:03.709
When I was writing the intro for you, that
notion of smashing particles together, ideas

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:08.850
together in this way that you're able to synthesize
those things, is so incredible, and the reason

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.689
I'm really belaboring this point is because
I want people to understand, all around them

00:13:11.689 --> 00:13:16.629
right now are these unbelievable ideas that
they're not seeing because they're not speaking

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.389
in the language of emotion.

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:21.600
They're not tapping into actually feeling
something about it.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.569
Going back to, I want them to see you as the
alien they can all be, right?

00:13:27.569 --> 00:13:34.509
Because you actually dared to be you when
it was super fucking weird, and I'm sure people

00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:38.689
must have been like, "What is guy doing talking
to camera, going"- Because there are times

00:13:38.689 --> 00:13:42.370
I see people in the background, so I know
you're not in some super isolated thing, you're

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.319
being a crazy man on the edge of some sea
cliff somewhere.

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:50.190
Jason: And the camera gave me the psychological
permission slip to do that, so if I was doing

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.110
that same thing, ranting and raving to myself
without somebody filing me, then there'd be

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.120
no difference between me and the crazy man.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:05.459
It's always been about finding ways to legitimize
these meanderings, and diving into free association,

00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:08.970
which is what these riffs are in my videos.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.999
It's stream-of-consciousness in a very real
sense.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:18.910
I try to put myself in an altered state before
I do it, and you talk about flow, whether

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:25.389
you're a freestyle rapper in flow, or a jazz
musician, or an elite athlete, flow is characterized

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:31.180
by getting outside yourself, and by "Outside
yourself," I mean "Beyond the monkey mind,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.399
beyond the inner chatter, beyond the inner
critic and the questioning mind, the successive

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:40.589
rumination and self-consciousness that keeps
you deliberating whether you should ever get

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:42.459
out and do something.

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:47.809
Just overthinking, and too much scenario planning,
too much neocortical hardware, as Jamie Weal

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:48.809
calls it.

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:53.649
Cul-de-sacs and error messages running on
repeat in your brain and holding you back.

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:58.709
We've all suffered from anxiety, and self-consciousness,
and even depression all stem from excessive

00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:02.350
rumination, but when you finally catch that
wave and you're the surfer, there's no time

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:07.100
to think anymore, you just start being; the
doer and the seer merge.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.009
The other thing that happens when you're in
flow is you're sense of time disappears, so

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:15.009
there's selflessness, there's timelessness,
there's a sense of effortlessness in flow,

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:16.550
and there's a sense of information richness.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:22.300
The kind of associations you're able to make--creativity
is just connecting things--increases, and

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:28.399
for somebody like me, whose disposition is
timid, and who would clearly identify in my

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:33.889
childhood as somebody who is really self-conscious,
like, just thinks too much, right?

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:38.980
Sometimes in a way that was not useful to
me, socially and/or creatively.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.980
I was a stiff.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.050
I was uptight.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.649
I was the guy who never danced at parties.

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:48.459
So everybody's having ecstatic moment of no-mind
on the dance floor, and I'm just thinking,

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:49.740
"Oh, I'm not gonna do that.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.579
I'll look silly," worried about what other
people think, and so on and so forth.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:16:00.000
Sometimes it takes finding the right tool,
or instrument, or medium that you fall in

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.759
love with so much, that is stronger than your
self-consciousness and your resistance, so

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.730
that you can finally break through.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.759
I think for me, just the emotional experience
of movie watching; the capacity of sitting

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:14.189
in the dark and being so deeply affected by
a piece of work made me want to make cinema,

00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:18.269
make media as a control freak with a god complex,
which all filmmakers are.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:22.199
We want to not just control how we feel, we
want to control how we make you feel.

00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:26.079
David Lenson, in his book "On Drugs" calls
it "The desire for stewardship of internal

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.170
life."

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.170
It's a great line.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.269
"Stewardship of internal life" means you want
to essentially pilot the experience that you're

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:33.800
having in the theater of your mind's eye.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.800
Right?

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.259
You want to be the director in the editing
room, cutting the scene, adding the music,

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:43.459
adjusting the lighting, and creating the experience
that you're having as a viewer.

00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:46.209
You're simultaneously creating and perceiving
your world at once.

00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:50.929
You're in the movie "Inception," real time
authoring of your own subjective dreamscape

00:16:50.929 --> 00:16:51.980
in real time.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.660
That's where it comes from.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.749
It's like, I love losing myself in flow, and
I'm a total control freak who wants to control

00:16:57.749 --> 00:17:01.290
the way in which he loses himself, and wants
to make sure he captures the experience of

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.309
losing himself so that he can watch it later
as a reminder that it is possible.

00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:12.760
All of it comes, again, from a desire to overcome
my own limitations, but also because the alternative,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.070
to quote David Foster-Wallace, is one of my
favorite quotes of all time, "The alternative

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.660
to that is unconsciousness."

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.800
The default setting.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800
The rat race.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.060
The constant gnawing sense of having had and
lost some infinite thing.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.290
Anybody who's ever been genuinely inspired,
anybody who's ever experienced going down

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.090
the wormhole like Jodie Foster in "Contact"
and said "Oh my god, they should've sent a

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:37.670
poet," is privy to this sensation of connecting
with something larger than yourself.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:43.350
You step aside, and you become more than what
you were, and so, who wouldn't want to return

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.350
to that.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.350
But that?

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.350
That is fleeting.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.740
That is temporary.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.970
That is ephemeral.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.060
That is rare, and often haphazard.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.000
I don't accept these terms.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.630
I didn't sign up for this.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.160
How do I stabilize ecstasis?

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.780
How do I stabilize and eternalize inspiration?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.240
Last night I sat on my laptop and looked up
some of my favorite movie scenes on YouTube,

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.790
and watched them right after the other to
get my brain into an aroused state of suggestibility

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.270
and emotion, to reconnect with feeling alive.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.540
Because, again, the default setting is not
that.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.790
That's not how we're wired.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:26.730
Tom: I want to come back to the movie thing,
because as one of your viewers, I had a really

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.050
interesting experience with what you put out,
and we'll talk about that in a second.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:35.630
But I really hope people are hearing what
you're saying, because ... I owe you an apology.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:42.410
The first time I encountered you on the internet,
I was so blown away, the only thing I could

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.690
think is that you had a magical gift.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:51.990
I wasn't thinking hard work, I wasn't thinking
practice, I was just so astonished and jealous

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:57.990
of your ability to do that, that some part
of my brain was like, "He must be born with

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.990
that."

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.190
Because the chasm between where I was and
where you were was just ... it seemed too

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.760
inhuman to ever cross, and now I know better,
and I know that it's something that you've

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.940
cultivated, and what I really want to make
sure people hear is that this is you overcoming

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.650
introversion.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.600
It's you overcoming excessive self-talk in
your own mind that would otherwise paralyze

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600
you.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.280
Because the promise that I make to people
is that if you watch this show, you're gonna

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.630
be better and perform better than if you hadn't
watched the show, right?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.690
And so, if they can see you in that context:
"Okay, this is a guy, a result of somewhere

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:36.150
I could go and where I could get," then that
hopefully really sets them free, because it

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.510
is astonishing how you've been able to leverage
flow triggers, an understanding of the brain,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:46.600
a deep understanding of the brain, science,
technology, pharmacology, all of it that you've

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.000
done to really take yourself somewhere new.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.610
Jason: Even as I've had success, I've had
a lot of moments where I created a video that

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:05.630
was beyond anything I thought I could do,
and it'd send my mind spiraling to this really

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:10.460
happy place, because now that this video exists
in the world, the rest of my life will just

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.180
springboard from that.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.750
Now that I've made this, the rest is inevitably
good.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.460
But you would think that that high would just
stay, and it hasn't.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:30.230
I've struggled with mostly anxiety from the
fact that no matter how greatly I'm able to

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:36.610
channel my creativity to create something
in the world, that something is still a temporary

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.610
thing.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.570
I make a video, I can only watch it so many
times before I'm sick of it, and there's the

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.900
desire for that next thing.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:51.370
But what will sometimes haunt my dreams, still,
is unarticulated fear.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:59.460
Just a general feeling of morose anxiety,
of just, "What if it all ends?

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.760
What does it all mean in the end?"

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:08.010
I went to see the movie "La La Land," and
I loved every second of it, but this goes

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.660
back to my view of the human condition.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:15.760
I was simultaneously mourning the film as
it ended.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:22.540
To fully and vividly live in the present is
also to be acquainted with the fact that it's

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.290
expiring as we live through it.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:32.150
If we were infinite, if we knew that we had
forever, then it wouldn't matter, because

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.500
then it'd be like, "Well, I'll watch this
again tomorrow."

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:41.990
But to know that time is running out, whether
we live 90 years or 105, every day is a day

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.710
you'll never get back.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.420
That is still a problem for me.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.880
That's how intensely I love the human experience.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.120
That's how much-
Tom: That quote that you said in Spanish,

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.680
obviously I don't know the Spanish, but it
translated, "The day is escaping me."

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680
Jason: Si.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.940
Se me escapa, me escapa el día.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.190
"Se me escapa el día."

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.482
Tom: And that is exactly how I feel, like
the day is escaping me.

00:22:05.482 --> 00:22:09.030
Jason: I can tell we relate on that together,
because that's the fire in our belly.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:14.270
We wake up agitated, and some would say, many
psychologists would say, like, "Well, you

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.000
owe your success and your work to that angst."

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Tom: Oh, for sure.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.940
Jason: "Make friends with it, because without
it, you wouldn't have achieve what you have

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940
achieved."

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.640
You know, Jamie Weal told me, he's like, "You
love your neurosis.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.050
You love your pain and your angst because
it informs your work."

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.091
In a way, it's true.

00:22:33.091 --> 00:22:38.550
It's why I've never really taken an antidepressant,
because when you read about what most people

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:44.120
who experience the intense polarity that we
do, the highs and the lows, it's like you

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.000
can get on a pill that will just numb you
out, that will just make everything "Eh."

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.100
But when I feel "Eh," it's the beginning of
"I'm not happy with this," you know?

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.030
I'd rather be crying or joyously celebrating.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.730
Tom: That's not a statement you hear everyday.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.390
No, I totally get that.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:08.920
You've talked about, with love, that in many
ways, it's the agony of knowing that it's

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.390
temporary, and that it's either a delicate
moment with that person just knowing that

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.620
they're a delicate creature and that nothing
lasts forever.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.620
Jason: Yeah.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.300
Perhaps it is that fleetingness that impregnates
such moments with such beauty.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.220
Tom: You said that we're insatiable wanting
machines.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.030
And that sort of sits at the heart of the
human condition.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.140
That, as soon as I heard that, I was like,
"That defines me."

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.040
I am an insatiable wanting machine, right?

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.490
And this is one of the reasons that I rail
against people chasing money so hard.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.400
You'll never have enough, okay?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.960
So don't even bother.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.200
The same thing that you feel about however
much you're making now, you're gonna feel

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.740
whether you've got 10, 50, 100 million dollars
in the bank.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:57.330
It literally won't matter because we're insatiable
wanting machines.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.450
Why are we insatiable wanting machines?

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.280
Is it service, is it a hindrance?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.260
Jason: It's a side effect of our wiring.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.500
We are wired to seek out novelty.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.020
Dopamine floods our system whenever we're
exposed to the new.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:20.830
Originally, that is what made us explorers,
that is what made us spread our seed or semen

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.700
widely.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:29.520
It was wired to procreate, wired for novelty,
wired for that new mate.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.030
We also have hedonic adaptation.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.290
Hedonic adaptation means that our hedonic
set point, what gives us pleasure today will

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.450
not give us pleasure tomorrow through repeated
exposure, because again, it becomes familiar.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.700
Once it's familiar, it can be dismissed.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.860
The brain is on to bigger and better things.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.480
And it's responsible for our greatest achievements
as a species, right?

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.250
Going to the moon, building the internet.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.110
We push the boundaries of novelty; we are
a novelty-creating engine.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.490
We're the cutting edge of evolution.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.020
Evolution creates novelty, right?

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.710
Live moves towards greater novelty and complexity,
that's what life is.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:05.900
It's the anti-entropic force and the universe,
is life.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:12.930
The problem is that if we're not constantly
creating, we're restless and depressed, and

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:17.170
also, that we don't get to enjoy that which
we create much either.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:23.280
So, the ride is characterized by this drive,
by this itch, with not enough time in a state

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.380
of appreciation.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:31.990
Tom: It's interesting, because I feel about
it the way that you feel about your neuroses,

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:37.640
which is that, for all its problems, there's
actually something amazing that it gives me.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.860
I'll put it in more typical terms and I'll
call it hunger.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.390
I'm fucking hungry.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.140
I wake up everyday, and I want to do something,
and I want to do something big, and I think

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.680
that there's certain things in our culture
that we've decided it's okay to say you want

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.080
to do on a grand scale, but then there's other
things that we say that it's not okay to admit

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080
that.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.320
I think the reality is, everyone can look
inside themselves, they know what they really

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.320
want.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.580
They might be embarrassed to admit it.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.280
They might think it makes them a loser.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.280
But they know.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.491
They never own it, and because they don't
own it, they can't explore it.

00:26:08.491 --> 00:26:11.350
Because they can't explore it, they're never
able to find out if there actually is a path

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.530
to doing something.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.830
You and I were talking before the camera started
rolling, and I was saying, "'Impact Theory'

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.830
is me."

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.520
If anybody wanted to know, and I used to get
asked this all the time when I was at Quest,

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.260
"What would you do if you weren't at Quest?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.770
If money were no object, what would you do?"

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.640
And I can actually say I've answered that
with, right?

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.460
The answer is "Impact Theory," and what is
"Impact Theory"?

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.400
"Impact Theory" is me answering the no-bullshit
question of "What does it take to influence

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.520
culture at the deepest level?"

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.250
And you know why I want to do it: I want to
pull people out of the Matrix.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.060
And why do I want to pull people out of the
Matrix?

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.380
Because for me, there's a neurochemical addiction
to the moment of awakening.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.120
I love seeing in somebody else where they
finally get it, that- We were talking about

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.660
"V for Vendetta," that they realized the prison
is fake, and this whole time they've been

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.890
trapped, and it's all of their own making.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:06.540
That, to me, is the fucking juice; I'm just
wired to really enjoy that moment.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.910
And then if you want to supercharge it, 10x
a thousand fold, whatever, let me realize

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.950
I was a part of it, that I helped in some
way.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.660
Jason: Well, that's your symbolic immortality,
by the way.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.260
Tom: That's a great point.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:24.480
Jason: Ernest Becker says, "There's three
ways we respond to the terror of meaninglessness

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.720
in the face of mortality."

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.920
The first one is the religious impulse, we
talked about it last time.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.160
The second one is the romantic impulse, where
you basically turn your girlfriend or boyfriend

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.020
into god, and by purging or rubbing up against
the infinite, they make you infinite.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.650
But then, he ultimately says that to live
a heroic life--he talks about heroism, cosmic

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:48.790
heroism--is to want to create something that
is beyond you, and that's what you're doing

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.090
with "Impact Theory," which I think is a beautiful
thing.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.910
Tom: But now do you want to go really deep
for a second?

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:53.910
Jason: Sure.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:59.010
Tom: I know it's all a bullshit lie that is
being told to me by my genetics to make sure

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.810
that I keep moving, and pushing forward, and
trying to help the group so that the group

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.810
survives, right?

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.090
It's somewhat irrelevant if I survive.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:13.830
But even in that, I just want myself to know
that even that is sort of a manipulation that

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.250
the brain plays on you, that I should be incentivized
to do something.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.470
Oh, but it's positive, Jason, therefore it's
okay.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.820
It's the same mechanisms at work, right?

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.460
But being aware of it, I think, puts you in
the driver's seat, which I find pretty interesting.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.040
Jason: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.660
Because you've also decided consciousness
is mediated by chemistry, and you have figured

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.280
out the knobs-and-levers approach.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.980
"What do I need to do in my life to make my
subjective experience really enthralling,

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.850
because nature rewards me for doing what I'm
meant to do in this world."

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:52.110
If destiny is real, destiny is just you being
wired to do what you're meant to do, chemically,

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:57.000
biologically, genetically, and finding a way
to marry that to your subjective experience.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.220
Follow your bliss and doors will open for
you where there were no doors.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.600
Maybe Joseph Campbell was hinting at that.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.810
Where nature marries subjective experience.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.680
Where genetic predisposition and determinism
marries the feeling of volition, and agency,

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.270
and free will that a creative mind living
its bliss feels.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.270
Maybe that's where they meet.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.340
Tom: I think you're really on to something
there.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:23.130
One of the opening lines of "The Power of
Myth" is, at least the interview series, where

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:29.470
Bill Moyers asks him, "What is it about this
that makes you think that everybody should

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.470
pay attention to it?"

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.470
Meaning mythology.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.860
He said, "I don't think everybody should pay
attention to it just because somebody says

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.860
it's important."

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.370
He said, "I think, if properly introduced
to this subject, that it will catch you."

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.860
And he said, "You should only do what catches
you."

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.050
Putting it in the language that we were just
talking, it's when you align that thing that

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:52.560
you're wired to do, whatever that chemical
result, and then you follow it.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.560
It's caught you.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.110
You're not doing it out of obligation, and
that's something so many people are driven

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.110
by, obligation, right?

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.580
"I should do this, I should do that."

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.510
Instead of saying, "What catches me?

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.880
What pulls me through?"

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.910
Jason: Answer the call, yeah.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:11.440
It's interesting, because any creative person,
at some point or another, has trusted the

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.230
process, has figured out how certain environments
can catalyze creativity, has figured out what

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:25.570
their triggers for flow are, whatever woo-woo
things fall into place that lead to the magic

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.110
of creativity.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.520
I still believe in science, so I don't want
to surrender to magical thinking, but at the

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.200
end of the day, creativity is a form of magic.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.540
Maybe there can be an explanation, but for
somebody who has an aversion to the concept

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:52.460
of faith, or believing in magic, really, I
still live as if I believe in magic, and partake

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.800
in the creative process.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:01.620
I'm aware of the contradictions, but one of
the hallmarks of all mystical, creative epiphanies,

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:07.640
is a sense of paradoxicality so that you can
hold multiple truths in mind at once.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:13.580
Seemingly contradictory ideas are reconciled
in that state of no-mind and ecstasy.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.220
Tom: It's interesting that you say that.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.520
I used to talk a lot about this, I don't know
why it hasn't been on my mind lately, but

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.250
I really believe that one of the abilities
you must cultivate if you want to be successful

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:29.380
is the ability to hold two competing ideas
in your head at the same time.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.340
Here I have these two ideas; they compete
with each other, and I need to know when to

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.590
look at this one, and really pay attention
to it, and let my behavior be driven by this,

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:42.070
and when to look at this completely contradictory
thing and know when to lean on this one.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.320
It's fucking fascinating.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.950
Jason: When we leverage that, though, that
seems to serve us.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:47.950
Right?

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.950
Tom: No question.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:53.450
And maybe that points to the ... there is
no objective reality.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.910
It's so hard to make things absolute.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:00.560
I have a belief that human potential is nearly
limitless.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.490
Now, why do I throw in "Nearly" limitless?

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.490
I do it partly to, because I'm holding competing
ideas in my head.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.230
On the one hand, I believe human potential
is completely limitless, and then on the other

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:16.160
hand, I know if I step off the roof I'm gonna
fall and break something.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.120
And how you reconcile those two things, it's
like-

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.860
Jason: Well, for me, that causes tremendous
anxiety.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.930
Tom: Really?

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.300
Jason: Because I figure, as long as we're
young and healthy, and we take care of our

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:34.120
physical hardware--we get enough sleep, we
exercise, we eat well--we can more or less

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.390
take our physiology for granted.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:46.920
Thankfully, I'm very healthy, but I've experienced
health scares in my life, mostly self-created.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.510
Something happened and then I assumed it was
the worst.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:57.630
But I can tell you that in the midst of a
panic attack, of a true ontological terror,

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:02.360
it doesn't matter if you think you're dying
or if you think you're going crazy, it's the

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.680
same thing.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.880
You're losing your grip.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.500
You're losing your grip, even on your own
stabilized identity, and I'm working on some

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.690
videos on the subject.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:17.150
I think mental health, depression and anxiety
in this country, are chronic.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.690
In the world, it's one of the most diagnosed
illnesses now, in the world.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:21.940
More than physical illnesses.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.440
Like, great, we have science, we have vaccines,
people living longer, healthier, but they're

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.950
fucking depressed and anxious.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.430
We have not-good systems, I think, to fill
our holes.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.140
Tom: It's so interesting.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:40.090
One of the driving forces behind founding
the company was- Because people were like,

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:45.200
"Wait, why are changing your mission from
Quest, like this whole new thing?"

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.740
And to me it's not a different mission.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.210
At Quest, what we were trying to do is wellness,
right?

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.740
So now you can get hyper-focused and and say,
"What's the tactic we're using?"

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.210
And the tactic there was to end metabolic
disease.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.770
But at the end of the day, for me, and I'm
speaking for myself, not for my partners who

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.990
were focused on very different things, but
for me, it was ... there were people in my

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.349
life that I loved, and they were very unhappy.

00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:10.129
Profoundly unhappy.

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:13.620
Playing the no-bullshit, what-would-it-take
game, I knew the answer was, you know, my

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.639
sister was clinically depressed.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:20.340
To help her, she had to get in better shape,
because she was in this vicious cycle of food;

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.419
she had a negative self body image, the only
thing that gave her comfort was food, and

00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:27.960
that gave her a more negative body image and
made her feel like she had no willpower and

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.339
all that, and so she just, super destructive.

00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:33.899
So, by giving her food that she could choose
based on taste, and happened to be good for

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:35.319
her, it got her going in the opposite direction.

00:34:35.319 --> 00:34:38.889
She started to feel better, look better, she
was making one simple choice: eat this bar

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.549
instead of a bag of M&amp;M's or whatever.

00:34:41.549 --> 00:34:44.619
So it got her going, helped build confidence,
all that.

00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:46.069
It was really, really incredible.

00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:47.339
But it was about wellness.

00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:51.389
It was about wanting to see my sister happy,
right?

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.220
The other side of the coin was always mental
happiness.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.880
I believe that we're living through two pandemics
right now: pandemic one is the pandemic of

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.880
the body.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.079
It's very easy to see, people are morbidly
obese, super visible.

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:04.119
When somebody dies of diabetes, it's crazy.

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.220
They're literally burning alive from the inside
out.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.050
It starts at the extremities, they start cutting
off toes, then foot, leg, and then you're

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.769
gone.

00:35:12.769 --> 00:35:18.170
It's so visible, whereas mental illness, on
the other hand, the pandemic of the mind,

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.170
it's invisible.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.170
Jason: Agreed.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.820
There's Sam Harris, who's also brilliant and
I've consulted with on this topic, says, "Why

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.390
are we so concerned with the story?"

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:32.720
Look, the brain is wired to tell stories,
so when you're physically uncomfortable, it

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.480
will tell a story.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.440
That discomfort will inform the story, and
give it a negative tinge.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.930
Sometimes I feel anxious, and what I realize
is I just have to pee, but I was creating

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.049
this whole story.

00:35:45.049 --> 00:35:48.020
And one of the things he said is that you
think of anxiety as just a peculiar sensation,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.730
like when you have an itch.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:54.160
When you have an itch, you scratch it if you
can, and if you can't, you just let the sensation

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.599
pass.

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:58.579
And he says, "Try to do the same thing when
you're feeling anxious."

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:00.150
Mindfulness meditators talk about that too.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.150
"Okay, just let it come in.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.150
Don't resist it.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:08.640
If you can just feel it, breathe through it,"
and if you don't allow it to hijack you, it

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.849
will just pass like just another sensation.

00:36:11.849 --> 00:36:13.410
Tom: That's really interesting.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.569
I'll give you one of my anxiety triggers.

00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:16.569
Jason: Yep.

00:36:16.569 --> 00:36:18.339
Tom: Being cold.

00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:21.410
Anybody that knows me knows I'm freaky about
being cold.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.380
I do not like to be cold.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.200
The reason I don't like to be cold is the
physiological response to cold is exactly

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.280
the same, that I get, anyway, when I'm anxious.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280
Jason: Well, there you go.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.759
Tom: I feel slightly shivery, so if I'm super
warm but anxious, I'll feel that same sense

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:35.880
of being shivery.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.049
So, getting cold makes me feel like I'm really
anxious about something.

00:36:39.049 --> 00:36:41.220
So I'm like, "The fuck?"

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.480
But that analogy is very helpful, I will begin
employing it immediately.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480
Jason: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.880
I mean, it seems to work for me.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.049
At least, definitely for exercise.

00:36:49.049 --> 00:36:55.150
Tom: You've been involved with the XPRIZE,
I've been heavily involved in the XPRIZE,

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.060
consider myself sort of a junior futurist,
if you will.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:05.010
I am very interested to ask you a question
which ... in fact, I'll ask now and then I'm

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:09.490
gonna give you a second to think about, because
your gonna resist answering this but I really

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:10.829
want you to take a shot.

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:11.829
Jason: Okay.

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:15.069
Tom: Peer inside the singularity.

00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:16.069
What's in there?

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:17.410
We'll both do it, I won't leave you hanging.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.410
They're gonna be absurd.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.640
The whole point of the singularity is that
you can't see beyond it, so why is he asking

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.329
us to do that?

00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:26.099
Jason: I think ... and I've thought about
this a lot-

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:29.440
Tom: So you don't even need a second, let's
go.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.819
Jason: I think that to quantify-
Tom: First tell people what the singularity

00:37:33.819 --> 00:37:34.819
is.

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:35.819
Jason: All right.

00:37:35.819 --> 00:37:40.799
So, the singularity, for those who don't know,
in Silicon Valley vernacular, is kind of like

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:44.720
the rapture of the nerds.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.259
It's engineered Nirvana, it's heaven.

00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:53.599
It's human beings transcending mortality,
biology, even our cognition as it exists today

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:56.589
and phase change.

00:37:56.589 --> 00:38:01.769
It's a metaphor borrowed from physics to describe
what happens when you go through a black hole.

00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:07.940
The upcoming singularity, the one in which
humans transcend biology, aside from giving

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:14.170
us indefinite lifespans, potentially migrating
beyond biology or radically extending our

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.710
biological hardware, first of all we'll get
rid of the concept of death, and might eventually

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.200
rid us of the concept of time.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.859
I liken it to the end of "Vanilla Sky" where
they sell Tom Cruise's character the idea

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:29.329
of the life extension lucid dream.

00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:36.310
You'll live it in the perpetual present where
everything just improves, like a reality rendered

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.720
at the speed of thought.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:44.450
What that looks like will be shaped by whatever
that particular mind dreams up.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:50.529
I know that for me, it's probably gonna look
a lot like a collage of all my favorite movies.

00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:57.290
It'll be an ageless present in which my favorite
scenes from my favorite movies unfold around

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.760
me forever.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.760
That would be my singularity.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.760
Utopia beyond time.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.760
Tom: All right.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.569
I so badly want to keep going down that rabbit
hole, but I'll reel us back in for a second

00:39:06.569 --> 00:39:11.890
and say, as somebody who watches your Facebook,
it was really, really fascinating what you

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.519
were doing, showing clips from movies that
really moved you.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:18.579
You want to talk about inviting someone inside
your mind, it was ... Because each moment

00:39:18.579 --> 00:39:21.809
was emotional, I was feeling what you were
feeling.

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:22.809
Jason: Exactly.

00:39:22.809 --> 00:39:28.089
Tom: And so, to see what you saw as beautiful
or poignant was so cool.

00:39:28.089 --> 00:39:31.869
It was like the ultimate card to send to somebody.

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:37.059
In fact, it makes me want to do this for my
wife, just to be like, "Here are seven moments"-

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:38.059
Jason: "This is me."

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:39.059
Tom: Yeah!

00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:40.059
Fuck!

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:41.059
"This is me!"

00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:42.059
Fuck, dude.

00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:44.759
And that was exactly how it felt watching
your stuff.

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:48.700
This is- You're either gonna get it or you're
gonna be like, "What?"

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.230
So, my wife knows the story.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:57.460
I was on a business trip, and we were out,
there was four of us, and because I'm so secure

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:04.390
in my relationship with my wife, it was fun
to be around other people who were doing the

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.970
courtship ritual, but to be on the outside
of that.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.720
But because they were all doing it, it was
like a heightened state, and I had this sweatshirt

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.000
on and I needed to take it off, and I turned
to the woman next to me.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.680
I said, "This is gonna be oddly intimate,
but will you please hold the bottom of my

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.180
shirt for me so I can take my top shirt off
without it coming off.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.230
And so she reached over and did it, and I
took my shirt off, and she was like, "That

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.680
really was strangely intimate."

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.259
And I thought, "Wow, we've shared" ... It's
such a small moment, right?

00:40:29.259 --> 00:40:36.170
But it's so real, and so tangible, that it
really did have this intimacy about it.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:42.309
Some of the clips that you put were small
like that, and so they this really real intimacy

00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:47.329
where I felt like ... I fucking just stepped
into your mind a bit.

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:49.670
It was so fucking interesting.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:50.670
Thank you for that.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.670
I will be doing that for my wife.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:52.670
Jason: You're welcome, man.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.660
Tom: Talk to me about where do you want to
see cinema go.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.460
Jason: It's interesting.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:07.520
I, in trying to be as ambitious creatively,
but also pragmatic, as my clips have resonated,

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.380
it's created an interest in me for other projects
and opportunities, for other people's agendas,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:18.359
so I get invited quite a bit to come inspire
audiences at big corporate key-notes for IBM,

00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:21.480
and Intel, and Cisco, and that's great.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.619
I'm lucky that I get to do that, and share
my mind with these people, and talk about

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:27.299
the singularity and the future.

00:41:27.299 --> 00:41:28.299
It's all great.

00:41:28.299 --> 00:41:30.720
The new show with "Origins" is great.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.420
National Geographic, major platform, I hope
it does extraordinarily well.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:44.910
I would also like to focus and put more resources
into doing special edition video content,

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:48.810
and what I mean by that is I'm an artist,
not an art factory.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:54.029
Sometimes having to constantly be pushing
out content doesn't allow me to labor lovingly

00:41:54.029 --> 00:41:56.140
on making a video perfect.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:02.450
So, I guess it's figuring out a system that
financially makes sense for me to do that.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:07.350
You always want to do your thing, and you're
not sure if your thing has mass-market appeal.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:12.299
It's like, "Oh, Facebook is getting more crowded,
and the algorithms are making it harder for

00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:15.519
people to, even your own fans to see your
content."

00:42:15.519 --> 00:42:18.549
So it's like, "Well, what does one do?"

00:42:18.549 --> 00:42:22.700
Tom: It's interesting, because anybody out
there who wants to make content, watch his

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.630
content, and one thing you're gonna see is
how much he has sort of three layers of content.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:35.640
Layer one is completely unguarded and intimate,
and it's fun to watch you dip in and out of

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.839
what people think is Jason Silva, right?

00:42:38.839 --> 00:42:42.910
I feel like I'm just one of your boys, and
we're hanging, and we're eating bitterballens,

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.440
and having a chat about the view, and all
of that.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:51.779
And then there's the art machine, where your
shots have all been coming out every week

00:42:51.779 --> 00:42:54.990
whether want it to or not, and it's beautiful
to watch you get into that state and really

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.990
create this stuff.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.900
And then there's this new content that you're
about to put out, which we just looked at,

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.630
and it is artful.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.940
Jason: Thank you.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.290
Tom: It's artful on every level.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:09.950
To me, as a fellow content creator, that's
the new game, right?

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.470
That's the new paradigm that everybody is
playing.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.680
What are the layers to your creation?

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.430
Because you can't ... not everything that
we do can be this.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.430
Right?

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.270
That's the fastest way to go broke.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:25.039
But the audience is a certain percentage of
people around the world, right?

00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:28.789
They want what we're doing, they want more,
they want different ways to engage in it,

00:43:28.789 --> 00:43:34.890
and the fact that you're delivering on that
in all these Inception-like layers to your

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.799
personality is pretty intriguing.

00:43:36.799 --> 00:43:38.190
Jason: Thanks, bro.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.300
We'll have to keep it going.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.750
Tom: Yeah, no question.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.210
Jason: Hopefully I can.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.680
Tom: No, you will, you will, man.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.470
And that goes back to what I was saying, that
people see you in the context of somebody

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:55.779
who gave birth to something before it was
a thing.

00:43:55.779 --> 00:43:58.500
To be Jason Silva now is almost a verb.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.119
It's like, other people trying to do what
you do, getting in your flow states, create

00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:03.970
the kind of things your creating.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.472
It's really interesting, and it's beautiful
to watch you push, and going back to "We are

00:44:07.472 --> 00:44:11.920
insatiable wanting machines," I'm glad, as
somebody who loves your content, I'm glad

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920
that you're not satisfied.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.170
All right, one last question.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:15.170
Jason: Sure.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:20.400
Tom: What's the impact that you want to have
on the world.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:33.670
Jason: It certainly is life-affirming and
elating when you come across somebody who

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:42.549
has resonated with your content, because what
it feels like is the opposite of fear.

00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:49.030
You feel your power to do good, and that's
awesome.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.680
Not just feeling your power, right?

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.109
This is not like "I am powerful!"

00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:59.630
Feeling your power to do good feels really
good, because it's like, "Oh, so, I guess

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:07.170
I can do something about my feeling of impotence
in the face of where the world is going with

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:12.150
politics," or in the face of whatever it is
that gets you down.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:18.119
But that you can do good, so you can respond
to that malaise.

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:23.710
You can respond to the doom and gloom.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:30.609
It's either that, or cower away and die.

00:45:30.609 --> 00:45:36.619
I think I want something similar to what you
probably want, as well.

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:40.349
Positively impact people.

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:49.589
To be net good, that what we do in the world
raises the stage for others as well.

00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:50.589
That would be the goal.

00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:51.589
Tom: I love that.

00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:53.210
Where can these guys find you online?

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.640
Jason: Facebook is great.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.710
Facebook.com/JasonLSilva, or just look up
my Facebook page, which is verified.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.619
It's easy to find.

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:05.150
Instagram, @jasonlsilva.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:06.680
Twitter, @jasonsilva.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.690
I mean, I'm on all the social media platforms.

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.930
A quick Google search, they should be able
to find it.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:17.720
But definitely, for the videos, Facebook is
where I've seen the most growth, so I appreciate

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.990
when people come in there, and engage, and
share.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:23.839
Tom: And don't forget the new show, which
I'm super hyped about.

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:24.839
"Origins."

00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:25.839
Jason: Yes.

00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:32.249
"Origins: The Journey of Humankind" is going
to chronicle the story of humanity through

00:46:32.249 --> 00:46:37.900
a modern lens, so we start with today, and
then we trace back the origins of things like

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.589
language, fire, transportation, war.

00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:47.509
We trace these things to their origins, to
the moments in which humanity was witnessing

00:46:47.509 --> 00:46:52.430
the next big thing that transformed humans
into who we became.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.289
It's gonna be really good.

00:46:55.289 --> 00:46:56.289
National Geographic Channel.

00:46:56.289 --> 00:46:57.289
Tom: Nice.

00:46:57.289 --> 00:46:58.289
I'm super excited, man.

00:46:58.289 --> 00:46:59.681
Thank you so much for coming on the show.

00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:00.681
Jason: Thanks for having me, bro.

00:47:00.681 --> 00:47:01.681
Tom: Always a pleasure.

00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:02.681
Jason: What a pleasure.

00:47:02.681 --> 00:47:03.681
Thank you, man.

00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:04.681
Tom: All right, guys.

00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:08.890
I hope that you were paying attention to the
links he was giving you to follow him socially,

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.130
because I'm telling you, this guy is unbelievable.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:17.319
The way that he's able to synthesize ideas
and DJ them, it's one of the most accurate

00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:22.000
things you're ever gonna hear people say about
him is he is a DJ of ideas, and I think that

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
is so true.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.839
The way that he is able to combine novel ideas
to literally collapse your reality tunnel,

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:34.700
as he says, and get you de-centered and seeing
the world in a totally new way.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:40.410
It is absolutely astonishing, and from the
smallest moments that he's able to capture,

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:45.019
and stretch out, and really make you feel
something, to the grand moments, the way that

00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:52.999
he talks about the cosmos and can really invite
you into the most complicated and seemingly

00:47:52.999 --> 00:47:58.229
unreachable ideas that we have at the deepest
levels of neuroscience, cosmology, all of

00:47:58.229 --> 00:48:01.380
it, but he makes it accessible, and he does
it by making it emotional.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.950
He's gonna make it tangible, he's gonna make
you feel something.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:12.270
He is the great translator, and he is able
to take the most audacious ideas, and make

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:16.970
you feel like you can make them your own,
and go out and do something with them.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.609
He is an artist.

00:48:18.609 --> 00:48:20.099
He is a poet.

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:23.349
And he is a scientist, even though he would
never use that word.

00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:28.320
But it is beautiful, the dichotomy that he
represents, and the way that he's able to

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.320
bring it all together.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.670
There is, in my opinion, no human being that
is anything like Jason Silva, so go check

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:35.670
him out.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.180
Jason, thank you so much, man.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.339
Jason: Thank you so much, bro.

00:48:39.339 --> 00:48:40.339
Wow, what an honor.

00:48:40.339 --> 00:48:41.339
Tom: Absolutely.

00:48:41.339 --> 00:48:42.420
Guys, please give it up for Jason Silva.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.420
Jason: Wow.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.579
Tom: That was awesome, dude.

00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:53.839
