00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:12.870 align:start position:0%
lost less than 70 people I mean that's
 

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:18.380 align:start position:0%
lost less than 70 people I mean that's
that<00:29:13.200><c> is</c><00:29:13.910><c> bonkers</c><00:29:14.940><c> so</c><00:29:15.720><c> really</c><00:29:16.710><c> speaks</c><00:29:17.550><c> to</c><00:29:17.730><c> the</c>

that is bonkers so really speaks to the
 

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
that is bonkers so really speaks to the
