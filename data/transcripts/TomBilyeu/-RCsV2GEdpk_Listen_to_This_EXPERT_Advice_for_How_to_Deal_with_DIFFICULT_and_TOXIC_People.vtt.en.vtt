was kind of thinking i could have said
 

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.670 align:start position:0%
was kind of thinking i could have said
something<00:10:50.160><c> along</c><00:10:50.480><c> the</c><00:10:50.640><c> lines</c><00:10:50.959><c> of</c><00:10:51.360><c> well</c><00:10:51.600><c> you</c>

we've got the michael jordan flu game
 

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
we've got the michael jordan flu game
okay<00:20:36.159><c> which</c><00:20:36.400><c> is</c><00:20:36.480><c> probably</c><00:20:36.799><c> my</c><00:20:37.039><c> most</c>

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay which is probably my most
 

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.390 align:start position:0%
okay which is probably my most
meaningful<00:20:38.080><c> piece</c><00:20:38.400><c> of</c><00:20:38.640><c> art</c><00:20:39.039><c> okay</c><00:20:39.679><c> uh</c><00:20:40.000><c> it's</c><00:20:40.240><c> all</c>

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
meaningful piece of art okay uh it's all
 

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
meaningful piece of art okay uh it's all
art<00:20:40.799><c> so</c><00:20:40.960><c> i</c><00:20:41.039><c> guess</c><00:20:41.200><c> we'll</c><00:20:41.360><c> start</c><00:20:41.520><c> with</c><00:20:41.600><c> that</c>

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
art so i guess we'll start with that
 

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
art so i guess we'll start with that
okay<00:20:42.080><c> and</c><00:20:42.240><c> then</c>

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.149 align:start position:0%
okay and then
mostly<00:20:43.600><c> movies</c><00:20:44.559><c> so</c><00:20:44.880><c> matrix</c><00:20:45.520><c> has</c><00:20:45.760><c> like</c><00:20:45.919><c> three</c>

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
mostly movies so matrix has like three
 

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
mostly movies so matrix has like three
or<00:20:46.320><c> four</c><00:20:46.720><c> appearances</c><00:20:47.520><c> in</c><00:20:47.679><c> the</c><00:20:47.760><c> house</c>

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
or four appearances in the house
um<00:20:49.360><c> and</c><00:20:49.600><c> then</c><00:20:50.080><c> that's</c><00:20:50.400><c> pretty</c><00:20:50.559><c> much</c><00:20:50.799><c> it</c><00:20:51.360><c> so</c>

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and then that's pretty much it so
 

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
um and then that's pretty much it so
what<00:20:51.760><c> they</c><00:20:52.080><c> say</c><00:20:52.320><c> is</c><00:20:52.640><c> this</c><00:20:52.799><c> is</c><00:20:52.960><c> a</c><00:20:53.039><c> research</c>

reaction to this stimulus actually moves
 

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
reaction to this stimulus actually moves

00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
so step one is having that clear goal
 

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.909 align:start position:0%
