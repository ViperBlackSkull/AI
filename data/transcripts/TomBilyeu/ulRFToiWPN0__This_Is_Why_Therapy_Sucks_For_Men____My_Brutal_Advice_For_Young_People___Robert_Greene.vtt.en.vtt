fulfillment how would that be a plus b
yeah<00:00:08.719><c> kind</c><00:00:08.880><c> of</c><00:00:09.240><c> so</c><00:00:09.519><c> here</c><00:00:09.960><c> I</c><00:00:10.160><c> think</c><00:00:10.480><c> that</c><00:00:10.719><c> so</c><00:00:10.920><c> I</c>

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah kind of so here I think that so I
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.509 align:start position:0%
yeah kind of so here I think that so I
agree<00:00:11.320><c> with</c><00:00:11.440><c> you</c><00:00:11.559><c> so</c><00:00:11.799><c> violently</c><00:00:12.240><c> I</c><00:00:12.320><c> want</c><00:00:12.400><c> to</c>

agree with you so violently I want to
bite<00:00:12.759><c> through</c><00:00:12.920><c> the</c><00:00:13.400><c> table</c><00:00:14.400><c> uh</c><00:00:15.240><c> so</c><00:00:15.559><c> I</c><00:00:16.320><c> might</c><00:00:16.480><c> not</c>

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
bite through the table uh so I might not
 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.990 align:start position:0%
bite through the table uh so I might not
be<00:00:17.160><c> the</c><00:00:17.279><c> best</c><00:00:17.480><c> use</c><00:00:17.680><c> of</c><00:00:17.800><c> my</c><00:00:18.000><c> teeth</c><00:00:19.000><c> uh</c><00:00:19.439><c> so</c><00:00:19.720><c> I</c><00:00:19.840><c> have</c>

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
be the best use of my teeth uh so I have
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
be the best use of my teeth uh so I have
a<00:00:20.320><c> rough</c><00:00:20.680><c> formula</c><00:00:21.359><c> of</c><00:00:21.560><c> what</c><00:00:21.760><c> I</c><00:00:22.039><c> think</c><00:00:22.400><c> leads</c><00:00:22.720><c> to</c>

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
a rough formula of what I think leads to
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.310 align:start position:0%
a rough formula of what I think leads to
fulfillment<00:00:23.439><c> I</c><00:00:23.519><c> think</c><00:00:23.680><c> about</c><00:00:23.840><c> this</c><00:00:24.000><c> a</c><00:00:24.080><c> lot</c><00:00:24.240><c> so</c>

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
fulfillment I think about this a lot so
 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.310 align:start position:0%
fulfillment I think about this a lot so
I'm<00:00:24.400><c> always</c><00:00:24.560><c> looking</c><00:00:24.760><c> for</c><00:00:24.880><c> somebody</c><00:00:25.160><c> that</c><00:00:25.240><c> can</c>

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm always looking for somebody that can
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
I'm always looking for somebody that can
help<00:00:25.480><c> me</c><00:00:25.640><c> refine</c><00:00:26.119><c> but</c><00:00:26.199><c> I</c><00:00:26.279><c> think</c><00:00:26.359><c> it</c><00:00:26.480><c> goes</c><00:00:26.720><c> like</c>

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
help me refine but I think it goes like
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.470 align:start position:0%
help me refine but I think it goes like
this<00:00:27.439><c> it</c><00:00:27.640><c> has</c><00:00:27.760><c> to</c><00:00:27.920><c> be</c><00:00:28.119><c> hard</c><00:00:29.039><c> and</c><00:00:29.160><c> there's</c>

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
this it has to be hard and there's
 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.070 align:start position:0%
this it has to be hard and there's
reasons<00:00:30.000><c> for</c><00:00:30.160><c> this</c><00:00:30.279><c> from</c><00:00:30.400><c> an</c><00:00:30.519><c> evolutionary</c>

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
reasons for this from an evolutionary
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.310 align:start position:0%
reasons for this from an evolutionary
standpoint<00:00:31.519><c> but</c><00:00:31.640><c> it</c><00:00:31.759><c> has</c><00:00:31.880><c> to</c><00:00:32.000><c> be</c><00:00:32.200><c> hard</c><00:00:33.079><c> it</c><00:00:33.200><c> has</c>

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.030 align:start position:0%
