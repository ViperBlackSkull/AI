00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
referring to scalability since that is
 

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:45.190 align:start position:0%
referring to scalability since that is
uh<00:24:43.640><c> the</c><00:24:44.000><c> the</c><00:24:44.120><c> thing</c><00:24:44.240><c> that</c><00:24:44.399><c> really</c><00:24:44.559><c> rings</c><00:24:44.840><c> in</c><00:24:45.000><c> my</c>

00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
mind um and I think that it will answer
 

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:48.310 align:start position:0%
mind um and I think that it will answer
that<00:24:47.080><c> question</c><00:24:47.360><c> I</c><00:24:47.440><c> think</c><00:24:47.559><c> you</c><00:24:47.640><c> will</c><00:24:47.760><c> see</c><00:24:48.120><c> very</c>

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
that question I think you will see very
 

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.029 align:start position:0%
that question I think you will see very
very<00:24:48.520><c> quickly</c><00:24:48.960><c> that</c><00:24:49.120><c> that</c><00:24:49.200><c> is</c><00:24:49.360><c> not</c><00:24:49.520><c> a</c><00:24:49.640><c> scalable</c>

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
very quickly that that is not a scalable
 

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:51.789 align:start position:0%
very quickly that that is not a scalable
Endeavor<00:24:50.440><c> without</c><00:24:50.640><c> a</c><00:24:50.880><c> massive</c><00:24:51.320><c> amount</c><00:24:51.520><c> of</c>

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
for example is it because the content
 

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.789 align:start position:0%
for example is it because the content
isn't<00:25:25.960><c> good</c><00:25:26.240><c> because</c><00:25:26.440><c> we</c><00:25:26.600><c> did</c><00:25:26.720><c> it</c><00:25:26.919><c> ourselves</c>

00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
isn't good because we did it ourselves
 

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:30.070 align:start position:0%

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
because the idea itself isn't there I
 

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
because the idea itself isn't there I
see<00:25:30.760><c> um</c><00:25:31.000><c> so</c><00:25:31.720><c> he's</c><00:25:31.960><c> saying</c><00:25:32.279><c> will</c><00:25:32.520><c> we</c><00:25:32.799><c> get</c><00:25:33.000><c> the</c>

Essence and putting it out there um
 

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.110 align:start position:0%
Essence and putting it out there um
obviously<00:32:36.159><c> there's</c><00:32:36.360><c> a</c><00:32:36.440><c> lot</c><00:32:36.559><c> of</c><00:32:36.639><c> people</c><00:32:36.840><c> doing</c>

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot of people doing
 

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.149 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot of people doing
that<00:32:37.240><c> so</c><00:32:37.360><c> I</c><00:32:37.440><c> don't</c><00:32:37.559><c> think</c><00:32:37.679><c> there's</c><00:32:37.919><c> anything</c>

00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
that so I don't think there's anything
 

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:40.950 align:start position:0%
that so I don't think there's anything

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
to patent there um and I can't imagine
 

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.870 align:start position:0%
to patent there um and I can't imagine
that<00:32:41.200><c> simply</c><00:32:41.679><c> turning</c><00:32:42.000><c> it</c><00:32:42.120><c> into</c><00:32:42.320><c> a</c><00:32:42.480><c> recording</c>

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
that simply turning it into a recording
 

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.789 align:start position:0%
that simply turning it into a recording
is<00:32:43.080><c> going</c><00:32:43.200><c> to</c><00:32:43.279><c> give</c><00:32:43.399><c> you</c><00:32:43.519><c> something</c>

at Quest we decided not to go down the

at Quest we decided not to go down the

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's all process driven uh you have to
 

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.470 align:start position:0%
it's all process driven uh you have to
be<00:32:55.559><c> doing</c><00:32:56.159><c> something</c><00:32:56.679><c> in</c><00:32:56.799><c> a</c><00:32:57.080><c> very</c><00:32:57.320><c> unique</c><00:32:57.760><c> way</c>

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
probably patent um but then you may be

Simon sck went viral you could just
literally<00:34:16.200><c> see</c><00:34:16.480><c> them</c><00:34:17.000><c> opening</c><00:34:17.359><c> up</c><00:34:17.760><c> the</c><00:34:18.320><c> um</c><00:34:18.520><c> the</c>

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
literally see them opening up the um the
 

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.829 align:start position:0%
literally see them opening up the um the
throttle<00:34:19.240><c> there</c><00:34:19.560><c> and</c><00:34:19.679><c> it</c><00:34:19.879><c> just</c><00:34:20.440><c> it</c><00:34:20.560><c> was</c><00:34:20.919><c> crazy</c>

00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
throttle there and it just it was crazy
 

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:24.190 align:start position:0%
throttle there and it just it was crazy
uh<00:34:21.960><c> but</c><00:34:22.119><c> that's</c><00:34:22.399><c> them</c><00:34:22.839><c> algorithmically</c><00:34:23.839><c> doing</c>

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh but that's them algorithmically doing
 

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.550 align:start position:0%
uh but that's them algorithmically doing
that<00:34:24.760><c> um</c><00:34:25.119><c> so</c><00:34:26.119><c> yeah</c><00:34:26.280><c> I</c><00:34:26.399><c> think</c><00:34:26.599><c> that's</c><00:34:27.240><c> um</c><00:34:27.399><c> that's</c>

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
that um so yeah I think that's um that's
 

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.790 align:start position:0%
that um so yeah I think that's um that's
really<00:34:27.760><c> where</c><00:34:27.879><c> the</c><00:34:28.000><c> juice</c><00:34:28.359><c> is</c><00:34:29.240><c> um</c><00:34:29.399><c> how</c><00:34:29.520><c> do</c><00:34:29.639><c> you</c>

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
really where the juice is um how do you
 

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.510 align:start position:0%
really where the juice is um how do you
prepare<00:34:30.079><c> for</c><00:34:30.399><c> rapid</c><00:34:30.760><c> growth</c><00:34:31.679><c> H</c><00:34:32.079><c> I</c><00:34:32.159><c> would</c><00:34:32.280><c> say</c>

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
prepare for rapid growth H I would say
 

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.349 align:start position:0%
prepare for rapid growth H I would say
right<00:34:32.639><c> now</c><00:34:32.839><c> that's</c><00:34:33.159><c> really</c><00:34:33.560><c> not</c><00:34:33.919><c> the</c><00:34:34.159><c> thing</c>

00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
right now that's really not the thing
