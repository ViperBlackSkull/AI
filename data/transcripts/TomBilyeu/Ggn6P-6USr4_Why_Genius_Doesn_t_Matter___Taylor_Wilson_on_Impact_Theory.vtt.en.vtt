wanted<00:03:07.590><c> to</c><00:03:07.740><c> do</c><00:03:07.890><c> something</c><00:03:08.250><c> I</c><00:03:08.340><c> was</c><00:03:08.460><c> gonna</c><00:03:08.550><c> do</c><00:03:08.820><c> it</c>

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 align:start position:0%
wanted to do something I was gonna do it
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.130 align:start position:0%
wanted to do something I was gonna do it
and<00:03:09.590><c> so</c><00:03:10.590><c> I</c><00:03:10.620><c> I</c><00:03:11.090><c> mean</c><00:03:12.090><c> I</c><00:03:12.120><c> got</c><00:03:12.300><c> nuclear</c><00:03:12.810><c> science</c>

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
and so I I mean I got nuclear science
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870 align:start position:0%
and so I I mean I got nuclear science
when<00:03:13.230><c> I</c><00:03:13.320><c> was</c><00:03:13.410><c> 10</c><00:03:13.590><c> years</c><00:03:13.620><c> old</c><00:03:13.920><c> and</c><00:03:14.250><c> decided</c><00:03:14.850><c> that</c>

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
when I was 10 years old and decided that
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 align:start position:0%
when I was 10 years old and decided that
there<00:03:15.660><c> had</c><00:03:15.840><c> to</c><00:03:15.870><c> be</c><00:03:15.990><c> a</c><00:03:16.050><c> way</c><00:03:16.290><c> for</c><00:03:16.590><c> me</c><00:03:16.680><c> to</c><00:03:16.710><c> kind</c><00:03:16.950><c> of</c>

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
there had to be a way for me to kind of
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.460 align:start position:0%
there had to be a way for me to kind of
access<00:03:17.400><c> those</c><00:03:17.580><c> nuclear</c><00:03:18.000><c> reactions</c><00:03:18.120><c> and</c><00:03:18.750><c> the</c>

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 align:start position:0%
access those nuclear reactions and the
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.110 align:start position:0%
access those nuclear reactions and the
easiest<00:03:19.890><c> way</c><00:03:20.100><c> to</c><00:03:20.130><c> do</c><00:03:20.340><c> that</c><00:03:20.490><c> seemed</c><00:03:20.760><c> to</c><00:03:20.880><c> be</c><00:03:21.000><c> to</c>

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
easiest way to do that seemed to be to
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.810 align:start position:0%
easiest way to do that seemed to be to
build<00:03:21.270><c> a</c><00:03:21.420><c> nuclear</c><00:03:21.780><c> fusion</c><00:03:22.050><c> reactor</c><00:03:22.200><c> so</c><00:03:23.190><c> just</c>

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
build a nuclear fusion reactor so just
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.580 align:start position:0%
build a nuclear fusion reactor so just
took<00:03:24.120><c> a</c><00:03:24.420><c> few</c><00:03:24.660><c> years</c><00:03:24.870><c> of</c><00:03:25.050><c> amassing</c><00:03:25.500><c> the</c>

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
would you do that though is it like a

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
shotgun approach or just make sure that
 

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.970 align:start position:0%
shotgun approach or just make sure that
they<00:37:36.059><c> encounter</c><00:37:36.749><c> a</c><00:37:36.779><c> lot</c><00:37:37.259><c> of</c><00:37:37.289><c> different</c><00:37:37.680><c> things</c>

they encounter a lot of different things
 

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.249 align:start position:0%
they encounter a lot of different things
