neurochemical II get out of this yeah so
 

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
neurochemical II get out of this yeah so
I<00:13:44.740><c> think</c><00:13:44.890><c> in</c><00:13:45.400><c> the</c><00:13:45.580><c> beginning</c><00:13:46.030><c> I</c><00:13:46.060><c> thought</c><00:13:46.480><c> that</c>

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:46.690 align:start position:0%
I think in the beginning I thought that
 

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.030 align:start position:0%
I think in the beginning I thought that
it<00:13:46.780><c> was</c><00:13:46.900><c> a</c><00:13:46.930><c> lot</c><00:13:47.200><c> higher</c><00:13:47.440><c> like</c><00:13:47.830><c> I</c><00:13:47.920><c> would</c>

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
it was a lot higher like I would
 

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
it was a lot higher like I would
probably<00:13:48.190><c> say</c><00:13:48.430><c> like</c><00:13:48.460><c> 70%</c><00:13:49.090><c> keto</c><00:13:49.840><c> and</c><00:13:50.020><c> I</c><00:13:50.110><c> first</c>

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.290 align:start position:0%
probably say like 70% keto and I first
 

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.750 align:start position:0%
probably say like 70% keto and I first
started<00:13:50.680><c> but</c><00:13:50.860><c> now</c><00:13:51.040><c> I</c><00:13:51.070><c> kind</c><00:13:51.430><c> of</c><00:13:51.460><c> look</c><00:13:51.640><c> at</c><00:13:51.700><c> it</c>

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
started but now I kind of look at it
 

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.210 align:start position:0%
started but now I kind of look at it
that<00:13:51.970><c> it</c><00:13:52.120><c> was</c><00:13:52.240><c> like</c><00:13:52.270><c> 70%</c><00:13:52.990><c> mindset</c><00:13:53.830><c> I</c><00:13:53.950><c> think</c>

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.220 align:start position:0%
that it was like 70% mindset I think
 

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.730 align:start position:0%
that it was like 70% mindset I think
keto<00:13:54.820><c> definitely</c><00:13:55.510><c> is</c><00:13:55.750><c> a</c><00:13:55.810><c> great</c><00:13:56.080><c> tool</c><00:13:56.470><c> but</c>

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:56.740 align:start position:0%
keto definitely is a great tool but
 

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
keto definitely is a great tool but
ultimately<00:13:57.190><c> if</c><00:13:57.670><c> you</c><00:13:58.060><c> aren't</c><00:13:58.480><c> getting</c><00:13:59.260><c> up</c>

00:13:59.520 --> 00:13:59.530 align:start position:0%
ultimately if you aren't getting up
 

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.530 align:start position:0%

blood reading so it's like you have to
be<00:37:40.760><c> a</c><00:37:40.910><c> little</c><00:37:41.450><c> bit</c><00:37:41.600><c> careful</c><00:37:41.840><c> and</c><00:37:42.290><c> obviously</c>

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:42.620 align:start position:0%
be a little bit careful and obviously

the urines
