00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
probably didn't realize it then but i
 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.149 align:start position:0%
probably didn't realize it then but i
was<00:03:25.599><c> building</c><00:03:26.239><c> this</c><00:03:26.720><c> feeling</c><00:03:27.120><c> that</c><00:03:27.360><c> i</c><00:03:27.599><c> need</c><00:03:27.920><c> to</c>

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
was building this feeling that i need to
 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.229 align:start position:0%
was building this feeling that i need to
do<00:03:28.400><c> as</c><00:03:28.480><c> much</c><00:03:28.720><c> as</c><00:03:28.879><c> i</c><00:03:28.959><c> possibly</c><00:03:29.440><c> can</c>

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
do as much as i possibly can
 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.229 align:start position:0%
do as much as i possibly can
so<00:03:30.480><c> that</c><00:03:30.879><c> we</c><00:03:31.120><c> never</c><00:03:31.440><c> have</c><00:03:31.599><c> to</c><00:03:31.760><c> go</c><00:03:31.920><c> through</c><00:03:32.080><c> this</c>

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
so that we never have to go through this
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.789 align:start position:0%
so that we never have to go through this
situation<00:03:32.720><c> again</c><00:03:32.879><c> so</c><00:03:33.040><c> that</c><00:03:33.599><c> as</c><00:03:33.680><c> an</c><00:03:33.840><c> adult</c>

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
situation again so that as an adult
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.550 align:start position:0%
situation again so that as an adult
um

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
um
things<00:03:36.799><c> will</c><00:03:36.879><c> be</c><00:03:37.040><c> different</c><00:03:37.280><c> for</c><00:03:37.440><c> me</c>

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
things will be different for me
 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.270 align:start position:0%
things will be different for me
so<00:03:39.040><c> i</c><00:03:39.200><c> was</c><00:03:39.440><c> fighting</c><00:03:40.000><c> and</c><00:03:40.159><c> i</c><00:03:40.239><c> was</c><00:03:40.480><c> fighting</c><00:03:41.120><c> to</c>

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
so i was fighting and i was fighting to
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.509 align:start position:0%
so i was fighting and i was fighting to
try<00:03:41.519><c> to</c><00:03:41.680><c> make</c><00:03:42.000><c> sure</c><00:03:42.239><c> that</c><00:03:42.640><c> that</c>

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that that
 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.350 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that that
i<00:03:43.680><c> kept</c><00:03:43.920><c> moving</c><00:03:44.239><c> forward</c><00:03:44.640><c> and</c>

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
i kept moving forward and
 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.949 align:start position:0%
i kept moving forward and
i<00:03:45.599><c> realized</c><00:03:46.159><c> that</c><00:03:46.319><c> if</c><00:03:46.480><c> it</c><00:03:46.560><c> was</c><00:03:46.720><c> going</c><00:03:46.879><c> to</c>

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
i realized that if it was going to
 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
i realized that if it was going to
happen<00:03:47.280><c> for</c><00:03:47.440><c> me</c><00:03:48.000><c> i</c><00:03:48.159><c> probably</c><00:03:48.400><c> was</c><00:03:48.560><c> going</c><00:03:48.640><c> to</c>

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
happen for me i probably was going to
 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
happen for me i probably was going to
have<00:03:48.879><c> to</c><00:03:48.959><c> make</c><00:03:49.120><c> it</c><00:03:49.200><c> happen</c><00:03:49.840><c> that</c><00:03:50.000><c> there</c><00:03:50.159><c> was</c>

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
have to make it happen that there was
 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.630 align:start position:0%
have to make it happen that there was
going<00:03:50.720><c> to</c><00:03:50.799><c> be</c><00:03:50.959><c> no</c><00:03:51.200><c> way</c><00:03:51.440><c> that</c>

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
going to be no way that
 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.309 align:start position:0%
going to be no way that
somebody's<00:03:53.040><c> going</c><00:03:53.120><c> to</c><00:03:53.200><c> swoop</c><00:03:53.599><c> in</c><00:03:53.760><c> and</c><00:03:53.840><c> just</c>

i think
that

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
that

everything that has been done before us
 

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.269 align:start position:0%
everything that has been done before us
is<00:16:20.560><c> a</c><00:16:20.639><c> part</c><00:16:20.800><c> of</c><00:16:20.959><c> us</c><00:16:21.920><c> and</c><00:16:22.079><c> so</c><00:16:22.320><c> it's</c><00:16:22.639><c> equally</c><00:16:23.120><c> as</c>

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
is a part of us and so it's equally as
 

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:24.870 align:start position:0%
is a part of us and so it's equally as

we were even born
 

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
we were even born
and<00:16:29.600><c> i</c><00:16:29.759><c> think</c><00:16:30.560><c> that</c><00:16:30.800><c> makes</c><00:16:31.120><c> it</c><00:16:31.279><c> even</c><00:16:31.519><c> more</c>

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that makes it even more

and i think that makes it even more
