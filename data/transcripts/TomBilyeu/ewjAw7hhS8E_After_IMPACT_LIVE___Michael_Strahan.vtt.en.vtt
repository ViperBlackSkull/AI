00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:00.890 align:start position:0%
important that and this interesting I
 

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:07.180 align:start position:0%
important that and this interesting I
hadn't<00:38:01.250><c> put</c><00:38:01.340><c> that</c><00:38:01.490><c> together</c><00:38:01.610><c> so</c><00:38:05.890><c> so</c><00:38:06.890><c> I</c><00:38:07.130><c> think</c>

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:07.190 align:start position:0%
hadn't put that together so so I think
 

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.100 align:start position:0%
hadn't put that together so so I think
we<00:38:07.370><c> should</c><00:38:07.400><c> pause</c><00:38:07.670><c> and</c><00:38:07.730><c> see</c><00:38:08.210><c> if</c><00:38:08.450><c> there</c><00:38:08.780><c> are</c><00:38:08.810><c> any</c>

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:09.110 align:start position:0%
we should pause and see if there are any
 

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.930 align:start position:0%
we should pause and see if there are any

boil it down to its physics and so for

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:17.850 align:start position:0%
it works just incredibly powerful so
 

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.100 align:start position:0%
it works just incredibly powerful so
you're<00:45:18.030><c> gonna</c><00:45:18.120><c> do</c><00:45:18.330><c> things</c><00:45:18.540><c> like</c><00:45:18.750><c> that</c><00:45:18.810><c> and</c><00:45:18.990><c> a</c>

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:19.110 align:start position:0%
you're gonna do things like that and a
 

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.910 align:start position:0%
you're gonna do things like that and a

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
lot of it's gonna have to do with
 

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.100 align:start position:0%
lot of it's gonna have to do with
research<00:45:20.250><c> to</c><00:45:21.240><c> really</c><00:45:21.540><c> take</c><00:45:21.690><c> control</c><00:45:21.780><c> of</c><00:45:21.990><c> your</c>

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
research to really take control of your

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:23.370 align:start position:0%

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:24.930 align:start position:0%
so I'd actually time the amount of time
