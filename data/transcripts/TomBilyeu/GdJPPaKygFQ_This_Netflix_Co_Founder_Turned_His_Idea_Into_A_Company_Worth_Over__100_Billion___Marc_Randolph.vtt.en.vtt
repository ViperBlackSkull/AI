you<00:48:01.359><c> are</c>

00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
you are
 

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
you are
in<00:48:02.319><c> it</c><00:48:02.720><c> right</c><00:48:03.040><c> in</c><00:48:03.200><c> that</c><00:48:03.440><c> instant</c>

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
in it right in that instant
 

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.990 align:start position:0%
in it right in that instant
and<00:48:04.480><c> it's</c><00:48:04.560><c> a</c><00:48:04.640><c> slow</c><00:48:04.880><c> state</c>

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a slow state
 

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.430 align:start position:0%
and it's a slow state
yes<00:48:06.480><c> yes</c><00:48:06.720><c> exactly</c><00:48:07.040><c> it's</c><00:48:07.119><c> a</c><00:48:07.200><c> form</c><00:48:07.359><c> of</c>

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes yes exactly it's a form of
 

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.190 align:start position:0%
yes yes exactly it's a form of
meditation<00:48:08.079><c> in</c><00:48:08.160><c> a</c><00:48:08.240><c> way</c>

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
meditation in a way
 

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.550 align:start position:0%
meditation in a way
um<00:48:09.680><c> and</c>

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
um and
there's<00:48:11.040><c> something</c><00:48:11.440><c> that</c><00:48:11.680><c> does</c><00:48:12.319><c> to</c><00:48:12.640><c> how</c><00:48:12.800><c> your</c>

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's something that does to how your
 

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.430 align:start position:0%
there's something that does to how your
brain<00:48:13.280><c> is</c><00:48:13.440><c> wired</c><00:48:14.319><c> to</c><00:48:14.480><c> do</c><00:48:14.640><c> that</c>

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
brain is wired to do that
 

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.230 align:start position:0%
brain is wired to do that
so<00:48:16.000><c> that</c><00:48:16.400><c> probably</c><00:48:16.960><c> for</c><00:48:17.119><c> me</c><00:48:17.599><c> is</c><00:48:17.839><c> the</c><00:48:18.000><c> common</c>

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that probably for me is the common
 

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.230 align:start position:0%
so that probably for me is the common
denominator<00:48:18.960><c> about</c><00:48:19.119><c> all</c><00:48:19.280><c> these</c><00:48:19.440><c> things</c><00:48:19.680><c> i</c><00:48:19.839><c> do</c>

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
denominator about all these things i do
 

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.390 align:start position:0%
denominator about all these things i do
the<00:48:20.319><c> second</c><00:48:20.720><c> thing</c><00:48:20.960><c> is</c><00:48:21.119><c> that</c><00:48:21.680><c> there's</c><00:48:22.240><c> an</c>

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that there's an
 

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.470 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that there's an
adrenaline<00:48:23.119><c> aspect</c><00:48:23.520><c> to</c><00:48:23.680><c> it</c>

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
adrenaline aspect to it
 

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.990 align:start position:0%
adrenaline aspect to it
um
