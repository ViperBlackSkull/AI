00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 align:start position:0%
adopting and fostering fostering would
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 align:start position:0%
adopting and fostering fostering would

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
be a temporary replacement of course if
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
be a temporary replacement of course if
you<00:00:39.870><c> end</c><00:00:40.110><c> up</c><00:00:40.230><c> falling</c><00:00:40.379><c> in</c><00:00:40.559><c> love</c><00:00:40.739><c> of</c><00:00:41.010><c> your</c><00:00:41.460><c> dog's</c>

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
question so let's say that somebody
 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.500 align:start position:0%
question so let's say that somebody
unfortunately<00:04:20.669><c> finds</c><00:04:20.880><c> himself</c><00:04:21.090><c> in</c><00:04:21.419><c> this</c>

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 align:start position:0%
unfortunately finds himself in this
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately finds himself in this
position<00:04:21.989><c> they</c><00:04:22.289><c> are</c><00:04:22.410><c> sort</c><00:04:23.099><c> of</c><00:04:23.160><c> social</c>

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 align:start position:0%
position they are sort of social
 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.940 align:start position:0%
position they are sort of social
isolationist<00:04:24.510><c> they</c><00:04:25.050><c> because</c><00:04:25.800><c> they're</c>

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 align:start position:0%
isolationist they because they're
 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.790 align:start position:0%
isolationist they because they're
bumping<00:04:26.310><c> into</c><00:04:26.430><c> people</c>

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
bumping into people
 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.869 align:start position:0%
bumping into people
the<00:04:26.889><c> time</c><00:04:27.039><c> they</c><00:04:27.129><c> don't</c><00:04:27.190><c> even</c><00:04:27.370><c> think</c><00:04:27.550><c> about</c><00:04:27.639><c> it</c>

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 align:start position:0%
the time they don't even think about it
 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
the time they don't even think about it
so<00:04:28.090><c> they</c><00:04:28.210><c> they</c><00:04:28.659><c> don't</c><00:04:28.810><c> have</c><00:04:28.960><c> a</c><00:04:29.080><c> network</c><00:04:29.289><c> of</c>

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 align:start position:0%
so they they don't have a network of
 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
so they they don't have a network of

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 align:start position:0%
so that that's the first thing I would
 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
so that that's the first thing I would
say<00:05:02.020><c> is</c><00:05:02.319><c> you</c><00:05:02.650><c> know</c><00:05:02.770><c> if</c><00:05:03.280><c> you're</c><00:05:03.490><c> reading</c><00:05:03.639><c> a</c><00:05:03.819><c> book</c>

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't read a book about kovat 19 because
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.089 align:start position:0%
don't read a book about kovat 19 because
there<00:05:08.259><c> probably</c><00:05:08.500><c> isn't</c><00:05:08.680><c> one</c><00:05:08.889><c> because</c>

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 align:start position:0%
there probably isn't one because
 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.610 align:start position:0%
there probably isn't one because
nobody's<00:05:09.610><c> written</c><00:05:09.879><c> the</c><00:05:09.940><c> book</c><00:05:10.120><c> yet</c><00:05:10.590><c> but</c><00:05:11.590><c> I</c>

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 align:start position:0%
nobody's written the book yet but I
 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
nobody's written the book yet but I
would<00:05:11.740><c> say</c><00:05:11.949><c> read</c><00:05:12.219><c> a</c><00:05:12.490><c> really</c><00:05:12.819><c> good</c><00:05:12.940><c> book</c><00:05:13.090><c> where</c>

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 align:start position:0%
would say read a really good book where
 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
would say read a really good book where
you<00:05:14.080><c> can</c><00:05:14.229><c> really</c><00:05:14.650><c> relate</c><00:05:15.009><c> to</c><00:05:15.069><c> the</c><00:05:15.310><c> characters</c>

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 align:start position:0%
you can really relate to the characters
 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
you can really relate to the characters
and<00:05:16.060><c> in</c><00:05:16.690><c> that</c><00:05:16.870><c> sense</c><00:05:17.319><c> we're</c><00:05:17.949><c> gonna</c><00:05:18.099><c> start</c><00:05:18.580><c> to</c>

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 align:start position:0%
and in that sense we're gonna start to
 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.879 align:start position:0%
and in that sense we're gonna start to
fire<00:05:19.090><c> off</c><00:05:19.360><c> these</c><00:05:19.629><c> brain</c><00:05:19.930><c> systems</c><00:05:20.440><c> that</c><00:05:20.770><c> are</c>

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 align:start position:0%
fire off these brain systems that are
 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
fire off these brain systems that are
around<00:05:21.250><c> you</c><00:05:21.789><c> know</c><00:05:21.909><c> really</c><00:05:22.270><c> around</c><00:05:22.780><c> like</c><00:05:23.050><c> being</c>

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 align:start position:0%
around you know really around like being
 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
around you know really around like being
able<00:05:23.379><c> to</c><00:05:23.530><c> put</c><00:05:23.860><c> ourselves</c><00:05:23.979><c> in</c><00:05:24.460><c> other</c><00:05:24.729><c> people's</c>

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 align:start position:0%
able to put ourselves in other people's
 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
able to put ourselves in other people's
shoes<00:05:25.330><c> and</c><00:05:25.599><c> I'm</c><00:05:26.199><c> good</c><00:05:26.469><c> I</c><00:05:26.650><c> would</c><00:05:26.800><c> guess</c><00:05:27.069><c> that</c>

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 align:start position:0%
shoes and I'm good I would guess that
 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
shoes and I'm good I would guess that
that<00:05:27.759><c> absolutely</c><00:05:28.360><c> can</c><00:05:28.810><c> foster</c><00:05:29.020><c> connection</c><00:05:29.620><c> as</c>

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 align:start position:0%
that absolutely can foster connection as
 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.950 align:start position:0%
that absolutely can foster connection as
well<00:05:29.919><c> but</c><00:05:30.580><c> it's</c><00:05:30.759><c> an</c><00:05:30.880><c> experiment</c><00:05:31.389><c> that</c><00:05:31.419><c> people</c>

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
well but it's an experiment that people
 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.050 align:start position:0%
well but it's an experiment that people
can<00:05:32.110><c> try</c><00:05:32.259><c> for</c><00:05:32.319><c> themselves</c><00:05:32.770><c> yeah</c><00:05:33.430><c> it's</c><00:05:33.759><c> one</c>

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 align:start position:0%
can try for themselves yeah it's one
 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
can try for themselves yeah it's one
that<00:05:34.270><c> so</c><00:05:34.630><c> I</c><00:05:34.659><c> was</c><00:05:34.930><c> thinking</c><00:05:35.289><c> about</c><00:05:35.349><c> this</c><00:05:35.650><c> like</c>

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 align:start position:0%
that so I was thinking about this like
 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
that so I was thinking about this like
I've<00:05:36.819><c> often</c><00:05:37.180><c> thought</c><00:05:37.330><c> about</c><00:05:38.460><c> because</c><00:05:39.460><c> I</c><00:05:39.759><c> don't</c>

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 align:start position:0%
I've often thought about because I don't
 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
I've often thought about because I don't
feel<00:05:40.389><c> compelled</c><00:05:40.990><c> to</c><00:05:41.169><c> be</c><00:05:41.409><c> around</c><00:05:41.740><c> people</c><00:05:42.159><c> which</c>

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to be around people which
 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to be around people which
I<00:05:42.490><c> think</c><00:05:42.759><c> would</c><00:05:43.060><c> surprise</c><00:05:43.599><c> people</c><00:05:43.930><c> but</c><00:05:44.169><c> I</c><00:05:44.199><c> find</c>

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 align:start position:0%
I think would surprise people but I find
 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
