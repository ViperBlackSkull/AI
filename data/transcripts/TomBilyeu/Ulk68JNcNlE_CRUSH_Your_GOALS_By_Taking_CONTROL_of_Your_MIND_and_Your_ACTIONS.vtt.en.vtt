00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
then there's no energy that's put into
 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.909 align:start position:0%
then there's no energy that's put into
building<00:07:14.240><c> that</c><00:07:14.400><c> up</c><00:07:14.560><c> and</c><00:07:14.720><c> i</c><00:07:14.800><c> think</c><00:07:14.960><c> that's</c><00:07:15.199><c> bs</c>

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
building that up and i think that's bs
 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.909 align:start position:0%
building that up and i think that's bs
so<00:07:16.560><c> you</c><00:07:16.800><c> think</c><00:07:17.039><c> that</c>

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
so you think that
 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.029 align:start position:0%
so you think that
that<00:07:18.240><c> desire</c><00:07:19.120><c> is</c><00:07:19.360><c> a</c><00:07:19.520><c> teachable</c>

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
that desire is a teachable
 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.189 align:start position:0%

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
concept desire is definitely a teachable
 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.909 align:start position:0%

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
concept the real question is
 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
concept the real question is
building<00:07:26.560><c> that</c><00:07:26.720><c> desire</c><00:07:27.199><c> will</c><00:07:27.440><c> that</c><00:07:27.680><c> actually</c>

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
building that desire will that actually
 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
building that desire will that actually
work<00:07:28.720><c> and</c><00:07:28.960><c> so</c><00:07:29.280><c> i</c><00:07:29.440><c> think</c><00:07:29.680><c> people</c><00:07:30.000><c> have</c>

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%

able to build something there so that's
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
able to build something there so that's
like<00:07:39.360><c> trying</c><00:07:39.680><c> to</c><00:07:39.919><c> start</c><00:07:40.160><c> a</c><00:07:40.240><c> fire</c><00:07:40.479><c> with</c><00:07:40.720><c> wet</c>
