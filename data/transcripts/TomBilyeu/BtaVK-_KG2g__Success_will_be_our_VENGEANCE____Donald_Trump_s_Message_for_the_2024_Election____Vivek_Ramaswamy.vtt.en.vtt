well<00:07:01.360><c> there</c><00:07:02.280><c> um</c><00:07:02.479><c> I</c><00:07:02.560><c> think</c><00:07:02.680><c> it's</c><00:07:02.919><c> amazing</c><00:07:03.400><c> that</c>

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
well there um I think it's amazing that
 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
well there um I think it's amazing that
he's<00:07:03.720><c> going</c><00:07:03.960><c> to</c><00:07:04.199><c> Libertarians</c><00:07:05.039><c> but</c><00:07:05.160><c> there's</c>

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
he's going to Libertarians but there's
 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.309 align:start position:0%
he's going to Libertarians but there's
also<00:07:05.800><c> if</c><00:07:05.960><c> Libertarians</c><00:07:06.479><c> are</c><00:07:06.599><c> going</c><00:07:06.680><c> to</c><00:07:06.840><c> break</c>

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
also if Libertarians are going to break
 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.589 align:start position:0%
also if Libertarians are going to break
my<00:07:07.879><c> guess</c><00:07:08.120><c> is</c><00:07:08.240><c> that</c><00:07:08.400><c> they</c><00:07:08.479><c> would</c><00:07:08.639><c> break</c><00:07:08.960><c> right</c>

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
my guess is that they would break right
 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.189 align:start position:0%
my guess is that they would break right
so<00:07:09.919><c> again</c><00:07:10.400><c> just</c><00:07:10.479><c> take</c><00:07:10.560><c> a</c><00:07:10.639><c> look</c><00:07:10.759><c> at</c><00:07:10.840><c> the</c><00:07:11.000><c> do</c><00:07:11.080><c> you</c>

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
