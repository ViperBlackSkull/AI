00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.870
Tom: Hi, everybody.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.290
Welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.059
You're here my friends, because you believe
that human potential is nearly limitless,

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.500
but you know as I do that having potential
is not the same as actually doing something

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.530
with it.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.790
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.509
are going to help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.210
All right, today's guest is a super level
badass.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.390
Not only is she a full-time corporate attorney
at Global Powerhouse Apple, she is undeniably

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.180
one of the toughest humans alive.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.969
It wasn't enough for her just to be a standout
attorney, so at 28 she go headlong into the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.489
impossibly grueling sport of obstacle course
racing.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.379
A sport where people actually die.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.250
Since beginning, she has racked up what is
arguably the most impressive resume of any

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.539
female in the sport.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.460
Her accomplishments prove that whatever men
can do, women can do just as well.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.800
In her career, she's had 30 victories and
more than 50 podiums.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.750
She's one of the 24-hour world's toughest
mother three times.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.780
One of those victories coming just eight weeks
after knee surgery.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.700
She was also the Spartan Race world champion
in 2013.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.090
She's been the Spartan Race Points Series
champion twice and she has three times finished

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.120
the death race, a race that is literally designed
to break you and has the slogan, "You may

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.240
live."

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.420
Having now also survived 2016, where she dumped
her year of healing after fracturing her femur

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.860
from all of the racing and training, she has
begun to discover yet another talent sports

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860
commentating.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.400
Even though she could make a living as a sponsored
athlete and commentator, she maintains her

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.420
intense day job at Apple to ensure that she's
challenged both body and mind.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.820
Please help me in welcoming the pop tart and
ketchup craving race ninja who has been called

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.310
the Michael Jordan of obstacle course racing,
Amelia Boone.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.030
Amelia, thank you so much for coming in the
show.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.890
Amelia: Thanks for having me.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.130
Tom: It is an absolute pleasure.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.720
Amelia: Yeah, I hope I can do an intro justice.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.810
Tom: You've already done that intro justice.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.250
It's really, really crazy what you've accomplished.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.610
I'll be honest, the thing that I'm most interested
in, obviously 2016 was a brutal year for you,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.069
but reading your blogs about what you've been
going through, I think is the thing that's

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.760
going to be most valuable to people.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.340
You talk a lot about doing the hard things,
but tell us what have you learned from rock

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.340
bottom?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.410
Amelia: Yeah, 2016 has been an interesting
year.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.969
For me, it was a fracture in the femur where
I had an entire year planned and then just

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.780
everything was wiped from that.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.230
For me, what I found is actually that hitting
rock bottom, that's the time where you are

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.680
forced to then really look inwards and discover
who you are.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.760
It's great when you're on top, when you're
riding this wave, when you're winning race

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.920
after race.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.770
It's easy to ignore the hard things.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.590
It's easy to ignore your problems or to just
push them aside or to think, "I'll deal with

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.430
that later," or just you're riding this wave.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.810
When you're sitting there and it's just you
and yourself, you have to confront that.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.189
For me, that's what this entire year has been.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:22.909
What's been so interesting to me actually
is that more people have come out to me and

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.029
said, "Yes, thank you.

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:26.370
You are relatable.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.180
This has been so helpful to me."

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.650
I'm learning that the more that I let people
in and say, "Look, I go through hard times

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.430
too that I hit rock bottom, that I suffer,
and that I am vulnerable," that people relate

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.639
to that.

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.739
It's been amazing.

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.999
Tom: Is that meaningful to you to be able
to help other people through this by sharing

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.999
your journey?

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.999
Amelia: I think so.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:59.430
I didn't start out that way, like when I started
out with obstacle race, and I didn't set out

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.279
to be an athlete.

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.040
For me, it was a fun jaunt with friends all
weekend.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040
Yeah, right.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.049
Tom: A 10-mile obstacle course through mud.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.719
Yeah, [crosstalk 00:04:08]
Amelia: Right.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.489
It was like, "Hey, let's get electrocuted
by these wires, and cool, and have a beer

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.889
at the end and get a headband."

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.020
I didn't intend for it to turn into a second
career, such as when I got injured, I didn't

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.360
intend to necessarily help other people with
it.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.290
When I realized the way that I deal with things
is through writing and through blogging, and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.669
for me it was almost a personal diary and
a journal.

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.319
I'm like, "If people read it, great.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.780
If they don't, fine."

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.350
For me, it's all about the process and healing
myself.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.360
That's been incredible, that has been able
to help other people.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.039
Tom: Yeah, it's amazing because when I started
the research, I didn't know that you'd gotten

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.039
injured.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.930
Tim and I had talked about you.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.211
He was on the podcast, he was wanting to put
you on my radar and then said the things that

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.780
you've accomplished were so incredible.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.419
We were like, "Oh my God, we got to get her
on the show.

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.560
It could be really amazing."

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.270
I dive another research and I'm hearing all
the stuff that you win and all these interesting

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.030
questions, which we will get to about like,
"Why women do better in longer races," which

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.250
is utterly fascinating to me.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.060
Then I discovered in realtime in the research
that you'd actually spent all of 2016 out

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.120
with an injury.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.500
Then you quintupled an interest for me, because
watching you process it out loud and really

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.610
go through that, and talk about things like
fear and the lessons that you were learning

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.139
from that was actually really motivating and
inspiring for me.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.370
What's a lesson that fear has taught you?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.520
Amelia: I think that I have learned that if
something is fearful to you, then you need

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.659
to do it and you need to explore it.

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.479
Fear is a very powerful emotion.

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.840
There were so many things that I was afraid
of this past year with injury.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.000
Tom: Like not being able to come back?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Amelia: Yeah.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.060
I'm still, a 110% honest, I still struggle
with that every single day.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.750
You lose that confidence as an athlete, whenever
you are knocked off of your pedestal or whatever

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.240
you're on your track and you're forced to
come back and question whether or not you

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.180
can, "get back to where you were."

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.270
That's something that you really have to work
through.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.229
I've never really had to deal with that just
self-doubt.

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:40.760
I think for me, fear is teaching me almost
to reframe and to think that it's not getting

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.900
back to where I was, it's shaping myself as
a new person going forward and to realize

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.870
and to embrace those opportunities.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.870
Tom: It's really incredible.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.639
You actually put something up on your mirror
when the injury happened.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.189
I forget the name of the book, forgive me,
but-

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.919
Amelia: Chery Strayed's, "Brave Enough."

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.069
Tom: Yes, thank you.

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.069
Perfect.

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.620
Here was a quote, "Fear, thank you for being
here.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.240
You're my indication that I'm doing what I
need to do."

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.740
Why do you think it is that, because I am
obsessed with that notion, like that really

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.349
sits at the heart of my being and this show
makes me incredibly anxious.

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.069
When we were originally talking about doing
this, I was like, "Oh, dear God."

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.440
I don't know that I-
Amelia: Like, "I don't want to be in a camera."

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440
Yeah.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.740
Tom: I truly had no desire to be upfront.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.250
That was not what I wanted to do, but because
it was one of those sayings that scared me

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.449
as much as it did and I have a rule in my
life, because I try to avoid pain so frequently,

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.410
that if it scares me, then I have to do it.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.479
Just to become the person that I want to be,
right?

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.870
Because I'm a person left to my own natural
inclinations.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.870
I'm very lazy.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.060
I'm very fearful and I will just recede into
the background and accomplish nothing.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.629
I found that the fear had something to do
with stakes and so I always put myself in

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:54.150
that situation.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.759
When did you develop that notion of fear being
a guiding light?

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.629
How are you using it now through what you're
going through?

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:06.020
Amelia: It's interesting, because I actually
throughout childhood and growing up, I was

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.310
not a risk taker.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.960
I still to this day, I don't consider myself
a risk taker.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.090
A lot of people would say, "When you enter
that first 24-hour race in New Jersey in December,

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.949
and it was 20-degrees when you were going
through ice in the middle of the night," is

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:21.360
that not taking risks?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.280
Tom: That's a fair question.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.199
Amelia: I think that what I've realized is
I'm like, "Okay, well this is a calculated

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.199
risk?"

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:33.090
No, I try and justify it.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:40.120
For me, confronting that fear, that first
of all, the first time you do it, it's so

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.889
paralyzing, but it becomes easier.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:49.170
You realize that and if you incorporate that,
if you make it a practice, then the day to

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.790
day things become easier.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:59.031
For me as a kid who was actually very fearful
and very I don't want to take risk, I want

00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:05.750
to stay inside this shell and this is my life
plan and I literally probably when I was 13

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.779
years old, had my entire life planned out.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:11.890
It is nowhere where I am right now.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.709
Thank God it's not.

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:20.750
I think that it's been through the experiences
of challenging myself and through confronting

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:26.500
that head on and embracing the fear, and embracing
the pain that I've then come to where I am.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.200
Tom: One of the stories you were telling you
said, "There's something to be said about

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.070
the [naivete 00:09:30] the beginner," and
that in the beginning I was actually less

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.019
afraid of obstacles than I am now like the
electricity, electric eel.

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:40.600
Did it make you blackout at one point?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.760
Amelia: It did.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.889
There's this awful-
Tom: It's the non-risk taker [crosstalk 00:09:44]?

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:51.970
Amelia: Right, yeah.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.900
It's also one of those things that I think
that you look back now and I see that obstacle

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.740
and I'm petrified of it, because of those
experiences that you associated with.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.279
I think at the time where you don't really
know what's going on, you're like, "Sure,

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:05.279
why not."

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:09.700
It's also the middle of the night and you're
exhausted, and you're not thinking straight,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.080
so you might as well get slapped in the head.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.720
Tom: I'm not sure I've ever had that thought.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:25.110
Amelia: I think that a guiding light for me
has always been that I want to seek that next

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:32.320
challenge and that I want to constantly find
a new hard thing.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:39.420
When I, the ripe old age of 28 started to
become, "A professional athlete."

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.899
It was just this new challenge for me.

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:44.510
It was, "How can I do that?"

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.810
Everything that I encounter, whether it was
that obstacle on that course that scared the

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:55.950
hell out of me, was going to be pushing myself
to that new limit.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.880
Tom: Do you think about identity at all?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.380
Like your own identity?

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.420
Amelia: I do.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:07.040
Actually, what's interesting is that I don't
know how to introduce myself to people, because

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.310
it also depends on who I'm talking to.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.730
Tom: That's interesting.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:16.070
Amelia: You meet people at a party and I say,
"Hi, I'm Amelia."

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.209
"Amelia, what do you do?"

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:20.699
Most people will give their profession.

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:25.630
Most people say, five years ago they said,
"Amelia, I'm an attorney."

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:31.060
Or this time around a bunch of athletes, do
I say, "I'm an obstacle racer."

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:36.389
Do I say, "I'm a ... " I go through this notion
of what I am.

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:41.440
I like that I don't have to define it and
I don't want to define it.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:49.339
I don't like the labels, because I've realized
now that I don't have to narrowly define myself

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:50.339
in a box.

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.840
Then I can constantly reinvent myself.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.240
I feel like not enough people do that or give
themselves the opportunities to do that.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.620
Tom: Yeah, reinvention to me has been really
important in my life.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:08.410
The way that I think about identity is maybe
adjacent to that, which is I have this vision

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.850
in my head about who I want to become.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.680
Part of the reason that I have to do the things
that scare me is because the person that I

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:20.120
want to become would do those things and that
as I tell myself, and I don't know if this

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.449
is just me or if a lot of people do this,
but I'm always telling myself a story about

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:27.100
myself like, "You're the type of person that
does that.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.160
You get out of bed fast.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160
You do this.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.000
You do things that scare you," all of that
to create this self-fulfilling prophecy in

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
myself.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.990
That's why it was so interesting for me to
hear that you would think that as you're doing

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.279
these obstacle races that they would get easier.

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:45.480
When you're saying that in some ways, they
actually get more difficult, that was really

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480
fascinating.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.870
You have a super interesting way of dealing
with that, which I'll call, "Chunking."

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.389
I don't know if you could use that word.

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:53.389
Amelia: I'll take that.

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:57.050
I'm a huge Goonies fan, so when it came out
it's like, "Truffle, shuffle, and chunk."

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.550
Tom: You'll go with?

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.649
Amelia: I'll go with, yes.

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:01.390
Tom: You break things up into small pieces?

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.390
Amelia: Yeah.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.720
I find that people get ... If you look at
the entirety of a task, it's very easy to

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.740
get overwhelmed.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:15.899
For me, you start a 24-hour race, so you start
a 100-mile race and you look at the clock

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:21.600
and you realize, "I have 22 hours left to
go and I'm exhausted right now."

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600
That's overwhelming.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600
That's when people quit.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.150
Instead, in my mind, I think, "Okay, if I'm
going through a really rough patch in a race,

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:34.040
because things ebbs and flows, I think just
get to the next obstacle.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.380
Just get to the next obstacle.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:43.730
Just get to the next lap and not think about
the entire, the grand scheme of things."

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.440
It's just these little compartmentalized in
things.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.981
When you're going through so much pain and
when you're going through a hardship, that's

00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:56.510
the thing that keeps me saying, "Is just to
not think about the end games, not try and

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:02.480
think about two days from now when this race
will be over," but just enough task at hand.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.610
Tom: Is there a certain way that you want
to be when it comes to pain?

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.350
Like, "I want to charge through pain," or
how do you conceptualize pain?

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.329
Amelia: I make friends with pain.

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:15.660
I think that pain is something that we're
so fearful of.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.400
We spend so much money trying to avoid pain
and, which is funny, because I think a lot

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:29.380
of the rise of these endurance races and obstacles
races is interesting as our lives would become

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.740
easier and we're able to avoid pain.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.649
People are actually paying to seek out pain.

00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:34.649
Tom: It's interesting.

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:36.050
I've never thought of it like that.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.050
Amelia: Right.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:43.481
There's a fantastic documentary that I'm a
part of called, "The Rise of the Sufferfests,"

00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:46.350
where the director actually chronicles the
rise of these races.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.509
It's a good look at it.

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:54.000
I make friends with pain, because I think
pain is something that teaches us so many

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
lessons.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.089
During a race, if I'm like, "Okay, all right,
my right hip hurts right now.

00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:02.550
All right, right hip, how are you doing?"

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.080
I actually will talk to my body.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.270
Then you work through it.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.270
It's a process.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.530
I actually find that it changes.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.980
There have been times where I started a 24-hour
race and my calf starting seizing out and

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.100
how am I going to make it through 24 hours?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.670
10-miles later, the calf is fine.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.320
I was onto the next thing.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.940
There's such a mind body connection, that
if you can talk to your physical pain, I find

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.360
it's much easier to deal with.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.620
Tom: Do you think mental toughness can be
cultivated?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.980
Amelia: I absolutely think so.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.529
Tom: What's that process?

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:42.779
Amelia: For me, I think that it's doing the
hard things.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:43.890
It's not taking the easy way out.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.290
Tom: Do you like to make a list?

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.650
Like, "These are the hard things."

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.650
Amelia: No.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.280
I think that the hard things are different
for everyone.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.850
I think that you know, because you go back
to that notion of fear.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.389
If you're fearful of it, that's a hard thing
for you.

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:05.600
For instance, I realized very early on when
I was trying to become an attorney that I

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.720
always had this notion that I want to be a
prosecutor and on stage, and things like that.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.769
I realized, "I don't do public speaking very
well."

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:17.860
That would seize up and it was awful for me.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.209
I hadn't-
Tom: It seems like I've seen you do public

00:16:19.209 --> 00:16:20.550
speaking very, very well.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.390
Amelia: It's one of those things that I've
had to cultivate and it's one of those things

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.390
that I've had to practice.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:36.820
I think that the hard things give you cultivate
that mental toughness.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.110
People say, "Okay, how do I make it a habit?

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.200
How do I cultivate mental toughness?"

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.519
I say, "That's what you do.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:45.519
You make it a habit."

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:52.551
It's that you don't give yourself the option
and it's something, you pick something, put

00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:57.269
it into your routine whether it's waking up
30 minutes earlier everyday so you can actually

00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:00.070
get out the door to move your body.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.149
You just don't think about it.

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:03.879
You don't give yourself the option to not
do it.

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:07.910
Tom: All right, talk to me about training
in non-ideal conditions, because that's one

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.939
of the tactics you use, right?

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:11.319
Amelia: Right.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.319
Yes.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.470
Training when it's raining outside.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.990
There are a lot of people if it's raining,
if it's snowing will say, "I'll get on the

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.839
treadmill today."

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.360
Why?

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:26.720
That's easy and it's boring.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.570
I love running when it's cold, running when
it's dark.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.429
Tom: Because you know you're getting more
tough that's why you love it?

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:38.330
Amelia: Also, part of me, I feel more alive.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.169
I like to be out on nature, and so I feel
more alive.

00:17:41.169 --> 00:17:48.010
I also think that, yeah it forces you to go
through hard things in non-ideal conditions

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:56.780
that then yes indirectly help cultivate ... Toughness
is a weird nebulous word and there's so many

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.330
different things that can go into that.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:08.520
I think what it does is that it cultivates
a willingness, and a drive, and a discipline

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.270
to get through those things.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.760
I think now, I'm like, "Okay, I used to live
in Chicago and I would go out and run when

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.260
it's -10 degrees."

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.730
If I can do that, I can definitely go out
and run in San Francisco when it's 60-degrees

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.070
and raining.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.760
It's all about comparisons.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.821
Tom: One of the writers that had written an
article about you said, I don't know if you

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:32.950
said this to him or if he just made it up.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.039
He said, "I think she runs in the rain and
when it's cold, because she knows that her

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.539
competitors are packing it up and going inside."

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:41.480
Is that true?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.880
Amelia: Maybe it used to be true, but now,
no longer.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.429
I think maybe I let out all my secrets and
no one ever else is doing it.

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:54.941
Yeah, I used to when I was training for World's
Toughest Mother that first year and we all

00:18:54.941 --> 00:18:59.680
ran in wetsuits, because you have to, because
it's freezing cold and you're in and out of

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.720
water, and you lose all your body heat over
24 hours.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.661
I would take my wetsuit out and go run around
in Chicago when it was 30-degrees and jump

00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:12.100
in and out of the lake.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.240
No one else was doing that.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.309
Tom: What a surprise.

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:16.340
Amelia: I know.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.840
Actually, the police officers really didn't
like it.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.520
It's weird to show.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:30.530
Those are the things that make you uncomfortable
and like we said, that uncomfortable tells

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.260
you, "Okay, that's what I need to be doing."

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.360
Tom: What I love about that is it's so simple,
right?

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:41.210
How do you deal with the things that are uncomfortable
or that you need to get more tough?

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.210
You go out and do them, right?

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.210
Amelia: Right.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.191
Tom: You set the alarm, you get up 30 minutes
earlier, you put your wetsuit on, you run

00:19:45.191 --> 00:19:50.840
when it's raining, you jump in the lake, things
that obviously are unpleasant, but in their

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.190
unpleasantness actually they begin to toughen
you.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.580
Have you read Angela Duckworth's book, Grit?

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.110
Amelia: No, I haven't.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.380
I have a list, like a list of books of mine
along and it's on there.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.400
It's moving up.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.340
Tom: Yeah, you could have been interviewed
for the book.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:10.610
I don't think there's any argument about that,
but it's just an amazing scientific recounting

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.990
of why it works, what's it play, how you actually
develop it.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.900
I think she was really one of the first people
to say that grit is a muscle.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.950
I think people think that a lot of foundational
things, like internal fortitude, you whether

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.899
have or you don't.

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:28.450
She really laid out like that is just not
true that you really can develop your grit.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.309
Is it again easier for you to jump in the
lake for instance, which I'm sure the first

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:37.510
time was pretty hard or is it actually maintained
it's difficult to be you just demand it?

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.270
Amelia: It comes and goes.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.080
I think there's certain things that definitely
get easier, but then there are also things

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.040
that it's funny, I don't ... People always
ask me if I do all the cold exposure and ice

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.000
bags, and things like that.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.200
Honestly, I have been so cold in all of these
races and so miserable, that I almost prefer

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.190
I'm like, "Unless there's a race on the line,
I like my hot showers."

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:13.510
It's this give and take about when I'm willing
to and when I'm not.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.620
It definitely is this one of those things
that I think that you can get out of practice

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:23.390
if you're not constantly exposing yourself
to those conditions, that it can be very pleasant

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.430
and great.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.170
Then you realize, you're like, "Oh no, wait.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.640
Wait, let's flex that muscle again.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.740
Let's train it."

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.840
Tom: That's interesting.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.140
Do you have a set routine that you do as you
prepare for something?

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.320
Do you cycle through those things like, "Now
is the time to be cold.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.250
Now is the time to do ultra long distance."

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.250
How do you prep?

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.270
What does that look like?

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.270
Amelia: Yeah.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.230
I think it definitely depends on the race
and exactly what I'm going for.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:52.360
I think yes, in terms of training, I cycle
through various points in the year in terms

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.770
of building strength, and then in terms of
building mileage, and then backing those down.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.950
Because what's interesting about obstacle
racing is that you have to be such a well-rounded

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:10.650
athlete and we have to mix this ultimate mix
of speed, and strength, and skill, and endurance.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:16.049
If you're a runner, if you go run a marathon,
you never really need to train your upper

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:21.820
body, but we're crawling over things and jumping
over things, and so you have to be so well-rounded.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.070
It's this fun little game of figuring out
the right combination.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.590
Tom: I love that you call it a fun game.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.200
People watching right now almost certainly
are dismissing you as just being, "She's so

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.200
gifted athletically.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.630
Of course, she's doing well at this," but
you actually couldn't do a pull-up when you

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.070
started these courses, if I'm not mistaken?

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.070
Amelia: No.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.220
I was very, very weak in terms of [absolute
training 00:22:43].

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.809
I spent six months trying to do a pull-up
to prepare for the race.

00:22:48.809 --> 00:22:51.740
I couldn't do it.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:57.040
I went onto that race and I fell off all the
obstacles, I had no strength, and I loved

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.830
it though, because to me, I all of a sudden
had this new challenge in front of me.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.450
I was like, "I was really bad at that.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.690
Let's try and get better."

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.039
I didn't come from a stellar athletic background
or anything like that, but I all of a sudden

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:15.200
found this new purpose.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200
I was [crosstalk 00:23:14].

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.601
Tom: When did you develop that, that you would
look at something that you failed at that

00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:22.170
you tried for six months and still failed
and go, "Wow, now I'm excited because I have

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.380
this challenge."

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.650
Amelia: A part of me has always had that.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.039
I don't like failure.

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:32.350
Nobody likes failure, fine.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.929
It's one of those things where it's almost
like I wanted to write it.

00:23:34.929 --> 00:23:40.600
It was one of those things that I failed at
that and now it is going to be my new task

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.140
to achieve that, to go do that.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:51.170
I think that that was one of the first things
that I realized of what really drew me to

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.170
this.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.450
Tom: Yeah, I loved when I came across that,
because I did assume that, oh you must have

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.490
been athletically gifted.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.340
Your physique is ridiculous and just crazy.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:05.380
As somebody being a quest and having worked
in the health and fitness industry like, "I

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.700
know physique."

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.549
Reading that you had started so far back from
that was really interesting.

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:15.590
To me, when you hit that moment where you're
really bad at something, you've got two choices.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.510
Choice one is the easy choice, it's the ever
present choice, which is "avoid."

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.100
I did not like that.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.179
I don't like failure.

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:24.220
Just like you said, everybody hates it.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.760
Most people do that left turn right there
and they say, "Okay, well, I'm not going to

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.929
be doing that again.

00:24:28.929 --> 00:24:33.220
There's a really interesting psychological
principle, which is to say, "Okay, well, now

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.600
I'm going to look at this as a challenge.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.940
I understand that the body, the mind can adapt.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.399
I'm going to develop this new skill."

00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:44.980
People that are able to do that either just
they have it in them or they cultivate that

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.940
in themselves, it's astonishing to see how
far they end up going.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.049
Amelia: To this day, I still have to do it.

00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:55.660
For instance, when I broke the femur, there
is very little I could do physically, because

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.650
bum leg, of course.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:03.179
They said, "You can get in the pool and you
can swim with a pool buoy between your legs."

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:07.140
I don't know if you've ever spent any time
swimming with pool buoy between your legs,

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.970
but it's really boring.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.350
It was the only thing that I could do.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.350
I'm not a swimmer.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:18.360
I don't frankly like swimming, but it was
my option.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.450
I sat there and I go, "All right, we're going
to make friends with the pool."

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:31.690
Really, for this past year, I have ... To
me, swimming is that hard thing, that failure

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:39.070
thing, because I'm not good at it, and I don't
like not being good at things.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:44.390
Over this past year, I've grown to actually
crave that time and in that pool and to do

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.390
that.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.500
There are things that I'm awful lot in my
flip turns.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.200
I look like a drowning corpus.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.330
It's really, really gnarly.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.730
If any of the swim coach looked at me and
they'd be like, "Oh my God."

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:04.270
To me, it was a way, especially in injury
to tackle a new challenge and to recognize,

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:09.169
and actually to be very humble about where
I was and what I could do.

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:15.340
I think that that makes you so appreciative
of everything else in life for sure.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.320
Tom: Other than swimming, what is something
that you're taking on as a challenge?

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.980
Amelia: This past year, I've actually gotten
into meditation as well, which is also something

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.809
that I've always [shootist 00:26:26].

00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:30.870
To me, running was my meditation.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:38.320
I always looked at my early morning runs as
my way to clear my mind, but the idea of sitting

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:45.529
still and just thinking nothing, to me it
was frightening.

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:48.220
I'm horrific at meditation.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.900
Sometimes I fall asleep.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:56.529
Sometimes it's 10 minutes later and I realized
that I've been planning my day, "Oh crap,"

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:58.820
but I still do it every single day.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.690
Thinking that someday it will get easier.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.399
Tom: You're a big believer in the power of
routine?

00:27:04.399 --> 00:27:07.970
Amelia: I am a huge believer in the power
of routine.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:14.330
For me, there are so many decisions that need
to be made in life.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:18.990
You cannot encounter that idea of decision
fatigue, so routine for me, it takes away

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:24.900
some of those decisions, so just becomes automatic.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:31.649
I feel best when I go through just have a
set planned.

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:37.520
That to me is the power routine, is really
taking away those decisions that you have

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.909
to make up, make every morning, and so you
can focus your energy on the big decisions

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:48.830
and what really needs your attention not,
"What am I going to eat today?

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.290
What time am I going to wake up?"

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:54.040
Tom: Since your injury, have you thought at
all differently about work and what you're

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.240
doing as an attorney?

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.450
Amelia: Yes.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:10.070
For me, the injury made me very, very grateful
that I was more than just enough.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.590
That to me, it was a time to also recognize
and reconnect to what I love about being an

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.110
attorney as well.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:22.580
What's interesting to me is that I actually
found it's sometimes harder to work, because

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.429
I didn't have the other ball in the air, for
instance.

00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:28.159
Tom: You've talked about that.

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:32.779
Amelia: That I am more productive when I am
juggling multiple things.

00:28:32.779 --> 00:28:33.779
Tom: Why?

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:38.190
Amelia: I think it forces you to be efficient.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.770
It's that if you know if I know, "Look, I
have to get out tomorrow morning to train

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:50.000
at four o'clock, so I need to get in bed by
X time, so I need to get all my work done,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.610
my attorney work done by X time so I can do
that."

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:59.140
Whereas if you don't have that, then just,
"Oh, I can procrastinate a little bit.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.230
I can take my time, blah, blah, blah."

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.169
I found that I'm more productive when I am
juggling multiple things.

00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:07.809
Tom: That's really interesting.

00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:12.190
Talk to me about self-flagellation a little
bit, which you've written quite eloquently

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.440
about.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.570
Yeah, what have you learned?

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:21.679
Amelia: Yeah, so I've talked about this, I
call it, "The merry-go-round of self-flagellation."

00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:24.769
Let's say you're feeling bad about something,
you're feeling bad about a failure, or for

00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:31.289
me, I sat there after the femur and I knew
that it was my fault.

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:35.950
I had run myself into a fracture in my femur.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:42.169
I went back through my mind all of the ways
that I could've changed that.

00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:48.700
You get on this merry-go-round as I called
it of you already feel bad that you screwed

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.620
up and that you wrecked your entire season.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.750
Then you feel bad, because you feel bad and
so you beat yourself up over feeling that

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:03.919
and just spirals into the circle and you can't
get off of it.

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:10.059
For me, I've had to step back and almost detach
myself and realize when I get into this story

00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:14.210
that I'm telling myself, and just stop it.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.450
It's really hard.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.060
I think we all do it.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.060
Tom: Do you have technique of these?

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.630
Amelia: I think really I try to depersonalize
it and detach it and to realize I almost think

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:27.510
of myself as a third person and say, "Okay
Amelia, you're on that right now.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.550
Stop."

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.200
If one of my friends came to me and said that
they were doing that to themselves, I'll be

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.600
like, "Get off of it."

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.600
That's the past.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.100
You can't change that.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.350
Beating yourself up over, something that happened
in the past isn't going to change it.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:46.520
Tom: What advice would you give to somebody
in your shoes, a true world class athlete,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.850
they've had this catastrophic injury, what's
your advice to them?

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.040
In that moment of uncertainty, when they don't
know if they're going to be able to come back

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040
or not?

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.320
Amelia: I think really, it's acceptance is
where you need to end up.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.970
You talk about it in stages of grief.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:08.769
Everyone talks about injury is like the stages
of grief after death almost not to be that

00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:12.539
traumatic.

00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:22.730
To realize that it's okay how you're feeling
and kick, scream, cry, do whatever it is you

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.980
need to do, let it out.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.029
Give yourself a time limit.

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:36.371
I said after my injury and I was miserable,
and I was just a bear to be around, but I

00:31:36.371 --> 00:31:42.160
told myself, "Okay, I'm going to give myself
two weeks to be an awful person about this."

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160
Then you know what?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.320
I'm going to pick up and move on and say,
"What can I do now in this scenario?"

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:54.841
Really what it was and what I found is I cut
myself off and then I looked out, "How can

00:31:54.841 --> 00:31:58.840
I make the best of this situation?"

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:04.720
For me, that ended up in being able to do
commentary work, and being able to be on the

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:13.230
course beyond the sideline to support my fellow
athletes, and actually take joy in their accomplishments,

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.980
in their victories instead of seeing them
as competitors.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.110
It's about reframing what you can do in that
moment.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.870
Tom: All right, so you brought up strong women,
which we have to go deep into.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.320
Why do women do better the longer the race?

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.780
Amelia: Women are better at suffering.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:36.280
I don't know if that's just because we, maybe
childbirth, I don't know.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:44.240
I don't necessarily think that women are tougher
or women have more mental grit, but there's

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.240
this definitely phenomena.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:52.880
You see, as the longer the race gets, the
gaps on a time between men and women tend

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.070
to lessen.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:02.330
You see a lot of women winning very long races
outright.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:10.560
I think that maybe, I don't have the ... If
I have the answers, I would probably be in

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560
a different field.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.700
I'd be in some type of psychological expert
and I'm so and so or physiological expert.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:23.590
For me, I've really found that women have
this ability to really pull down deep.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:30.559
I think for me, I realized that there's a
lot of things physically that I can't do on

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:33.250
the same level as men, so-
Tom: From a brute strength perspective?

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:38.460
Amelia: From brutes and I'm not going to compete
with dudes in a squat contest or a bench press.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:46.179
It's not going to happen, but what I can do
is outlast you.

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:51.070
That is something that I really, I don't know,
maybe it's a chip on my shoulder, but that's

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.790
really what drives me through those races.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:34:00.200
I think that maybe women, there have been
so many instances where we are told we can't,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.750
or we haven't, or that's not what things that
you're good at, that you carry that chip on

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.250
your shoulder and so in these long races,
it comes out.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.050
Tom: I love that.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.160
How do you use the chip on your shoulder effectively
and not let it be just bitterness?

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.170
Amelia: Exactly.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:23.060
I think it's a very hard fine line to not
cross over into.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.521
I think for me, it's always thinking you're
the underdog, is an effective way to do it,

00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:29.521
even when you're not.

00:34:29.521 --> 00:34:31.120
Everyone likes being the underdog.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.820
I loved it when I first came into this and
nobody knows who you are and then all of a

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.840
sudden you're there.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.890
"Damn, and who is this woman?"

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:43.480
It's keeping that underdog mentality even
when you're not.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:49.790
I think for me, for instance when I was also
on the top of the sport and winning everything

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:53.830
and doing that, I still always try to view
myself as the underdog.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:35:01.600
That's hard to do, because you have the target
on your back, but just keeping that mentality

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.890
for me has been very helpful.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.320
Tom: You said that women can really dig deep.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.080
Is there any of that, that you can articulate?

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.810
I know you use a distraction technique to
keep yourself focused.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:16.830
What are some other techniques that are the
active digging deep?

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:24.800
Amelia: Yeah, for me, I think the digging
deep and races also comes up in interacting

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.100
with those around you.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:33.930
The distraction in terms of compartmentalizing,
chunking the race, but then also just stopping

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:39.720
to think entirely and by doing that by interacting
with those racers around you.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:45.800
That's great thing about long races is that
you have time to chat with people, because

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.530
you're out there for so long and you're going
out a slow enough pace.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:55.330
I always try and if I'm running the same pace,
another competitor, "How are you doing?

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.330
Where you from?

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.340
How are you feeling?"

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.350
Getting to know them.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.420
Sooner or later, you realize that a few miles
have gone by and you haven't been thinking

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.680
about yourself, you've been thinking about
other people.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:14.310
I think that that's very powerful is if you
take the focus off of yourself and focus on

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.900
others, you can almost ignore the pain that
you're going through.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.950
I don't know.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:25.280
Maybe women as women are more stereotypically
more nurturing, more caring, that ability

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.160
to then tap into other people.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160
I don't know.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.290
No one's ever described me as extremely nurturing.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:40.820
It's not like number one attribute, but I
do generally enjoy getting to know other people

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.560
and learning about other people.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.320
Tom: Yeah, that's interesting.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.610
To your point about, I guess if we could really
explain this, we'd be in a different field,

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:55.050
but as somebody who's married to a woman who
is just gritty beyond reason and really beyond

00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:00.630
reason, and will to the point like you, she'll
get injured and she'll keep working out, and

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:05.240
she'll be like, "Yeah, tomorrow for sure I'm
taking tomorrow," and I wake up to the sound

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.380
of weights clanking down.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.750
I'm like, "Wait a second, I thought you're
taking the day off?"

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.190
"Yeah, no I felt good."

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:20.700
I pride myself and my ability to suffer, I
can suffer my friend, but my wife?

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.650
It is inhuman, I guess really crazy.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:27.300
Amelia: It is, but what's interesting and
what I've learned is that there is a difference

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:33.710
of what ... The thing that has made me so
great at this sport, my ability to suffer

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.710
my ability to brace pain is also my greatest
downfall.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:42.540
It's also my greatest weakness, because I
will push myself past the part point of being

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.450
smart.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.130
That is what has led to injury for me.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.910
This past year, I've had to realize like,
"It's okay to rest.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.270
It's okay to take a few days.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:59.030
It's okay to take a few weeks or few months
and actually take care of your body."

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:04.290
That's almost become such a dirty word for
some of us, that four letter word of rust

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:09.250
is the worst four letter word out there.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:15.530
It's sometimes the hardest thing, the hardest
thing for me this past year has been to take

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.980
care of my body.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.440
It's interesting how that goes around and
comes around.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.950
Tom: Do you ever struggle with knowing if
you're resting because it's the right thing

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.890
or you're resting because you want to be lazy?

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.650
Amelia: No, I don't.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.190
Tom: That's my big downfall.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.190
Amelia: Really?

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:36.180
Tom: That's why I push myself past the point
of what some people consider reasonable, because

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:43.270
in my head is a voice that is so catastrophically
lazy, that I have to push like my wife will

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:44.270
be telling me, "You're sick.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:45.270
You need to rest."

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.280
I can't let myself do it, because that's what
I want so badly.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:54.900
I've learned that doing what feels good is
rarely the thing that moves me towards my

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.900
goals.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.900
Amelia: Right.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:03.640
Yeah, I struggle more with that if I'm resting,
I feel lazy and I hate that.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:11.210
I'm saying we've associated rest with laziness,
which isn't the case necessarily.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:18.760
I'm trying to create this Twitter movement
of epic rest days or rest day [inaudible 00:39:17],

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.840
because people go out there and they are like,
"I'm bragging about this 30-mile or I just

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.110
crashed and it's so epic bro."

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:28.450
I'm like, "You know what?

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.560
I walked a thousand steps today.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.780
I ate a tub of ice cream, [#restdayrest 00:39:33].

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.040
It's not so bad.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.010
It's about balance, right?

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.010
Tom: Right.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.200
No, that's really interesting.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.200
My wife and I actually get in fights with
each other, because from the rationale perspective,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.500
the other person seems crazy.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.190
When she is pushing herself to ridiculous
extremes like, "What are you doing?"

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.280
Her retort is always, "This is exactly what
you do when you're sick."

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.750
It's like, "Okay, that's a little harder to
argue."

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:01.100
Amelia: It's very easy for me to dish out
advice to other people, it's so hard for me

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.740
to take it.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:08.320
I think that, that's also something I've really
tried to do this past year is try to live

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:15.450
authentically, to lead by example, and to
make sure that if I'm telling somebody something

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.780
that this is what they should do X, Y, and
Z, that I'm also doing it myself.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:23.970
I feel like there's so many people out there
that can spew advice and they can set up a

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:28.210
life that looks so perfect on the outside.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:34.640
They can create anything through social media,
but it's not authentic, and there's that weird

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.390
disconnect and I hate that.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:44.280
For me, this past year especially, admitting
vulnerability and admitting when I'm struggling

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.720
is part of that entire trying to live authentically.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:53.170
Tom: What would you say to a young girl who
struggles with just feeling inadequate?

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.400
Amelia: I can imagine being a teenager right
now.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.200
I remember how hard it was for me at that
age.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:08.710
Now with social media, it boggles my mind.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:17.350
I think especially for younger girls, it's
about, "Don't limit yourself.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.930
Don't label yourself.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:25.140
Constantly try and break boundaries and barriers.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.850
You don't have to choose."

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:32.590
I think for me, one of the greatest compliments
I can get and I never set out for this are

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:36.620
people that come to me and parents that come
to me and say, "We struggle for female role

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.930
models in this world.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:43.930
Thank you for being a female role model for
our daughter, something that can use their

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.880
brains, can use their body."

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.640
I never set out to be a role model, but to
me that's so powerful.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:57.800
I, especially for younger girls is that don't
label yourself.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.170
Don't give into what is popular, because what's
popular is definitely not necessarily not

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.080
what's right.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.320
Challenge yourself physically.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:13.020
Challenge yourself mentally and look to break
those barriers.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:19.950
That to me is you see a strong ... When I
see images of strong girls coming to races,

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.920
you have all these girls now interested in
obstacles racing and that's phenomenal to

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.910
me, because it's about being functional.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.220
It's not about looking a certain way, it's
about what your body can do for you and achieving

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:34.830
things, and carrying heavy things, and surviving
hours in the woods.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:40.090
Tom: It really is a pretty incredible test.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:45.270
Talk to me though about when racing stop being
fun for you at least for a minute?

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:53.510
Amelia: Yeah, so people always ask me, "Now,
would you quit being an attorney to be a full-time

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.350
racer?"

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:58.570
I never really seriously considered it for
a number of reasons.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:02.150
One of them is also racing to me has always
been the stress release.

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.800
It's always been my outlet.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:12.780
As soon as you start making it your bread
and what puts food on the table, it becomes

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.210
not fun.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.230
That was the reason why I always kept all
that.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.950
Tom: How do you think that robs the fun out
of it?

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:25.380
Amelia: Because it no longer is just winning
just the cool thing, it's then winning because

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:31.670
of the expectation and there's that pressure
that surrounds it.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:37.690
I avoided that scenario, but I think for me
racing, I went through a period where racing

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:45.500
stopped being fun because I felt like if I
wasn't winning, I was letting everyone else

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:50.510
down, that it was expected that I was on the
top of that podium.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:56.060
That all of a sudden, when I got 4th at Spartan
Race World Championships, people, and I was

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.650
supposed to win, it was like, "What happened
to Amelia?"

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:02.350
I was just like, "Guys, I got 4th."

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:06.950
Tom: It's actually not so bad.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.560
Amelia: I know.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:15.540
It was this, all of a sudden what I realized
is I was letting other people's expectations

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:20.950
get to me, as supposed to just thinking about
myself.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:27.130
I race because I love it, whether that's winning
a race or whether that's coming in dead last,

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.520
whether that's doing a race on crutches.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:37.320
It's really trying to just harness in on the
original reasons that I started all this.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.630
Tom: If you had to define confidence, how
would you define it?

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:48.740
Amelia: Confidence for me is not making apologies
for how you're living or what you're doing.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.180
Tom: Not even feeling like you have to or
just not doing it?

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:59.570
Amelia: Just being able to make decisions
and to own that, and to not care about all

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:00.880
the noise.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.000
They may be the wrong decisions, but you need
to stand by them, for me.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.010
Tom: All right.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:09.960
When you had the injury and everything, you
said that it really, really shook your confidence.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.260
How did you rebuild it?

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.770
What does that process look like?

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:16.690
Amelia: Honestly, I'm still working through
it.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:25.600
I'll let you know in a few months, but to
me, it's celebrating the little victories

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.880
for sure.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.970
The first time that I-
Tom: Letting those build like momentum and

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.970
confidence in you?

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:37.580
Amelia: Yes, for sure, because every single
little victory is going to create that bigger

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.270
sense of self.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:46.500
That first run back where I did a mile, and
it was high-five.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:53.351
I thought like I had just run a hundred miles,
but it was that little wave, that if you can

00:45:53.351 --> 00:45:55.190
keep building on those.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:46:00.120
Unfortunately, it's never going to be a smooth
linear progression.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.170
Those little setbacks are the times where
you need to realize, "Okay, it's just a bleep

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:05.170
on the radar.

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:11.800
It's going to look like this, but as long
as you can see that goal towards the end and

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:17.360
embrace that process, that's really how I've
been rebuilding it."

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.260
Tom: That's really incredible.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:25.790
If you were in Stephen Hawking situation,
what would you shift your attention to?

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:31.970
Amelia: Yeah, so I've actually asked, if I
couldn't race and if I couldn't express myself

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:35.190
physically, because I've talked about it,
is that I've ... When I haven't been able

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.550
to use my legs, I've had to use my voice.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:45.260
What's really been empowering for me this
past year is to be an advocate for the sport,

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.950
be an advocate for obstacle racing.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.351
It's such a new sport.

00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:54.210
We have such an opportunity as athletes to
help shape it in where it goes and will it

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.190
make it to the Olympics or what will it do?

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.640
For me, it would be shaping that.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:07.320
Also, really, I'm really passionate about
women in sport and about women and women equality

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.680
in sport, things like that.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.850
It's using that voice.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:11.700
Tom: How do you think we get to that?

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:18.930
Amelia: Man, that's been a question for how
many years at this point.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:24.030
We've come a long way, but it's really just
more and more, it's women standing up, but

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.010
it's also men standing up.

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:33.580
It's everyone regardless of making sure that
price pursues for women are the same across

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580
genders.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.180
You see some sports where men get a hundred
thousand dollars and women get $50,000 for

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.240
winning the same freaking race.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.010
I don't get it.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:53.310
That is something that there needs to be a
constant dialog about it.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.710
Unfortunately, we're still not there, but
we're getting there.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.690
Tom: I know the quorum is going to force you
to give me a really humble answer to this

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:06.150
question and I'll maybe push you a bit, but
what do you think your impact has been by

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:11.200
you beat the vast majority of the men that
you race against, the vast majority.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.200
Do you think that's helping?

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:17.360
Do we need more people that are playing at
that level that can really show up and dazzle,

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.360
quite frankly?

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:24.850
Amelia: What I want the impact to be is to
start to normalize that conversation, because

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:34.540
people will say, "Oh my gosh, you got 2nd
overall," or she won that 50k outright like

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.780
it's some crazy strange thing.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.780
That's great.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:45.900
It brings attention to it, but if we keep
thinking about that as an outlier, it's not

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.050
going to shift.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.300
We need to be like, "Look.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.300
Dude, that woman won.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.300
That's awesome.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.300
That's cool.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.560
That a woman won outright."

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.970
If we can normalize that, then that's when
I think we've really made progress.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:04.020
Tom: Have you seen the studies that they've
done on "throwing a girl?"

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:09.440
Amelia: Some of them, but they keep emerging,
so I don't know exactly what you're saying.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.180
Tom: Just that it's so incredible, it has
nothing to do with being a girl and it has

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.120
only to do with whether you keep throwing
or not and that boys tend to keep throwing

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.220
and girls are encouraged to go do other things
and so they just stop and that boys when they

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.230
first are throwing, throw like a girl.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.040
It's just that sheer repetition.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.490
When you were saying really pushing the boundaries
that that's what you would want for a young

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:32.270
woman, that to me, you want to talk about
getting equality in the sport.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:36.320
Honestly, I think there really is only one
answer, so I always play a game with myself

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.110
like, no bullshit, what would it take?

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:43.540
No bullshit, what would it take for female
athletics and male athletics to be on par?

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:48.000
I think it takes you, it takes people like
you that show up, they play to win, they push

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.040
the boundaries, they show that they're able
to play at a level that's impressive to watch.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.060
I look at you and I'm not inspired, because
you're a woman.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.700
I'm inspired because you're a badass and that
it-

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.700
Amelia: That's what I want.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.880
Not because I'm a badass, I have to feel like
I'm [sober 00:50:02].

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.110
Tom: I think you could say that.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:10.520
Amelia: I want it to be regardless of gender,
that I want it to be, because you're right.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:15.280
I grew up playing softball and so I'm sure
I threw like a girl at first, but I throw,

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.670
I was a pitcher and now I play softball very
well.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:26.170
It's normalizing that and breaking down where
we don't see the gender anymore.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:32.100
Unfortunately, to not see the gender, we almost
for a while have to be hypersensitive to it

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.670
or that's at least the realm that we're in
right now.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:41.100
How do we shift from that hypersensitivity
to then being blind to it?

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:47.740
Tom: Yeah, so trust me, I do not wish Stephen
Hawking upon you, but the voice that you have

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:52.590
learned to speak in and I think other women
are going to see that and they're going to

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.510
realize that's got to be a part of the strategy,
of finding that equality is to be able to

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.680
speak out, to encourage them to push the boundary,
just to say that they can do it, that it's

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:05.510
a valid choice I think is going to go a long
way towards doing that, getting more people

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.510
adapting it early, developing their prowess
and then we can see really what they're capable

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:12.180
of doing, which is pretty incredible.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.600
Just seeing them blossom in this endurance
events I think is really going to make people

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.590
question their own assumptions about what
women are capable of.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:26.310
Amelia: Yeah, we just had an ultra runner
in Texas in this 100K.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:27.660
She won it outright.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:32.251
She won outright and you're seeing this more
and more.

00:51:32.251 --> 00:51:40.440
It's one of those things to keep that conversation
going, that I think is really important.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.420
Tom: It's amazing.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.590
I'll be very interested to see how far we
can take this.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.680
I hope that you certainly stay very, very
invested in the sport whether it's competing,

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.730
commentating, obviously you won't be able
to compete forever, but a voice is pretty

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:54.730
missed.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:55.730
Amelia: I don't know.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.080
Thinking about the endurance sports is that
you tend to peak later on.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.660
I'm always like, "Oh, I'm 33 and I feel so
broken."

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:09.990
I'm like, "No, I'm still doing this as long
as it's fun and as long as my body lets me."

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:12.210
I'm excited for the ride.

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.610
Tom: What's the impact you want to have on
the world?

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:21.000
Amelia: My God, that's such a good question,
because I think that the impact that you think

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.130
that you want isn't always the impact that
you end up having.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:29.570
If you'd ask me that question 10 years ago,
I would have given you a completely different

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.570
answer.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:31.570
Tom: What would the answer been 10 years ago?

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:41.080
Amelia: It would have been, be a partner at
a law firm and have my 2.5 kids, and married.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.010
It was listing under dream or whatever.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:53.090
I realized now that what I see, what I want
to do is live authentically, live by example.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:59.290
Also, what I've really learned and to know
that you don't have to fit in these boxes

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:06.910
and that you may not be able to have it all,
but there are opportunities there to always

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:14.030
pivot into reinvent yourself and that especially
for young girls is you don't have to choose.

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:18.040
You don't have to choose brains, you don't
have to choose beauty, you don't have to choose

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.080
strength.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:24.820
You can have them all and you can incorporate
those into your life.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:31.030
For me, it's not having this massive global
impact, it's the small little connections

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:36.270
that I make to people through all these to
the girls running those obstacle races that

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:42.430
are 10, 11 out there, that I can have those
impacts on those little ... those little impacts

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.690
on peoples' lives, then I think that adds
up to the big one.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.010
Tom: That's incredible.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.200
Where can these guys find you online?

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.680
Amelia: Twitter at Amelia Boone.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.220
I'm on Instagram at arboone11.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:58.040
Facebook, I have a website that desperately
always needs updating.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.590
Tom: That's amazing blog content, really,
really great.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:02.590
Amelia: Thank you.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.910
Yeah, so my blog ameliabooneracing.com.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:06.060
You can find it there.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:10.460
I don't get to write as often as I would like,
but it's one of my favorite things.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.980
Tom: Your blog is titled in Latin.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.980
Amelia: It is.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.630
Tom: What does that stand for?

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:23.670
Amelia: Race Ipsa Loquitur is a doctrine in
law that means, "The thing speaks for itself."

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:24.670
Tom: That's cool.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:33.290
Amelia: It was a play on race, which is R-E-S
and then I made it R-A-C-E, yeah so I was

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:34.310
corporate in a little law.

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:35.310
Tom: That's good.

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:36.310
I like it.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.540
Amelia, thank you so much for coming on the
show.

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:39.880
It was absolutely incredible.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880
Amelia: Thank you.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.220
Thanks for having me.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.220
Tom: All right.

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.330
Guys, you're going to want to dive into her
world on this one.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.350
It is absolutely incredible.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:52.110
What you're going to see is somebody who has
really found their voice both physically and

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.650
just from the perspective of being able to
articulate things for people.

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.970
What she does physically is unbelievable.

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:03.680
It will make you challenge every assumption
you have about what a human can do, let alone

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.191
what a woman can do and when you see the footage
of her crying in the ice cold river, and she

00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:13.040
just keeps going in one of the death races,
which she has completed three times.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.780
By the way, it is absolutely astonishing to
watch a human push the boundaries.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.360
When she said that, "I hope that you guys
got the chills like I did," that is unbelievable

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.890
to encourage people to push boundaries.

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:26.830
I hope you guys are pushing the boundaries
in your life, not accepting limitations, pushing

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.130
your mind as hard as you push your body.

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:33.350
This is somebody who is a role model for me
to be certain and I hope as a role model for
