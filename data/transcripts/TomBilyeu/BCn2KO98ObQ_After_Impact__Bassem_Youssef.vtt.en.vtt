00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.100 align:start position:0%
to bring them on to extract like that
 

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
to bring them on to extract like that
process<00:17:03.580><c> of</c><00:17:03.730><c> it</c><00:17:03.850><c> like</c><00:17:04.120><c> that's</c><00:17:04.329><c> actually</c><00:17:04.750><c> me</c>

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.230 align:start position:0%

is the answer so I will say that I'm
 

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.289 align:start position:0%
is the answer so I will say that I'm

00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:10.649 align:start position:0%
I'd be all about it so I think he's

00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
allows you to interpret it's like a tool

allows you to interpret it's like a tool
that<00:25:57.960><c> allows</c><00:25:58.110><c> you</c><00:25:58.259><c> to</c><00:25:58.700><c> shorthand</c><00:25:59.700><c> interpret</c>

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:00.269 align:start position:0%
that allows you to shorthand interpret
 

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:02.060 align:start position:0%
that allows you to shorthand interpret
something<00:26:00.509><c> yes</c><00:26:00.809><c> ok</c><00:26:01.409><c> it's</c><00:26:01.620><c> a</c><00:26:01.679><c> rule</c><00:26:01.919><c> of</c><00:26:01.950><c> thumb</c>

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
something yes ok it's a rule of thumb
 

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.610 align:start position:0%
something yes ok it's a rule of thumb
yeah<00:26:02.669><c> so</c><00:26:03.090><c> why</c><00:26:03.330><c> people</c><00:26:03.750><c> gave</c><00:26:03.960><c> it</c><00:26:03.990><c> the</c><00:26:04.259><c> super</c>

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so why people gave it the super
 

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.289 align:start position:0%
yeah so why people gave it the super
fancy<00:26:04.799><c> name</c><00:26:05.070><c> heuristic</c><00:26:05.519><c> I'm</c><00:26:05.669><c> not</c><00:26:05.789><c> sure</c><00:26:06.000><c> and</c>

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
fancy name heuristic I'm not sure and
 

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:07.909 align:start position:0%
fancy name heuristic I'm not sure and
why<00:26:06.450><c> they</c><00:26:06.629><c> don't</c><00:26:06.809><c> just</c><00:26:06.870><c> say</c><00:26:07.139><c> a</c><00:26:07.169><c> heuristic</c><00:26:07.710><c> is</c>

00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
why they don't just say a heuristic is
 

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
why they don't just say a heuristic is
literally<00:26:08.580><c> a</c><00:26:08.610><c> rule</c><00:26:08.820><c> of</c><00:26:08.970><c> thumb</c><00:26:09.000><c> I'm</c><00:26:09.360><c> also</c><00:26:09.570><c> not</c>

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:09.809 align:start position:0%
literally a rule of thumb I'm also not
 

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:13.460 align:start position:0%
literally a rule of thumb I'm also not
sure<00:26:10.190><c> so</c><00:26:11.190><c> a</c><00:26:11.730><c> heuristic</c><00:26:12.480><c> is</c><00:26:12.899><c> a</c><00:26:12.929><c> rule</c><00:26:13.289><c> of</c><00:26:13.440><c> thumb</c>

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:13.470 align:start position:0%
sure so a heuristic is a rule of thumb
 

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
sure so a heuristic is a rule of thumb
it's<00:26:13.769><c> something</c><00:26:14.279><c> that</c><00:26:14.490><c> allows</c><00:26:14.610><c> you</c><00:26:15.090><c> to</c><00:26:15.120><c> very</c>

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:15.809 align:start position:0%
it's something that allows you to very
 

00:26:15.809 --> 00:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's something that allows you to very
