of<00:00:36.719><c> people</c><00:00:37.040><c> view</c><00:00:37.200><c> it</c><00:00:37.280><c> a</c><00:00:37.360><c> lot</c><00:00:37.520><c> more</c>

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
of people view it a lot more
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
of people view it a lot more
fundamentally<00:00:38.160><c> than</c><00:00:38.320><c> i</c><00:00:38.399><c> do</c><00:00:38.559><c> but</c><00:00:38.800><c> it's</c><00:00:38.960><c> from</c><00:00:39.120><c> my</c>

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
fundamentally than i do but it's from my
 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.549 align:start position:0%
fundamentally than i do but it's from my
perspective<00:00:39.680><c> very</c><00:00:39.920><c> surface</c><00:00:40.160><c> level</c><00:00:40.320><c> i</c><00:00:40.399><c> think</c>

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
perspective very surface level i think
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.310 align:start position:0%
perspective very surface level i think
the<00:00:40.640><c> general</c><00:00:40.960><c> definition</c><00:00:41.680><c> in</c><00:00:41.840><c> psychology</c>

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
the general definition in psychology
 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
the general definition in psychology
would<00:00:42.480><c> be</c><00:00:42.719><c> your</c><00:00:42.879><c> consistent</c><00:00:43.360><c> attitudes</c><00:00:43.760><c> and</c>

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be your consistent attitudes and
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.430 align:start position:0%
would be your consistent attitudes and
behaviors<00:00:44.320><c> over</c><00:00:44.559><c> time</c>

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
behaviors over time
 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
behaviors over time
so<00:00:45.760><c> that's</c><00:00:46.000><c> basically</c><00:00:46.399><c> it</c><00:00:46.559><c> it's</c><00:00:46.960><c> how</c><00:00:47.120><c> you</c>

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
so that's basically it it's how you
 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
so that's basically it it's how you
consistently<00:00:47.680><c> show</c><00:00:47.840><c> up</c><00:00:47.920><c> in</c><00:00:48.000><c> situations</c><00:00:48.480><c> how</c>

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
consistently show up in situations how
 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.869 align:start position:0%
consistently show up in situations how
you<00:00:48.719><c> respond</c><00:00:49.039><c> to</c><00:00:49.200><c> situations</c><00:00:50.399><c> and</c><00:00:50.559><c> from</c><00:00:50.719><c> my</c>

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
you respond to situations and from my
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.150 align:start position:0%
you respond to situations and from my
perspective<00:00:51.360><c> there's</c><00:00:51.520><c> an</c><00:00:51.600><c> enormous</c><00:00:51.920><c> amount</c>

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
perspective there's an enormous amount
 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.549 align:start position:0%
perspective there's an enormous amount
of<00:00:52.320><c> factors</c><00:00:52.879><c> that</c><00:00:53.039><c> lead</c><00:00:53.280><c> to</c><00:00:53.520><c> how</c><00:00:53.680><c> you</c><00:00:53.840><c> show</c><00:00:54.079><c> up</c>

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
of factors that lead to how you show up
 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.229 align:start position:0%
of factors that lead to how you show up
and<00:00:54.719><c> so</c><00:00:55.280><c> i</c><00:00:55.440><c> felt</c><00:00:55.600><c> like</c><00:00:55.760><c> i</c><00:00:55.840><c> wanted</c><00:00:56.000><c> to</c><00:00:56.079><c> write</c>

different way let me know if this makes
 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.430 align:start position:0%
different way let me know if this makes

you give yourself just like you said and
 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.150 align:start position:0%
you give yourself just like you said and

then personality is the way that that

yeah there are constraints and we can
kind<00:05:30.960><c> of</c><00:05:31.199><c> go</c><00:05:31.360><c> back</c><00:05:31.520><c> and</c><00:05:31.680><c> forth</c><00:05:31.919><c> and</c><00:05:32.080><c> figure</c><00:05:32.320><c> out</c>

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
kind of go back and forth and figure out
 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.390 align:start position:0%
kind of go back and forth and figure out
what<00:05:32.880><c> we</c><00:05:33.039><c> both</c><00:05:33.199><c> think</c><00:05:33.360><c> about</c><00:05:33.600><c> that</c>

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
what we both think about that
 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.310 align:start position:0%
what we both think about that
but<00:05:34.560><c> yeah</c><00:05:34.800><c> as</c><00:05:34.880><c> far</c><00:05:35.039><c> as</c><00:05:35.120><c> my</c><00:05:35.280><c> own</c><00:05:35.440><c> story</c><00:05:36.160><c> i</c>

something that you initially wanted and
 

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
something that you initially wanted and

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
have greater empathy and compassion and
 

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
have greater empathy and compassion and
so<00:21:02.080><c> in</c><00:21:02.320><c> hearing</c><00:21:02.559><c> his</c><00:21:02.799><c> story</c><00:21:03.039><c> i'm</c><00:21:03.120><c> like</c><00:21:03.760><c> i</c><00:21:03.840><c> can</c>

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
so in hearing his story i'm like i can
 

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.669 align:start position:0%
so in hearing his story i'm like i can
kind<00:21:04.159><c> of</c><00:21:04.240><c> see</c><00:21:04.480><c> what</c><00:21:04.880><c> i</c><00:21:05.120><c> obviously</c><00:21:05.360><c> wouldn't</c>

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
kind of see what i obviously wouldn't
 

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
kind of see what i obviously wouldn't
justify<00:21:06.080><c> him</c><00:21:06.240><c> doing</c><00:21:06.400><c> it</c><00:21:06.480><c> but</c><00:21:06.559><c> i</c><00:21:06.640><c> can</c><00:21:06.799><c> see</c><00:21:07.280><c> to</c>

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
justify him doing it but i can see to
 

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.590 align:start position:0%
justify him doing it but i can see to
some<00:21:07.919><c> reason</c><00:21:08.159><c> why</c><00:21:08.400><c> he</c><00:21:08.559><c> did</c><00:21:08.799><c> that</c>

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
some reason why he did that
 

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
some reason why he did that
um<00:21:10.400><c> so</c><00:21:10.559><c> that's</c><00:21:10.720><c> that's</c><00:21:10.880><c> one</c><00:21:11.039><c> reason</c><00:21:11.280><c> why</c><00:21:11.440><c> the</c>

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's one reason why the
 

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.270 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's one reason why the
past<00:21:11.840><c> is</c><00:21:12.159><c> flexible</c><00:21:12.640><c> and</c><00:21:12.720><c> we</c><00:21:12.799><c> can</c><00:21:12.960><c> obviously</c><00:21:13.200><c> go</c>

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
past is flexible and we can obviously go
 

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
past is flexible and we can obviously go
into<00:21:13.440><c> the</c><00:21:13.520><c> mechanics</c><00:21:13.840><c> of</c><00:21:14.000><c> how</c><00:21:14.080><c> to</c><00:21:14.159><c> do</c><00:21:14.240><c> that</c><00:21:14.400><c> but</c>

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
into the mechanics of how to do that but
 

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.190 align:start position:0%
into the mechanics of how to do that but
the<00:21:14.559><c> second</c><00:21:14.880><c> reason</c><00:21:15.600><c> is</c><00:21:15.760><c> because</c><00:21:16.640><c> the</c><00:21:16.799><c> past</c>

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
the second reason is because the past
 

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
the second reason is because the past
isn't<00:21:17.360><c> what</c><00:21:17.600><c> ultimately</c><00:21:17.919><c> drives</c><00:21:18.240><c> you</c><00:21:18.320><c> it</c><00:21:18.400><c> is</c>

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
isn't what ultimately drives you it is
 

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.149 align:start position:0%
isn't what ultimately drives you it is
it<00:21:18.799><c> is</c><00:21:18.960><c> your</c><00:21:19.120><c> future</c><00:21:19.600><c> and</c><00:21:19.679><c> that's</c><00:21:19.919><c> really</c>

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
you at that next step which is obviously

super interesting question uh so just
 

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.310 align:start position:0%
super interesting question uh so just
for<00:31:49.120><c> like</c><00:31:49.279><c> the</c><00:31:49.519><c> theory</c><00:31:49.760><c> behind</c><00:31:50.080><c> it</c><00:31:50.240><c> the</c>

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
for like the theory behind it the
 

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.830 align:start position:0%
for like the theory behind it the
concept<00:31:50.799><c> is</c><00:31:50.880><c> called</c><00:31:51.039><c> the</c><00:31:51.120><c> self-expansion</c>

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's just learning to
 

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's just learning to
handle<00:38:18.800><c> that</c><00:38:19.040><c> learning</c><00:38:19.280><c> to</c><00:38:19.440><c> realize</c><00:38:19.839><c> that</c>

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
handle that learning to realize that
 

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
handle that learning to realize that
it's<00:38:20.079><c> not</c><00:38:20.240><c> gonna</c><00:38:20.480><c> all</c><00:38:20.640><c> fall</c><00:38:20.800><c> apart</c><00:38:21.520><c> and</c><00:38:21.760><c> and</c>

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna all fall apart and and
 

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.829 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna all fall apart and and
ultimately<00:38:22.480><c> becoming</c><00:38:22.880><c> comfortable</c><00:38:23.280><c> with</c><00:38:23.680><c> the</c>

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
try this trick
you<00:38:27.680><c> know</c><00:38:28.240><c> i</c><00:38:28.400><c> don't</c><00:38:28.480><c> know</c><00:38:28.640><c> what's</c><00:38:28.800><c> gonna</c>

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know what's gonna
 

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.310 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know what's gonna
happen<00:38:29.119><c> but</c><00:38:29.280><c> i'll</c><00:38:29.359><c> be</c><00:38:29.520><c> okay</c>

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
happen but i'll be okay
 

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.310 align:start position:0%
happen but i'll be okay
and<00:38:30.400><c> so</c><00:38:30.560><c> i</c><00:38:30.640><c> think</c><00:38:30.800><c> it's</c><00:38:30.960><c> mostly</c><00:38:31.440><c> about</c><00:38:32.000><c> it's</c><00:38:32.240><c> i</c>

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's mostly about it's i
 

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.910 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's mostly about it's i
mean<00:38:32.560><c> i</c><00:38:32.720><c> think</c><00:38:32.880><c> pain</c><00:38:33.119><c> tolerance</c><00:38:33.520><c> is</c><00:38:33.680><c> good</c><00:38:33.760><c> but</c>

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
mean i think pain tolerance is good but
 

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.109 align:start position:0%
mean i think pain tolerance is good but
i<00:38:34.000><c> think</c><00:38:34.079><c> mostly</c><00:38:34.400><c> it's</c><00:38:34.560><c> about</c><00:38:34.720><c> becoming</c>

00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%

and hours went by the truck was
 

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:41.750 align:start position:0%
and hours went by the truck was

getting<00:42:41.920><c> dark</c><00:42:42.240><c> getting</c><00:42:42.480><c> cold</c><00:42:42.880><c> i</c><00:42:43.040><c> think</c><00:42:43.200><c> that</c>

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
getting dark getting cold i think that
 

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.790 align:start position:0%
getting dark getting cold i think that
this<00:42:43.440><c> story</c><00:42:43.680><c> occurred</c><00:42:44.000><c> like</c><00:42:44.160><c> in</c><00:42:44.240><c> the</c><00:42:44.319><c> 70s</c><00:42:44.720><c> and</c>

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
this story occurred like in the 70s and
 

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
this story occurred like in the 70s and
so<00:42:44.960><c> this</c><00:42:45.040><c> was</c><00:42:45.200><c> like</c><00:42:45.280><c> before</c><00:42:45.599><c> cell</c><00:42:45.839><c> phones</c><00:42:46.079><c> and</c>

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
so this was like before cell phones and
 

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.349 align:start position:0%
so this was like before cell phones and
stuff<00:42:46.319><c> like</c><00:42:46.480><c> that</c><00:42:46.560><c> and</c><00:42:46.640><c> so</c><00:42:46.800><c> he</c><00:42:46.960><c> was</c><00:42:47.040><c> just</c><00:42:47.280><c> out</c>

00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and so he was just out
 

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:48.470 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and so he was just out
there<00:42:47.520><c> in</c><00:42:47.599><c> the</c><00:42:47.680><c> mountains</c><00:42:48.000><c> it</c><00:42:48.079><c> was</c><00:42:48.160><c> getting</c>

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
there in the mountains it was getting
 

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.349 align:start position:0%
there in the mountains it was getting
dark

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
dark
 

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.829 align:start position:0%
dark
and<00:42:49.440><c> so</c><00:42:49.680><c> he</c><00:42:49.839><c> got</c><00:42:50.000><c> in</c><00:42:50.160><c> his</c><00:42:50.319><c> car</c><00:42:51.040><c> turned</c><00:42:51.280><c> it</c><00:42:51.440><c> on</c>

00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
and so he got in his car turned it on
 

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
and so he got in his car turned it on
and<00:42:52.000><c> tried</c><00:42:52.160><c> to</c><00:42:52.319><c> pull</c><00:42:52.480><c> out</c><00:42:52.640><c> and</c><00:42:52.720><c> to</c><00:42:52.880><c> his</c><00:42:53.040><c> utter</c>

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
and tried to pull out and to his utter
 

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.550 align:start position:0%
and tried to pull out and to his utter
surprise<00:42:53.760><c> because</c><00:42:53.920><c> of</c><00:42:54.079><c> the</c><00:42:54.160><c> weight</c><00:42:54.400><c> of</c><00:42:54.480><c> the</c>

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
surprise because of the weight of the
 

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.230 align:start position:0%
surprise because of the weight of the
wood<00:42:54.800><c> he</c><00:42:54.960><c> was</c><00:42:55.119><c> able</c><00:42:55.200><c> to</c><00:42:55.280><c> get</c><00:42:55.440><c> traction</c><00:42:56.079><c> and</c>

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
wood he was able to get traction and
 

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.589 align:start position:0%
wood he was able to get traction and
pull<00:42:56.400><c> himself</c><00:42:56.800><c> out</c><00:42:57.359><c> and</c><00:42:58.160><c> and</c><00:42:58.319><c> so</c><00:42:58.880><c> bednar's</c>

00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
pull himself out and and so bednar's
 

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:01.349 align:start position:0%
pull himself out and and so bednar's
explanation<00:43:00.240><c> is</c><00:43:00.400><c> is</c><00:43:00.480><c> that</c><00:43:00.640><c> he</c><00:43:00.800><c> needed</c><00:43:01.119><c> that</c>

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
explanation is is that he needed that
 

00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:03.349 align:start position:0%
explanation is is that he needed that
load<00:43:01.599><c> he</c><00:43:01.680><c> needed</c><00:43:02.000><c> the</c><00:43:02.160><c> weight</c><00:43:02.720><c> to</c><00:43:02.880><c> ultimately</c>

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
load he needed the weight to ultimately
 

00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
load he needed the weight to ultimately
give<00:43:03.440><c> him</c><00:43:03.599><c> the</c><00:43:03.680><c> traction</c><00:43:04.000><c> to</c><00:43:04.079><c> move</c><00:43:04.240><c> forward</c>

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
give him the traction to move forward
 

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.430 align:start position:0%
give him the traction to move forward
without<00:43:04.720><c> that</c><00:43:04.880><c> weight</c><00:43:05.040><c> he</c><00:43:05.200><c> didn't</c><00:43:05.280><c> have</c>

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
without that weight he didn't have
 

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.349 align:start position:0%
without that weight he didn't have
traction<00:43:05.839><c> he</c><00:43:05.920><c> was</c><00:43:06.000><c> spinning</c><00:43:06.319><c> out</c><00:43:06.880><c> and</c><00:43:07.040><c> so</c><00:43:07.200><c> i've</c>

00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
traction he was spinning out and so i've
 

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:09.109 align:start position:0%
traction he was spinning out and so i've
kind<00:43:07.520><c> of</c><00:43:07.760><c> used</c><00:43:08.240><c> that</c>

00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
kind of used that
 

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.190 align:start position:0%
kind of used that
analogy<00:43:09.760><c> for</c><00:43:09.920><c> myself</c><00:43:10.400><c> like</c>

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
sudden we had these three kids and i
 

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.309 align:start position:0%
sudden we had these three kids and i
knew<00:43:38.400><c> that</c><00:43:38.560><c> my</c><00:43:38.720><c> time</c><00:43:38.880><c> was</c><00:43:39.040><c> going</c><00:43:39.200><c> to</c><00:43:39.280><c> zip</c><00:43:39.520><c> by</c>

00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:42.950 align:start position:0%
knew that my time was going to zip by
and<00:43:40.480><c> so</c><00:43:40.960><c> all</c><00:43:41.119><c> of</c><00:43:41.280><c> a</c><00:43:41.359><c> sudden</c><00:43:42.160><c> i</c><00:43:42.400><c> felt</c><00:43:42.720><c> this</c>

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
and so all of a sudden i felt this
 

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.430 align:start position:0%
and so all of a sudden i felt this
extreme<00:43:44.000><c> pressure</c><00:43:44.640><c> in</c><00:43:44.720><c> a</c><00:43:44.800><c> good</c><00:43:45.040><c> way</c><00:43:45.280><c> you</c><00:43:45.359><c> know</c>

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
extreme pressure in a good way you know
 

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
extreme pressure in a good way you know
it's<00:43:45.599><c> that</c><00:43:45.680><c> whole</c><00:43:45.920><c> pressure</c><00:43:46.240><c> can</c><00:43:46.720><c> either</c><00:43:47.040><c> make</c>

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's that whole pressure can either make
 

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.510 align:start position:0%
it's that whole pressure can either make
a<00:43:47.280><c> diamond</c><00:43:47.599><c> or</c><00:43:47.680><c> bust</c><00:43:47.920><c> a</c><00:43:48.079><c> pipe</c><00:43:48.400><c> but</c><00:43:48.960><c> i</c><00:43:49.119><c> felt</c><00:43:49.359><c> this</c>

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
extreme pressure that i needed to get
 

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.630 align:start position:0%
extreme pressure that i needed to get
moving<00:43:51.280><c> because</c><00:43:51.599><c> time</c><00:43:51.839><c> was</c><00:43:52.000><c> going</c><00:43:52.079><c> to</c><00:43:52.160><c> zip</c><00:43:52.400><c> by</c>
