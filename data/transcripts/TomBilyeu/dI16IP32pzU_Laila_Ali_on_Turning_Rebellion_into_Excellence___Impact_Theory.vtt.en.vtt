00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.430
Tom: Everybody, welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.280
You're here, my friends, because you believe
as I do that human potential is nearly limitless.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.809
You know that having potential is not the
same as actually doing something with it,

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.789
so out goal with this show and company is
to introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150
will help you actually execute on your dreams.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.449
All right.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.869
Today's guest is one of the most successful
female athletes of all time, but her road

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.540
to superstardom was a rocky one.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.640
Being born to a very famous father and having
a very difficult childhood turned her into

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.750
a self-proclaimed rebel without a cause who
lived like she was actively looking for trouble.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.420
Surprise, surprise, she ultimately found it.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.770
In this case, thank God, because it wasn't
until she was sent to juvenile hall for shoplifting

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.610
and spent months behind bars that she finally
realized that if she was going to make her

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.250
dreams a reality, she was going to have to
get herself together and get herself together,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.250
she did.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.199
After seeing her first female boxing match,
she realized in an instant that that was exactly

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.770
what she wanted to do.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.220
Despite all the naysayers in the world, she
decided to throw herself into boxing full-time,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.110
a decision that led to one of the most astonishing
careers in professional boxing regardless

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.360
of gender.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.280
By the time she retired, she had racked up
24 wins and 0 losses.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.430
She didn't just win, she dominated the sport,
getting 21 of her victories by knockout and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420
holding 4 world championship titles.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.780
She has so captured people's imaginations
that post-boxing, she has arguably been even

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.450
more successful.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.009
She's been tapped to host or appear on numerous
shows, including American Gladiators, Dancing

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.700
with the Stars, Celebrity Apprentice, Everyday
Health, and Late Night Chef Fight.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.590
She won Celebrity Chopped twice, impressing
my wife, and now she's set her sights on becoming

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.890
the queen of healthy living.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.280
She has an upcoming cookbook due out fall
of 2017 and she's launched her own lifestyle

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.289
brand and podcast, which is blowing up thanks
to her roughly 4,000,000 strong social following.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.140
Please, help me in welcoming the former President
of the Women's Sports Foundation, the daughter

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.260
of the greatest boxer of all time, the host
of Laila Ali Lifestyle, none other than Laila

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Ali.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(applause).

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Laila: Thank you.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.520
Tom: Thank you so much for coming on.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.150
Laila: Happy to be here.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.460
Thank you so much.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.460
Tom: Oh, man.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.750
Truly, truly a pleasure.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.750
Laila: Thank you.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.150
That was a great introduction.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Tom: Thank you.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.210
The funny thing is, I put more time and effort
into the intro, I think, than anything else.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.050
It's my way of coming to really understand
the person.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.700
The thing that surprised me, I didn't know
how rebellious you were.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.840
Laila: Yes.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.200
I think a lot of people still don't because
I wrote the book 'Reach!: Finding Strength,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.820
Spirit, and Personal Power' back in 2002 when
I first started my boxing career because so

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.910
many people were being naysayers.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.250
They didn't really understand where this fighter
came from.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.980
I'm like, "Look, you can't judge a book by
its cover.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.580
You never know what someone has been through."

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.650
They just assumed I'm Muhammad's daughter.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.030
I was like, "Oh, I want to be a boxer like
my dad" and that's why I became a boxer.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.880
Ironically, it had nothing to do with the
fact that my dad was a boxer.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.680
It was seeing women's boxing on television
for the first time.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.710
Tom: Yeah.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.600
I definitely made the assumption that you
had become a boxer and that your dad was coaching

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.240
you and that that was just a natural ascension
for you.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.080
How many ... there's eight kids in your family?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.440
Laila: I forget sometimes.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.130
Let me think, there's nine of us total.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.130
Tom: Wow.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.130
Laila: There's nine.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.130
Yes.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.560
I have one sister that I grew up with with
the same mother, so we have the same parents,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
both parents.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.030
Tom: But you're the only one that went into
boxing?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.080
Laila: Only one that went into boxing.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.950
I'm his youngest girl.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.910
Of course, that was something my dad had to
struggle with when he found out that I actually

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.069
wanted to enter the sport.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.640
Tom: Because he didn't want you to.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.640
Laila: No, he didn't.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.260
He didn't tell me not to when he found out.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.970
He pretty much heard through the grapevine.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.370
The story is basically as I wrote about in
the book.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.770
I got into a lot of trouble growing up.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.670
I was hanging out with the wrong crowd, I
had a really dysfunctional family.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.180
My parents divorced.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.210
My mom got remarried, she married a man who
was abusive.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.230
Not physically, but emotionally.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.320
She started putting that on us basically and
pretty much abandoned as her kids and we were

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.340
just raising ourselves.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.630
I literally lived in the guest house and nobody
woke me up to go to school, nobody made sure

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.270
that I had dinner, nobody did any of that.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.910
It was like you do your own thing, so I raised
myself.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.560
I was upset and I was feeling bad obviously
and angry at my mom.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.410
That coupled with the fact that I've always
been very independent and headstrong, it was

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.040
like, "I don't want people to like me because
my father's Muhammad Ali."

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.910
I would stray away from our group of friends,
our wealthy friends that we grew up with.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.130
Venture off into the wrong neighborhoods and
end up around people, "Hey, let's go shoplifting."

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.130
"Okay.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.370
I got money in my pocket, but I'm going to
go with you.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.590
Get it for free?

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.590
Sure."

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.800
Then you get in trouble and then that's how
that whole thing started.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.520
Once I got into the system, then they start
looking at your grades and they start looking

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.930
at like, "Where is your mom?

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.870
Does your mom know these friends you were
with?"

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.870
No.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.319
All these different things.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.930
The judge luckily just thought, "Okay, this
is Muhammad Ali's daughter and her mom doesn't

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.930
know what's going on.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.030
I'm going to teach her a lesson without actually
..." He never sentenced me to time.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.200
He basically postponed my case and said, "Go."

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.240
No, he said, "Come back in two weeks."

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.400
I thought my whole life was going to end.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.590
I went in there with this attitude like telling
my friends, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to court,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.590
girl.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.590
I'll see you at the club tonight."

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.590
I thought I was grown.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.780
They locked me up and that's when I became
a child like, "Mommy."

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.740
I'm looking at my mom and she couldn't do
anything.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.760
I got locked up and I hear now from her she
said, "Actually, it was the best thing that

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760
ever happened."

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.440
She felt like that's what I needed because
I was just doing my own thing and disrespecting

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.870
her, stealing her car, just doing what I wanted
to do.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.260
I came back two weeks later and that two weeks
seemed like months and months and months.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.460
I came back and he left me at the court in
the back room all day, didn't see my case,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.199
sent me back for another two weeks.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.860
I thought I was going to die.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.320
He did that a few more times and finally when
I came back, I was just ready to just, "Please

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.300
just get me out of here."

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.979
That's when they sent me to a group home.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.320
I was happy to go to a group home at that
point.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.360
Having your freedom taken away is unlike anything
else you can possibly imagine.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.830
I had to go to a group home and there was
a program there with other girls.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.520
We had to sit in group and we had to talk
about our problems.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.790
I've always been a planner.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.120
Even though I was going through, I had these
issues, there were positive things that I

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.120
was doing.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.940
I was really, once I set my mind to something,
I can do it.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.440
I said, "Now how long it's going to take to
get out of here?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440
What do I need to work on?"

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.440
I'm keeping notes.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.790
They're like, "It's going to take at least
a year."

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.100
I was like, "I'm not going to be here for
a year."

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.680
I had got out the program in six months, which
no one had ever graduated that program.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.020
By the time I was done, they wanted me to
come back and work there.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.020
Tom: Wow.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.020
Laila: Yeah.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.020
It was great.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.080
I learned so much about these young girls
that had problems way deeper than mine.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.930
It just showed me.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.449
That's when I really learned to stop complaining
and stop being mad about my situation.

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.830
I actually did have friends and family and
people around me that actually supported me

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.449
and loved me regardless of what was going
on at home.

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.050
It just really changed my outlook on life.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.680
I also wanted to grow up quickly, so that
was a thing about myself I wrote about in

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
the book.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.270
I went to school to learn how to do nails.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.380
I used to take the bus.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.479
I was doing really bad in school getting bad
grades, but then I'd take the bus way across

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.290
town into the hood to go to school to learn
how to do nails.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.240
I was like, "I'm going to move out this house."

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.300
I didn't like my home.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.440
I was like, "I want to move out this house
as soon as I can."

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.820
Tom: That was a promise you made your mom
at 13?

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.820
Laila: I did.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.820
Yeah.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.820
I asked her to emancipate me.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.509
I was like, "I found out you can emancipate
me.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.050
There's some kids that live on their own."

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.050
I did this research.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.840
She was like, "Laila ..." I was like, "No,
really."

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.700
That didn't work, so I was like, "Okay, as
soon as I'm old enough."

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.570
I said I'm going to go to school, I'm going
to live on my own, pay my bills.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.550
I was like, "How can I go to school and pay
my bills?

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.539
I have to be in control of my schedule."

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:06.590
I learned how to do nails.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.620
After I got out, it sounds crazy now saying
that after I was locked up, after I got back

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.990
on track, I went and started building a clientele
and had a nail salon.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.630
That's what I was doing when I saw women's
boxing for the first time.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:24.200
In school, had a nail salon which I built
up on my own at the age of 18, and then I

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.310
just went a different direction with boxing.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.509
I know that was a mouthful, but ...
Tom: No, no.

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:29.520
I want to belabor the point a little more.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.909
Every story that you touch on there, having
read the book, I know how deep to go.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:39.229
For instance, in trying to get your degree,
you end up losing 200 hours because of a clerical

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.229
error.

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.229
Laila: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.329
Tom: But you still had the fortitude to keep
taking the bus to get it done.

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:47.579
I'm going to guess, and we'll get more into
this later, but I'm going to guess that those

00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:49.949
laid some of the foundation for a champion's
mindset.

00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:50.949
Laila: Definitely.

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:52.980
Tom: How did you cultivate that, though?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.259
How did you not just get pissed off and quit
which is, I think, what 99% of people do when

00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:00.010
they realize, "Okay, I'm halfway there" and
"Nope, I'm back at zero"?

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.149
Laila: I think that ... and I never actually
thought about that.

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:08.850
I wrote the book so long ago, now that I'm
really grown and have my own kids and really

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.899
thought back to that situation, how at that
age did I say, "You know what?

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:14.899
I spent all this time."

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:17.999
It took a long time to get 200 hours and taking
the bus across town.

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:21.259
Trust me, nobody else in my family was taking
the RTD, okay?

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:22.259
I don't even know.

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:23.259
Is RTD even still around?

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:24.879
Is it called the RTD anymore?

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:27.110
I don't know, but that was public transportation.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.329
My sister would never get on the bus.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.269
She would wait for my mom to drive her somewhere.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:34.029
Remember, we lived in Malibu at a certain
point and all these beautiful places and I'm

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:35.879
Muhammad Ali's daughter on public transportation.

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.759
That should tell you something right there.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:38.759
I'm a little different.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:39.759
I didn't care.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:42.790
I was like, "I need to get where I need to
go and I'm not waiting on my mom to take me."

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.430
A lot of times, I would be let down.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.430
I'd be waiting.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.949
You say you're going to take me somewhere
and you don't.

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:50.410
I learned at a very young age like, "If you
want it, you got to go get it."

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:56.720
For me when I found out that those hours were
lost, because I wanted that license so badly,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.889
I was like, "I'm just going to have to do
it again.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:09:59.899
There's no other choice."

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.689
If you want it, you got to go get it.

00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:06.209
I went to a different school, started over,
and ended up at a better school with a better

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:07.410
situation.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.949
That's pretty much it.

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:13.209
We can get into that deeper, but in the moment,
I didn't think like, "Of course this is a

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:14.300
champion mindset."

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.510
It's just like, "I want something and I'm
not going to let any roadblock that gets in

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.510
the way stop me.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.829
I'm going to get there regardless."

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:20.829
Tom: Yeah.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:21.829
I love that.

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:25.209
The one thing that I wish for anybody watching
this, do yourself a favor.

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:28.491
Normally I wait til the end to encourage people
to really dive in, but I'm telling you this

00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:30.800
is how you want to research Laila Ali.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.980
Read her biography first.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.649
Now I had the great pleasure of not realizing
that it had been written back in 2002.

00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:37.649
Laila: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:41.899
Tom: When I'm reading it, I keep like, "When
is she going to start talking about boxing?",

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:47.779
which doesn't come until literally at the
last, maybe, eighth of the book or something.

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:48.899
I'm like, "Whoa."

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:50.100
I'm getting super deep.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.470
You'd opened up saying, "If I'm going to tell
you about me, I'm going to tell you about

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.470
me.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.649
No bullshit, no holds barred.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.070
We're going to really go in on this."

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.579
It was so raw, so vulnerable, so unguarded.

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:02.679
Okay, now I'm in that world.

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:04.249
You haven't even started talking about boxing
yet.

00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:07.639
I realize there's very little left in the
book to get into boxing and then I realize,

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.699
"Oh my God, this was written a long time ago."

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:13.220
Now I get to do this time warp.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.470
Literally I finish the book, I set it down,
and then I start watching videos where I filtered

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.839
by last year.

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:22.699
It was all stuff in the last ... most of it
was really three to six months, and you're

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:24.929
a totally different person.

00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:30.720
As unguarded as you were in the book, I could
still feel you doing, you were using the unguarded-ness

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.929
as a way to push people back to almost intimidate,
if that makes sense.

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:44.869
You were so strong and now there's this wonderful
openness about you.

00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:45.869
Was that intentional?

00:11:45.869 --> 00:11:47.250
Laila: I like the way you broke that down.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.620
Let me explain.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.689
You're really, really on it.

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:56.560
When I first started boxing, I felt like I
had something to prove.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.160
One, I had to let people really get to know
me, first of all.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.680
Even til this day, I don't like when people
attack my character.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.320
Character is really important to me and having
integrity.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.149
I remember when I first started boxing, people
were like, "Oh, it's a publicity stunt.

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:13.809
She's just doing it to get attention."

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:19.259
It was totally not the case and that irritated
me like, "Why would I do that?"

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:20.899
That's just not the type of person that I
am.

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:24.009
In fact, as I wrote in the book, I didn't
want to be famous.

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:27.049
That was part of why it took me so long, it
felt like so long.

00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:28.480
Now I look back, I was like, "That wasn't
that long."

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.749
It took me a year of contemplation to get
into it, but it felt like forever as a young

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:37.129
person to make a decision to do something.

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:40.230
I didn't want to be living my life publicly.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.839
That was a inner struggle and then once it
started happening, people were just like,

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:47.360
"Oh, things are going to be easier for her
because of who she is."

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.269
I had to show people I've been a fighter all
my life.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.339
I don't have any fear.

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.709
Since then in my career, I've had certain
people call me, say that I won't fight them

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:56.709
and I'm afraid.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:57.970
I've never been afraid of anybody.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.089
I wasn't afraid to stand up to my father when
I said, "I don't want to be Muslim."

00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:04.059
He [inaudible 00:13:02] I shouldn't box and
women shouldn't box.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.850
I said, "I don't care what you think.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.049
I'm going to do it anyway."

00:13:07.049 --> 00:13:09.829
It wasn't even about proving anything to him.

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:12.869
It was just a matter of I'm going to do it
regardless and it really didn't matter to

00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:13.869
me what he thought.

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:15.999
I didn't go to him to ask him for help.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:19.199
The thing is that even though that's my dad
... and my dad didn't raise me.

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:23.449
My dad wasn't there for the most important
parts of my life.

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:28.550
It's hard to be fighting the world and be
as great as he is and be a present dad.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.329
I'm not faulting him for that, but that's
just the truth.

00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:35.660
A lot of what I had to go through when I was
... went through molestation by family, he

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.470
didn't know about any of that.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.939
Part of it, I can't say that it's his fault,
but a lot of things, you just ... he was getting

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:43.449
sick and he had a lot going on.

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:45.860
You don't want to bother your father with
that.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:51.470
These are things that I had to deal with,
but as a child, you feel abandoned by both

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.470
parents.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.929
That's something that I had to deal with,
but I found a way to become strong.

00:13:56.929 --> 00:13:59.399
I did my fighting and I let my anger out in
the ring.

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:03.049
These girls had no idea what I was unleashing
on them, you know what I mean, and where.

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:04.049
They had no idea.

00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:08.389
Before I'd get into that ring, I used to look
myself in the eye and say, "Okay, you're about

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.389
to do this."

00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:10.829
I would look deep within.

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:15.459
There was no doubt in my mind that I wasn't
going to win that fight because I was bringing

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.929
all this stuff to the ring.

00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:20.829
Like I said, we can get into that, but I don't
even remember what the question was.

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:21.959
I just went all off.

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:23.389
Tom: You answered it, nonetheless.

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:25.490
That was amazing.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:31.819
What I was saying was that you are, to me,
this watchable transformation.

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:35.089
So often a transformation is told looking
backwards.

00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:36.089
Laila: Right.

00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:42.160
Tom: Because you've been living a relatively
public life since you were about 18, you can

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.319
follow that.

00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:50.019
It's so powerful and I really encourage certainly
young women to read the book to understand-

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.019
Laila: That's who I wrote it for, really.

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:56.199
Tom: Which is incredible because I think if
they really do that and they take the time,

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:58.209
there's a couple things I want them to take
away from.

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:03.190
One, that you were super open and yet still
a confident, secure person who's gone on to

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:08.299
be very successful, and most importantly,
Laila, this is the thing that freaks me out

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.989
about you in the most beautiful way possible.

00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:11.989
You're not bitter.

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:12.989
Laila: Mm-mmm (negative).

00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:16.999
Tom: Even in the book and you're, I have the
chills, you're detailing what you went through

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.180
with your mom, your father moves to Michigan,
very much not a part of your life.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:26.529
You don't feel protected, you were molested,
bad relationships, just negative things happening

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:27.600
to you.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.689
Yet through it all, you're like, "I don't
judge my mom and I have real love and warmth

00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:31.689
for her.

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:33.999
I'm, in many ways, a mother's girl."

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.740
It seems like you guys have rekindled the
relationship.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.399
The whole time I'm reading it, I'm like, "How
is she not just pissed all the time?"

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:42.949
Laila: I did go through my time when I was
angry because I was in it.

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:46.350
When I moved out of the household, I was able.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.249
My mom is a great person.

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:53.109
She's a beautiful person inside and out, but
I see her weakness as a woman.

00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:54.180
She knows that.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.360
Trust me, that was hard to write that book
because I do love my mom and I'm putting her

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360
business out there, too.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.129
I'm putting my dad's business out there.

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.429
I didn't make a lot of money on that book.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.069
It wasn't for money; that was never the purpose.

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:08.799
It was just something that I needed to release
and it really was about me at the time.

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:11.649
It was more selfish like, "People need to
understand me.

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:14.649
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to tell your
story too because that's a part of my story."

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:17.439
My mom was not happy about that book because
she was ashamed.

00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:20.180
I said, "This is going to help."

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.230
This is a young girl telling her mom, "Mom,
this is going to help more people than it's

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.230
going to hurt.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.889
I'm sorry, but you made your bed, you got
to lay in it."

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:30.269
I've said that to my dad over the years too
about certain things.

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:31.619
That's just how I feel.

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:35.589
I take responsibility for the things that
I do, so that's for everybody.

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:40.110
That's sad, but you did do that and you did
make those choices.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:46.429
For me, like I said, it wasn't a easy thing
to do also as far as my mom was concerned,

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:48.629
but I thought that it was so important for
people.

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:54.350
Even now like you said, I can reverse engineer
and go back and look at ... It was great.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.919
Like I said, I republished the book and I
had to read it again because I was afraid

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:59.499
it was weird as an adult to open it.

00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:03.239
Not because I don't know the story, just because
I don't like watching myself on TV.

00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:06.880
I don't like listening to myself and I didn't
want to read my book.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.740
When I went back in, I had to update it and
do certain things to it.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.049
I was like, "Wow."

00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:17.329
Now as a mom and just really looking at things
differently like having your daughter write

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:22.020
the things that I wrote even though they were
true, you see things from a different perspective.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.670
It's amazing to be able to go back and see.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.530
I have always been that same real person.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.160
One thing about me is I'm honest.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.300
I put it out there and it is what it is.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.630
At the same time, I have integrity, of course.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.020
I'm not going to just throw people under the
bus, but I have to tell the story.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.490
Tom: It definitely felt like it was done in
a respectful way.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.700
It's like violence or nudity in a film.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.640
There's gratuitous and then there's, okay,
it's meaningful to the experience.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.740
It felt like a gift.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.240
It felt like a real glimpse.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.090
You can tell people all day long, "Money is
not the answer."

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.090
Laila: Of course.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.030
Tom: People just, they don't believe it.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.170
Reading that book was like, "Wow, it really
wasn't a solution."

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.430
It doesn't get more famous than your dad,
not on a worldwide stage.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.640
There's precious few people that have had
the kind of global impact that your father

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.030
has.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:21.390
Growing up on that stage with that kind of
wealth and to see that that wasn't the answer,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.960
that you still had to find your own path,
but that you did carve that path.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.210
I want to talk about what you just brought
up, which is responsibility.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.820
Taking responsibility for what you do.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.100
Above my fireplace, which you can't see, is
the infamous image of Jordan from the flu

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:42.390
game where he's, head bowed down and has one
of the best games of the playoffs all while

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.080
having a 102, 103 degree temperature.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.180
You boxed one of your most famous fights with
the flu, but then you never talked about it

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.430
until years later.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.430
Laila: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.430
Tom: Why didn't you talk about it?

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.350
Laila: For me, I'm really a true competitor.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.160
I'm not going to make any excuses, period,
for my performance.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.890
My performance was not up to par, to me, because
I wanted a knockout and I didn't get it.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.970
To me, to say "Oh, I had the flu" and it was
really no way to prove it, it would have seemed

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.980
like I was just making up an excuse when I
didn't need to make up an excuse because I

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
beat that ass.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:21.070
I beat that ass now, don't get it twisted,
and I won fair and square.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.280
I don't need to come back now and make an
excuse.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.640
The fact is I did have the flu and after the
third round, I was ready ... I would not sit

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.650
down in my corner because if I sit down, I'm
not going to be able to get back up.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.850
I remember and this, we're talking about the
fight with Jackie Frazier, which is Joe Frazier's

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.110
daughter, and there was a lot of history there
between our parents.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.890
I did not take her seriously.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.560
There's a whole story there, you'd have to
read the book, but I was just like, "I cannot

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.650
wait to just get her out of my way, dust her
off, and go for these championship titles."

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:54.090
She started boxing after I started boxing
and I had animosity towards her.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.390
I was like, "People already don't take me
seriously and here you come with the circus

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.390
act.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.640
You're not serious.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.240
You're just trying to make money and capitalize
on our names."

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.791
That's how I felt, but because people wanted
to see the fight and it made sense and it

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.390
was business, I was like, "Okay, I'm going
to do it."

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.870
I wasn't really interested in fighting her,
but I needed to at the time.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.350
That's actually, it was a tough fight because
I ended up being sick.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.420
I think it would have been tougher than I
thought anyway because she really wanted to

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.910
win badly, too.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.530
She really had animosity towards me.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.760
I didn't realize that she was bringing all
this anger into the ring from what she went

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.910
through on the other side with her father.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.550
My father used to talk about her father publicly.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.750
"He's a gorilla, he's ignorant", he's this,
he's that.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.660
She had to listen to that about one of the
most handsome, famous, most looked up to men

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.800
in the world talking badly about her father.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.160
She had a lot of energy, too.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.070
I'd be in my corner and they'd be like, "Get
her, Laila."

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.670
I'd be in her corner and they were like, "Get
her, Jackie."

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.110
There was so much energy in that room.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.290
I was ready to fall out, but there was no
way I was going to stop.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.800
I had no power in my punches, so I couldn't
get her out of there.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.500
I won the fight and then I regret that we
didn't have a rematch because I was young

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.540
and had so much to prove.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.540
I was like, "I'm not fighting her again.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.540
I'm not fighting her again."

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:16.880
That's one of my two regrets in life is not
having a rematch with Jackie Frazier.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.480
Tom: Are you going to tell us the other one?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480
Laila: At some point.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480
(laughter).

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.510
Tom: Fair enough.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.150
Laila: If it comes up.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.150
No.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.150
Tom: Walk me through.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.110
What does your self-talk sound like at that
moment?

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.570
Self-talk leading into the ring I know is
one of your things, I definitely hear about

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.050
that as well, but you're in the ring, you're
exhausted.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.260
You can hardly stand up, you know better than
to sit down.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.290
What are you saying to yourself?

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:46.030
Laila: Any time I've been sick, I always would
visualize the end of the fight, winning, and

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.950
as if it had already happened.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.670
That's kind of how I do now.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.510
I have this coach in my own head.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.490
When things get hard, I just remind myself
this is life.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.490
Things are going to get hard.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.490
This is just life.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.850
Don't worry about it, it's just, this is the
norm.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.680
It's almost like with kids.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.860
You stay calm and your kids'll stay calm.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.590
I keep myself calm that way like, "It's all
good.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.150
This is not a big deal."

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.150
I just stay calm.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.150
You know how it is.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.700
You can get yourself riled up and I try not
to get ... Sometimes you fall off.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.700
I'm not perfect.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.820
I'm saying this is 85% of the time.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.110
Sometimes I need to let myself get riled up
and then I calm back down.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:27.110
Tom: Walk me through when you decided that
you were going to be a fighter literally in

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.710
the room when you see female boxing for the
first time.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.010
You didn't even know it existed, which I had
to admit was pretty ironic that the daughter

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.790
of Muhammad Ali didn't know female boxing-
Laila: Right, but that tells you though that

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.910
women's boxing was not promoted.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.910
It was not publicized.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:39.910
Yeah.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.310
Tom: You were at a friend's house, if I'm
not mistaken.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.790
Her father says, "You don't want to do that.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.930
They'll knock your head off."

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:45.930
Laila: Right.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.930
Tom: How do you ignore everybody and still
decide like, "No, no, no.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.930
I'm going to do this"?

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.820
Laila: He was just a little na�ve to the
fact that I was a fighter.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.330
My friend knew.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.920
Remember, I was a little ...
Tom: In real life-

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.920
Laila: In real life.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.940
I was a little rough to begin with.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.450
I had had my fights.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:10.360
Anyone who knew me wouldn't be like, "Oh my
God, you're going to fight?"

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.360
I was always a fighter.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.260
Just to clarify, I used to call myself the
good bully because I'm that person.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.940
I still am.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.340
If I see someone picking on somebody, I'm
going to say something even now.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.900
I don't care if I'm in Starbucks in line or
somewhere and somebody ... I'll be like, "Excuse

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.020
me, no, no, no.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.380
There's no need to talk to her that way."

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.380
I'm that person.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.560
I'm going to get in it.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.210
I don't like to see people taken advantage
of.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:37.580
I'm talking about when it's someone that can't
stand up for themself or someone that's smaller.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.920
I would get into fights with boys a lot of
times because they'd be picking on someone

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.230
and I would jump in it.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.830
I've got into fights because people would
come at me wrong and I was the type that's

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.830
going to stand up for myself.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.480
Sometimes it could get physical, so for me,
I'm just not afraid of confrontation.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:58.220
I don't like to start it, but it excites me
and I'm totally comfortable with it.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.480
When he said, I was like, "What are you talking
about?"

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.940
I really felt like, "No, I can do this" not
knowing all the skill that went into it.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.130
I just naturally felt like, "No, I can get
those girls."

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.590
Now if I would have got in with those girls,
I probably would have ... I mean, I was bigger

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.160
than them, so we wouldn't have been in the
same weight class.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.100
I know now that you can't be a street fighter
and get into the ring with a professional

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.990
fighter and think you're going to win.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.120
That's just ... you can't.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.800
At the time not knowing, I thought I could
do it and he didn't.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.670
It was easy for me to be like, "Anyway, yes,
I can."

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:33.670
Of course once I thought about it and took
the time to actually contemplate going to

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.820
the gym, got a trainer, I said, "Well, let
me just see if it's going to come to me naturally,

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.820
the skill side of it.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.760
I don't want to embarrass myself, I don't
want to embarrass my father.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.170
I understand the responsibility that I have
just coming from, it's not just about me."

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:51.130
It never has been when it came to, even though
I'm going to do me, it's a fine line.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.850
It's not just about me.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.210
If I'm going to do this, I have to make sure
I do it right.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.770
When I went to the gym, I started training
and I'm asking the trainer like, "Do I have

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.770
it?

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.770
Is it natural?"

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.770
He's like, "Yeah."

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:03.770
Of course he's going to say yeah.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.770
He's thinking like, "Payday for me."

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.400
I wasn't with the right guy at first.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.460
He was not the right trainer.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.430
That's why it was easy for me to shut out
the naysayer in the beginning and not say,

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.430
"Oh, you're right.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.430
I can't do it."

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.430
I was like, "Yes, I can.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:18.450
Yeah, and I'm going to show you, too."

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.450
Tom: I was going to say.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.860
You've always said don't tell you that you
can't do something.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.450
Laila: Yeah.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.730
I sometimes tell me that I can't do something.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.730
Tom: Do you, really?

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.730
Laila: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.730
Yeah, definitely.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.730
Tom: How do you respond?

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:35.720
Laila: I'm not somebody who just thinks superficially
like, "I can just do anything."

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.710
Yeah, I can do anything, but can you be good
at anything.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.160
I'm not one of those people who wants to be
mediocre.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.970
It's something like, for example, I can sing
a little bit.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.400
I always say a little bit because that's a
disclaimer.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.190
Just in case you say I can't sing.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.770
That just makes me feel good to let you know
I know I'm not Whitney Houston, but I can

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:51.770
sing.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:57.300
I can't sing as well as I want to sing so
that's why I didn't ... For a little while,

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.770
I started singing, I started recording music,
but then I was like, "If I want to do it,

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.800
I want to be one of the best.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.530
I want to be like it's a gift."

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.520
I have a thing about people trying to do things
that they're not really good at.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.900
I have so many other things that I'm good
at, let me not fool around with this.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.650
You have to pick and choose, but that's just
the way that I think.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.370
I'm like, "I can do anything that I want to
do" is about what am I going to put my time

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.570
into doing and I want to do it well.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:26.240
I see kids, let's take for example a kid that
wants to play sports.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.500
Yes, you can try as hard as you can and you
can train.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.240
You can have the mindset and surround yourself
with the right people, but some kids just

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.240
don't have it.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.330
They just don't have that natural ability.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:42.220
Yes, you can keep trying and you can work
hard and out-hustle other people, but for

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:48.280
me, I'm the type of person I'd rather do something
else if it's not natural and something that

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280
I want to do.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.230
That's just how I go about things.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:57.900
Yes, I do tell myself sometimes like, "Maybe
you shouldn't do that" or "You can't do that".

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.450
I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:00.590
Tom: You're explaining it very well.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.590
Laila: Okay.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.590
Tom: I'm going to push you a little bit.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.650
Laila: Okay.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:08.610
Tom: Certainly from where you started back
as a teenager in your early career as a boxer,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:14.100
you didn't want to be out front, you didn't
want to live in the public eye and yet now

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.550
you have planted yourself very firmly in the
public eye.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.950
I was shocked at how good you are at speaking.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.950
Shocked.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.860
Remember, I'm reading the book thinking this
is happening right now.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.860
Laila: Right.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.520
Tom: It's like, "I don't want to be out front."

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.670
There's definitely a certain sense of being
guarded.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:34.630
Then in an instant, finish the last page,
click a YouTube video, you're like hella eloquent.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.420
I was like, "What just happened?"

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.420
(laughter).

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.010
I was like, you're able to be so gregarious.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:45.280
At some point that even though it wasn't an,
what I call, early wins, what you're calling

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.940
being naturally gifted at, for me, being verbal
was an early win.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.580
I won't say I was naturally gifted at it,
but hey, as a clumsy kid, maybe I was a little

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.550
less clumsy than other people, which made
me excited, which made me want to do it more,

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.820
and then I just put the hours in.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.840
At some point, like I get it with the boxing.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.450
I guess it's easy to imagine because of your
dad, but the personality shift of blossoming

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.760
and literally stepping out front.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.260
You did a 40 minute podcast, your first podcast
which was great, by the way.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.470
Laila: Thank you.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.660
Tom: That's what I do.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.700
Watching that, I was like, "You go, girl."

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.920
I was super impressed.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:27.270
When did that become, like despite not having
early wins, that you stuck with it, you got

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.330
good at it, and now clearly anyone who gets
introduced to you today just assumes you're

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.630
naturally gifted at speaking?

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:39.540
Laila: I've always been able to articulate
how I feel.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:47.170
I've kind of, over the years, understood the
importance of the platform that I have and

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.170
the difference that I can make in the world.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.340
Obviously growing up Muhammad Ali's daughter,
I've been inspired by my father in a lot of

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.950
ways to give back.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.850
That's ultimately what helped me make the
decision to box.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:03.430
I had to not be selfish because my reasons
for not wanting to be public [inaudible 00:29:01]

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:04.850
I was like, "I don't want to be bothered."

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.850
Then I was like, "You know what?

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:06.850
I can."

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.710
I don't want to be that Hollywood-type person.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.710
I'm still not now.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.010
I'm kind of anti-celebrity.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.780
I don't have celebrity friends and all that
because all that comes with that, I'm not

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.570
really comfortable with.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.060
I think that over the years ... and I'm still
perfecting that.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.120
I'm not to where I want to be, but I think
when you can be authentic and you can be unguarded

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.309
and you have a story to tell and then you
do it over and over and over again, you just

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:32.930
get better at it.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:39.870
I have a work ethic that I have really high
expectations of myself and I work hard.

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.809
That's something that I'm going to eventually
get good at it if I'm going to keep doing

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:45.670
it.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.490
Even with my fights, I didn't judge my fight
after I knocked somebody out and won.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.650
I didn't go, "Oh, look how great I did."

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.590
I'm watching the tape like "Let me see what
I can do better next time."

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.770
Of course I was going to win.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.770
That's not the point.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:55.770
(laughter).

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.960
No, really, this is just how I thought.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.520
It was, "I'm not surprised that I won."

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.700
People don't know what I trained.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.370
If you're a speaker, for example, I all the
time go, "You know what I mean?

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.450
You know what I'm saying?"

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.830
That's something that I do that is a bad habit.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.610
If I'm working on that, I'm like, "I'm going
to do this speech and I'm not going to say

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.550
that" and then I'm going to go back and check
to see if I say it.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.470
Other people may not have noticed, but I'm
going to see did I work on the things in the

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.550
gym that I was supposed to be working on.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.090
That's how you continually get better.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:27.710
I don't feel as successful as other people
think that I am because there's so many other

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.790
things that I want to do.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.720
When I saw it, I'm like, "Wow, it's great
to be invited on this show.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.500
I'm being seen as successful and I can inspire
other people."

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.190
I get it, but I still feel like I have so
much more to do.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.560
I think that that's what my drive is still.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.230
I see what I want and I'm trying to go in
that direction.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.270
To answer your question about speaking, I
think that it just happens over the years

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.270
and I do.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.270
I do speak a lot.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:58.190
I do a lot of public speaking and I'm perfecting
that craft, so thank you so much for noticing

00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.320
that I'm doing well.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.820
I'm learning from you here today by listening
to you and watching you interview me.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.340
Tom: Wow.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.150
If I can help you with something, I would
be elated.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.300
Laila: Oh, trust me, I'll be calling.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:16.730
Tom: My thing is the reason that I bring that
up is hiding in the way that you are or like

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.170
a road map of how to become great, literally.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.430
Even if I were just meeting you now and somebody
had given me these questions to ask and I

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:27.270
didn't know why I was asking and I just needed
to listen to the answer, you're revealing

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.580
it right here and now.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.220
MC Hammer, I met one of his backup dancers.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.110
His backup dancer said, "Let me tell you why
MC Hammer was great.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:42.600
After every single show, he would make us
watch the tape in real-time.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.890
We would get off the stage out of breath and
he would put the tape in of the show that

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.090
just happened."

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.010
He said, "He would make us watch it in real-time
and he would point out what worked, what didn't

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.340
work, what we could all do better."

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.950
He said, "I learned in that moment what real
greatness is."

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.470
Hearing you say that, that like, "Okay, I
just won but I'm going back to look at the

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.650
things that I did wrong", I really want people
to hear that.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:11.240
I don't want them to get lost in you saying,
"I had a natural talent for it and I worked

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.410
hard, yes, but it started from natural talent."

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.190
I want them to hear the "And I worked hard"
part.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.960
That, to me, is so critical.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.660
Right now, there's a young boy or a girl or
maybe an old man or woman and they've never

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.400
done that thing because they don't know what
they're naturally gifted at.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.150
They don't know where [inaudible 00:32:26]
their early wins.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:34.050
They think they have to in order to do something
great and I really believe your story is at

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:38.350
times that, but at other times is the watching
the tape.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.120
It is looking yourself in the eye before a
fight and saying, "I've trained harder for

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.590
this, I'm worthy of this victory, I've already
won."

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.590
Right?

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.360
Laila: Yeah, but the thing is is that, and
I've said to people before because they're

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.610
like, "You're so confident."

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.360
I'm not that confident about everything.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.240
I want people to understand that just because,
like when you start talking about boxing,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.660
you can tell I get a whole different energy.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.040
That's my thing, that's my space.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.220
Like, "Don't ... I'm going to take your head
off."

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.930
I used to have a thing saying like, "If my
mama got in that ring, I'd whoop her ass."

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.930
(laughter).

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.930
People are like, "Your mother?"

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.750
But if she got in there, that must mean she
was going to beat me.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:17.110
Like, "Okay, so if it comes down to me and
you, I have to win in this ring even if my

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.110
mother."

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.110
That was just a saying.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.110
I'm not going to really beat my mother up.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.630
Tom: Unless she got in the ring.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.090
Laila: Yeah, unless she got in the ring, but
she wouldn't.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.090
She knows better.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.090
(laughter).

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.090
I'm just being funny right now.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.870
I'm trying to be funny.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:33.270
I'm saying that I'm not that confident about
everything.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:39.150
I do have the confidence in knowing that if
I want to work hard at something, I can make

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.030
it happen.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.340
A lot of times, I know that people say like
when I say, "Oh, I have to work on this and

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.060
I have to work on that", people are like,
"No.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.320
Stop talking negative about yourself.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.320
I'm like, "I'm not talking negative, I'm just
being realistic."

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.820
People have a different way of describing
things.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.640
When I said to you, "Well, I say that to myself
you can't do something", sometimes I mean

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.380
"You can't do it yet" or "You're not there
yet".

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.500
In my mind, I'm not where I want to be, so
I'll say to myself ... like I've always said

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.320
I wish I had a better vocabulary.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:11.119
That's one of my things that I'm insecure
about because I did miss out on a lot of school.

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:15.099
I don't have the intellect as far as the books
and things that I would like to have or a

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:16.580
lot of the knowledge that I would like to
have.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.560
I'm always like, "Oh, in my next life, I'm
going to do better in school."

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.230
Some people are like, "Why can't you do it
now?"

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.470
I'm like, "Because I don't want to put my
time and energy into going back and doing

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:25.529
all these things now."

00:34:25.529 --> 00:34:29.009
A lot of time to myself, I'm like, "Well,
if you wanted to work on it, you could."

00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:31.739
That's always in the back of my mind like,
"Yeah, I could."

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:37.089
You have to choose because we have all these
things in life that we want to go after and

00:34:37.089 --> 00:34:42.079
it's like, "What are you really going to focus
on and hone in on to actually bring into reality?

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.139
This is only so much time and space."

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.139
That's how I feel.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.349
Tom: No, I'm with you.

00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:50.549
What are you going to do to make sure that
your kids have that kind of hunger and tenacity

00:34:50.549 --> 00:34:52.700
to see something through?

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.679
Laila: Not everybody has the same hunger and
tenacity.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.339
I know that.

00:34:58.339 --> 00:35:04.569
With my son, for example, he's very timid
and then I learned about he has a trait called

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:05.569
HSC.

00:35:05.569 --> 00:35:08.999
He's a highly sensitive child, but it's actually
a gift because he has heightened senses, sights,

00:35:08.999 --> 00:35:10.739
sounds-
Tom: Wait, did you actually have him tested

00:35:10.739 --> 00:35:11.739
for that?

00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:14.300
Laila: I found out about it myself because
he would say, "Mom, it's loud in here" when

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300
he was a kid.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.300
I'm like, "It's not loud.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.300
What are you talking about?"

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.810
If I changed the brand of ketchup, he said,
"I don't like this."

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.079
Like, "What are you talking about?

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:22.079
Just eat it."

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:24.020
He'd say, "My tag is hurting me.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.020
It's hurting me."

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.161
I'm like, "Curtis, come on.

00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:27.161
Your tag?"

00:35:27.161 --> 00:35:30.140
I looked and he had little scabs from his
tag.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.490
You know you can Google anything now.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.410
I got to HSC, highly sensitive child.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.480
You can answer these questions and then it'll
tell you whether you have one or not and then

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.269
just how to deal with it.

00:35:43.269 --> 00:35:45.650
I started to understand him more.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:53.630
With my son, he may not have that same drive
and type of attitude, tenacity that I have,

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.369
but he's very confident and he's a leader.

00:35:55.369 --> 00:35:57.289
He has it in different ways.

00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:00.849
My daughter, she's more like a little version
of me.

00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:01.849
I'm like, "Oh, man.

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:03.890
I got my hands full", but she's very sensitive.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.130
If you get on her, then she'll start crying.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.670
I think you really have to know your child,
but I just try to do, I'm like, "Well, what

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.670
did my parents do?"

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:17.190
I can tell you the things they didn't do right,
but what did they do right that made me feel

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.380
like I could just do anything?

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:25.279
Tom: I have a really distressing theory about
parenting kids in general.

00:36:25.279 --> 00:36:30.799
I think that hardship may be one of the most
important things if you're going to develop

00:36:30.799 --> 00:36:31.799
hunger.

00:36:31.799 --> 00:36:32.799
I come from the school of "Look, I get it.

00:36:32.799 --> 00:36:34.730
It's definitely nature and nurture; it's not
just one or the other."

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:41.849
I think that nurture probably accounts for
a lot more than nature by itself.

00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:46.489
There's a very distressing equation, we'll
call it, which is if you put somebody through

00:36:46.489 --> 00:36:50.480
tremendous hardship, most people will be broken
by that.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.410
The people that don't break become capable
of the extraordinary.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.950
Let's look at it from a bacteria perspective,
which I'm surprising myself with this right

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:00.950
now.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:06.630
If you take antibiotics and you stop before
your cycle is done or the cycle doesn't kill

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.960
them all, what you get left are the ones that
are still alive.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.960
They can face that adversity and they are
still tough.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.430
That's how you get superbugs because it's,
you didn't kill them all.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:21.550
It's like, either kill them all or don't treat
them and isolate and help proliferate the

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.039
ones that are the toughest.

00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:28.539
That's how I think about kids and that's how
I think about the inner cities specifically

00:37:28.539 --> 00:37:33.869
is you put a slew of humanity through the
inner cities and most of them are broken.

00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:39.380
Most of them fall into a generational cycle
of emotional and intellectual poverty, but

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:46.450
some become Jay-Z, some become titans of industry.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:50.890
You hear these crazy stories of people fleeing
Mexico with, like, $7 in their pocket.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:54.259
I met this guy once who's now, I forget the
name of the company, but this huge company

00:37:54.259 --> 00:38:00.369
in the U.S. He said, "I crossed the Mexico
American border with $7 and a guitar and now

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:04.040
I've built this", it was a technology company,
"I've built this massive empire."

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040
Laila: Amazing.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.299
Tom: People that have immigrant parents, it's
that same thing.

00:38:08.299 --> 00:38:13.150
The adversity does break a lot of people,
but it also ignites.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:18.450
Reading your story, it was like, man, I would
never have wished the adversity on you, but

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:23.130
it definitely seems like it played a part
in making you as hungry and driven and successful

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.130
as you are.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.460
Laila: Definitely, and I wouldn't change any
of it.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.329
That's why I wrote about it and I embrace
it because a lot of people would be embarrassed

00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:34.599
to talk about it.

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:37.780
I still cringe sometimes when I hear someone
say "For shoplifting?"

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.440
because it doesn't sound good.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.529
People, again, they don't realize I was a
kid and whatever, but then I feel more comfortable

00:38:42.529 --> 00:38:46.150
when I can tell the story or someone can read
the story.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.420
It definitely is what made me who I am, everything
that I go through.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.420
You talked about being bitter.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.420
I'm not bitter.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.930
I have a saying, "Don't get bitter, get better."

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.400
Tom: That's nice.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400
Laila: Yeah.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400
Everything happens for a reason.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.329
I truly believe that.

00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:06.009
My kids haven't gone through poverty or anything
like that, so I think that obviously everyone

00:39:06.009 --> 00:39:09.700
doesn't have to live that lifestyle to just
be like, "I got street cred.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.739
I made it happen."

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:12.490
Everybody's going to go through something
different.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.819
My husband Curtis Conway is an NFL player
and he grew up in the hood.

00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:20.800
He has a whole different story than mine,
but we connected because we had so much in

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.800
common.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.589
I've always noticed I get along really well
with people from the hood.

00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:31.099
Some of my best friends are straight-up sistas.

00:39:31.099 --> 00:39:36.510
That's who I relate to and it's because it's
that realness, it's that rawness and the struggle.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:41.950
I relate to the struggle and I relate to hard
work and I relate to authenticity.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.589
I think that it definitely, everything you've
been through is it does turn you into the

00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:46.819
person that you are.

00:39:46.819 --> 00:39:50.099
That's why I don't look at my story and complain.

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.191
I don't look at my story and think it's any
better or worse than anybody else's, but I

00:39:53.191 --> 00:39:55.009
own my story.

00:39:55.009 --> 00:40:00.369
I think that as I've gotten older, I've learned
to appreciate other people more.

00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:05.819
I used to put my dad on such a high pedestal
because of all of the great ... now, trust

00:40:05.819 --> 00:40:10.279
me, he's not perfect at all and I know all
the things about him that are not perfect.

00:40:10.279 --> 00:40:17.269
That also taught me a lot like you can be
that great and still not be ... far from it,

00:40:17.269 --> 00:40:21.039
really far from it, I'm saying as far as I
know some really great dads.

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:24.630
I'm saying just some of the things about my
dad, I'm like, "How do you do this and then

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.380
do that?"

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.589
We're complicated human beings.

00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:31.800
Every individual has their things, some that
you're good at, some that you're bad at.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:36.979
When you learn that at a very young age, you
just judge people in the world very differently.

00:40:36.979 --> 00:40:39.410
It's like, "We're all here for a reason.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.210
We're all a part of this universe.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.009
Everybody is just as important."

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:50.109
I am blessed to, from a very young age and
I get it, be confident.

00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:56.849
I try to use my platform to get other people
to see all the unique gifts that they have.

00:40:56.849 --> 00:40:59.240
Everybody's story is different and unique
and just as important.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.839
Tom: Tell us a bit about the platform that
you're building.

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:08.500
How do you hope that helps people be more
comfortable and confident?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:14.739
Laila: From a business standpoint when I retired
from boxing, it was like, "Now what am I going

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:15.739
to do?"

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:16.739
I've always been an entrepreneur.

00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:21.819
I've always felt like I can do a million things,
so it's really zoning in like, "What do I

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:22.930
really want to do?"

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.130
Yes, I did Dancing with the Stars because
I'd had to show people a different side of

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.480
myself and that was the perfect opportunity.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.990
From there, I went on to start hosting television
shows and all that.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.839
That wasn't the plan.

00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:38.220
I don't even remember what the exact plan
was then, but I knew I needed to show a different

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.239
side of myself.

00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:42.710
I hosted American Gladiators with Hulk Hogan
and a bunch of other shows.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:47.609
All that time though behind the scenes, I
was like, "What do I really want to do?"

00:41:47.609 --> 00:41:50.190
These shows come and go and now you're back
at the starting point.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.930
I don't like feeling like anyone's in control
of my destiny.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:58.229
It's like, "If you have to wait for someone
to give you a hosting job, that's not really

00:41:58.229 --> 00:42:00.140
being in control of the situation."

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.680
It took me about five years to say, "Hmm,
what am I passionate about?

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680
What do I love?

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.349
What can I have the same confidence and drive
for as I did boxing?"

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:12.710
That was when I really started learning that
health, fitness, and wellness was something

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.509
I was passionate about because I'm writing
nutrition plans for friends and always trying

00:42:16.509 --> 00:42:17.509
to help people.

00:42:17.509 --> 00:42:20.800
I'm doing it now because that's what I'm really
into, but I was like, "Okay."

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.489
Now business mind kicks in like, "How can
I monetize this?

00:42:24.489 --> 00:42:27.619
How can I really focus on the things that
I love?"

00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:31.039
Give back, do philanthropy, all of that, but
still make sure that I'm taking care of my

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:32.039
family.

00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:36.999
That's when I started the Laila Ali Lifestyle
brand and I'm still building it now.

00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:41.329
I have my podcast Laila Ali Lifestyle and
I have my blog which is under reconstruction

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:43.809
right now and then I want to come out with
nutrition products.

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:45.950
I'm coming out with my cookbook.

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:52.569
As a celebrity, you have to rebrand yourself
because people knew me as a boxer.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:56.819
Then of course, I went on Chopped because
that was, again, strategic not only because

00:42:56.819 --> 00:43:01.309
I love to cook, but I need to get into that
space and put that out there so people start

00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:04.220
seeing me that way.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.329
We have a big problem here in the United States
with obesity and diabetes and people just

00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:11.109
don't know how to eat, how to take care of
themselves.

00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:13.559
They're always being fed the wrong thing and
different information.

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:14.940
It's really overwhelming.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:21.710
I feel like we can take control of our health
by eating properly because a lot of the problems

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.910
that we have are from the lifestyle choices
and the food that we're eating.

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:27.310
Tom: When you say the problems, do you mean
physically?

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.310
Mentally?

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.310
Emotionally?

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.310
All of it?

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.310
Laila: I mean all of it.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.970
I believe that your food can be a medicine
or it could be your poison.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:40.229
I truly believe, like I said, just by taking
control of your nutrition and eating good

00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:46.181
quality food and having a healthy lifestyle
mentally, physically, spiritually, all of

00:43:46.181 --> 00:43:51.799
that comes into play holistically but it definitely,
food plays a big part of it.

00:43:51.799 --> 00:43:55.539
You can't always go that deep on people because
some people are just like, "What's organic?"

00:43:55.539 --> 00:43:56.539
Or "I'm healthy.

00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:57.539
I drink only clear soda."

00:43:57.539 --> 00:43:58.539
I'm like, "Really?"

00:43:58.539 --> 00:43:59.539
(laughter).

00:43:59.539 --> 00:44:02.000
I hear those things, I'm telling you, when
I'm speaking around the country to certain

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
people.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.319
I'm like, "Wow, people really don't know."

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:08.489
Some people you have to start, meet them where
they're at.

00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:15.160
I really want to speak to those people that
just don't really get it and try to ... that's

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.529
my passion to teach people how to take control
of their health.

00:44:19.529 --> 00:44:23.410
When I started boxing, I had to lose weight
to become a fighter.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.680
I had to learn how to eat and how to fuel
my body and then I was like, "Wow."

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:32.229
I noticed how good I felt and how my body
changed, how my thinking changed, how my energy

00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:33.229
changed.

00:44:33.229 --> 00:44:35.410
Just everything about me changed because of
the way that I ate.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:41.160
Tom: How much do you think body image plays
into confidence and the ability to chase your

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.160
dreams?

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.280
Laila: It's very important.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.249
At the end of the day I just always say, "Just
focus on your health first" and then naturally

00:44:48.249 --> 00:44:52.440
when you feel good and you look good, you're
going to feel better about yourself.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.250
It's really the health should be the first
key thing.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:00.000
For me, I'm not that vain to where I won't
eat.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.599
I have to think about, "That's not good for
me."

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:05.599
If it's just about gaining two pounds, I don't
care.

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:08.849
I have to think like, "That's poison" and
that'll make me not eat certain things, but

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:09.849
I still eat.

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:10.849
I have my cheat days.

00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:11.849
Tom: All right.

00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:17.710
If you were going to leave for your kids a
few rules, suggestions about how to build

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:21.240
a champion's mindset and then that was it,
they could never talk to you again, what would

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240
you leave them with?

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240
(laughter).

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.240
Yeah, we got to think hard.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.240
Laila: You're going to do that to me?

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.890
Tom: Got to make it hard.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.979
Laila: Oh my goodness.

00:45:29.979 --> 00:45:31.609
How to build a champion's mindset.

00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:34.650
Let's see, I'm just going to have to start
running things off.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.650
Tom: Let's do it.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:39.050
Laila: I don't know how many things I have,
but I'm just going to have to go for it.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:43.640
First thing is you have to say, "Okay, what
is it that's going to make me happy?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.280
What is it that I want?"

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.799
Then you have to map out a plan in order to
get there.

00:45:49.799 --> 00:45:51.710
You might have to enlist some help from other
people.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.330
You might not have all these answers for yourself.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.280
It will be too overwhelming to think you have
to do it alone, but that's the first thing

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.390
you got to do.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.499
You got to get that right team of people in
place that are going to help you along the

00:46:01.499 --> 00:46:06.099
way, know more than you know, be honest with
you so that you don't start thinking your

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:07.680
own shit doesn't stink.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.390
Then you have to be willing to do the hard
work that it takes and you have to go into

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:14.940
it knowing that there's going to be road bumps,
there's going to be challenges.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.049
That's just something you should expect so
when you see it, it's not going to throw you

00:46:18.049 --> 00:46:19.099
off.

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:23.350
You have to just have faith and then when
you have your moments of weakness, you have

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:27.140
to ... for me, for one, I believe in a higher
being.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.140
I believe in God.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:33.470
I'm a spiritual person, so I'll have those
talks and say, "Please give me the strength

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:34.470
to get through this.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.970
Give me the strength to be focused."

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.789
I really trust that that's going to come.

00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:42.529
I'll just ask for it and then next thing I
know, things just work out.

00:46:42.529 --> 00:46:48.529
I feel like that is something that I can always
lean on so no matter what's going on, I'm

00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:52.089
going to get through this.

00:46:52.089 --> 00:46:54.079
I think that's pretty much it.

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:58.950
There's a lot more that we can say obviously,
but that's really what it comes down to is

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.411
knowing that you have what it takes to make
it.

00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:06.329
It might not happen in the time that you want
it to happen, but it will happen.

00:47:06.329 --> 00:47:10.710
These are all things I think that people who
are successful have said before, so I'm not

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.499
really saying anything different.

00:47:12.499 --> 00:47:17.200
If I'm talking to a child, I would keep it
simple and put it like that.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.170
I would say write it down.

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.650
Write it down and sometimes you're going to
forget because you're going to get emotional

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.660
and if you're like me, you're going to maybe
have a bad memory and you might need to refer

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.660
to your notes.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.119
That's something that you have to do.

00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:31.930
You have to say it, you have to think it,
you have to write it, and you have to really

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:34.630
believe it in your heart no matter what it
is.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:38.490
Tom: How do you learn from your mistakes and
build from that?

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.609
The thing I think in the book that really
hit me the hardest was when you were in an

00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:43.940
abusive relationship.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:50.569
The guy choked you at one point to where you
were legitimately afraid for your life.

00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:53.219
How do you come back from that and have a
relationship again?

00:47:53.219 --> 00:47:55.670
How did you learn from that and what was the
process?

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.229
Laila: A relationship with someone else, you
mean?

00:47:57.229 --> 00:47:58.229
Tom: Yeah.

00:47:58.229 --> 00:47:59.229
Laila: Everyone has their things they have
to work on.

00:47:59.229 --> 00:48:03.569
I've never been that person that goes on to
the next person as if they were the last person.

00:48:03.569 --> 00:48:06.979
It was kind of like, "This is a clean slate."

00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:09.880
I remember that day because he chased after
me naked.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.579
I ran out of the house and he chased me.

00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:19.910
That was very traumatic, but I always look
at myself and I think like, "Why did I let

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:20.910
it get to that point?"

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:25.720
There was all kinds of red flags that were
there and so that's what I do.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.239
Again, I always look at the situation and
say, "Okay, we're not going to deal with somebody

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.239
like that again."

00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:31.239
Tom: Very smart.

00:48:31.239 --> 00:48:33.900
All right, before I ask you my last question,
where can these guys find you online?

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:40.799
Laila: I can be found on my Facebook page,
Laila Ali, Instagram, @thereallailaali.

00:48:40.799 --> 00:48:41.799
I have Twitter.

00:48:41.799 --> 00:48:42.799
I don't use it that much.

00:48:42.799 --> 00:48:44.290
I'm trying to get better with that, but I'm
@thereallailaali on Twitter.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:50.589
Then of course, Laila Ali Lifestyle is available
at Podcast One and also on iTunes.com.

00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:54.960
If you come, I want you to comment on my show,
rate my show because I like to know what people

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.960
think.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.960
I'm not at the level you're at.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.859
I'm just getting in there, I'm just getting
started.

00:48:58.859 --> 00:49:00.599
Tom: No, your stuff is amazing.

00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:01.599
Laila: Thank you.

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:02.599
Tom: Absolutely.

00:49:02.599 --> 00:49:03.599
Laila: I'm having a lot of fun.

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:04.890
I'm having a lot of fun doing it.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:05.950
Tom: That's cool.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.799
All right, what's the impact that you want
to have on the world?

00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:15.809
Laila: When it really comes down to it, you
want to just inspire others to be the best

00:49:15.809 --> 00:49:17.460
they can possibly be in life.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:23.380
I just believe that each of us individually
obviously created by God, He did not make

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.380
any mistake.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.670
Regardless of whether you believe in God or
not, you were created perfectly as you were

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:31.390
supposed to be.

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:38.029
This life is really about finding out what
that gift is, what we're here for.

00:49:38.029 --> 00:49:42.079
Not everyone is going to be Muhammad Ali and
as far as his impact that he had on the world.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:46.960
I see everyday heroes all the time that are
doing things in the community or sometimes

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.259
take two other kids into their household,
raising her sister's kids.

00:49:51.259 --> 00:49:55.369
You never know what you're putting in that
kid's heart and mind and he might turn out

00:49:55.369 --> 00:49:57.279
to be the next Muhammad Ali.

00:49:57.279 --> 00:50:04.650
Everybody has an important job to do and I
think that I just want everyone to, no matter

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:08.509
what it is that you're doing, take care with
it, nurture it.

00:50:08.509 --> 00:50:09.509
See the importance of it.

00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:11.779
I don't care if you're sweeping floors.

00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:17.529
It's just that you got to do your best at
everything that you're doing and realize that

00:50:17.529 --> 00:50:22.170
anything ... that you can contribute and on
all different sorts of levels.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.211
I'm not one of these people that's like, "I
want to do this or I want to do that."

00:50:26.211 --> 00:50:31.460
It's just that I know that there's something
special about me and I'm comfortable saying

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.550
that.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.499
That's really it.

00:50:34.499 --> 00:50:38.670
I might have a different answer for you 20
years from now, but that's really all that

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:39.670
I can say.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:45.369
My most important thing that I wake up and
go to bed thinking about is my children.

00:50:45.369 --> 00:50:50.259
I'm 100% responsible for them and even though
they came to this world through me, they don't

00:50:50.259 --> 00:50:52.440
belong to me.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.420
I really see that it's really important for
me to raise them a certain way so that they

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:02.950
can go on and make their impact on the world.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.630
Tom: Laila, thank you so much for joining
us.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.509
Laila: Thank you so much.

00:51:07.509 --> 00:51:08.509
Thank you.

00:51:08.509 --> 00:51:09.509
I appreciate it.

00:51:09.509 --> 00:51:10.509
Thank you.

00:51:10.509 --> 00:51:11.509
(applause).

00:51:11.509 --> 00:51:15.029
Tom: Guys, this is a universe I promise you
that you're going to want to dive into.

00:51:15.029 --> 00:51:20.039
It is human transformation at its absolute
finest of seeing somebody go from a spark

00:51:20.039 --> 00:51:24.730
of believing that they could be something
to actually following it through and recognizing

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:29.319
it doesn't matter where you start, it matters
what do you love enough to really fight for

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.099
it, to become, to put in the effort.

00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:34.319
It's that thing that really to the core of
your being you're willing to fight for, to

00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:35.319
become.

00:51:35.319 --> 00:51:40.380
On the other side of a lot of hard work is
the person that you can become.

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:45.329
Anybody whose mission is to help not only
themselves but other people realize their

00:51:45.329 --> 00:51:49.249
highest level of potential, to actually actuate
that, you know that I'm going to be into it

00:51:49.249 --> 00:51:51.160
and that is what you're going to see in spades.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.529
Everything that she's done really touches
on that.

00:51:53.529 --> 00:51:57.329
It's absolutely extraordinary, especially
to read her biography and realize.

00:51:57.329 --> 00:52:03.789
This to me is one of the most beautiful human
traits ever, to go into a relationship, get

00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:09.009
hurt, go into another relationship knowing
you're probably going to get hurt again, and

00:52:09.009 --> 00:52:12.259
still open yourself up and be vulnerable and
let somebody in.

00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:17.950
That to me is what it means to be human, to
allow yourself that vulnerability, to experience

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.710
love.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:24.900
She's tough as fucking nails and yet is still
a beautiful human being.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.619
It's incredible and that friction, that balance
is what I love.

00:52:29.619 --> 00:52:31.430
Come on, how can you not love this face?

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:33.349
But really, that thing to me, that is it.

00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:34.420
That's the juice.

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:39.420
Finding the ability to be hard and soft at
the same time, to fight for something and

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.019
still be a mother, to be nurturing and open.

00:52:43.019 --> 00:52:45.982
That is incredible, that is something that
I definitely want for myself, and I want it

00:52:45.982 --> 00:52:47.430
for you guys and you will find it.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.410
Dive into her world, you will see how to strike
that balance.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.410
