i was more resilient
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
i was more resilient
now<00:04:58.479><c> you</c><00:04:58.639><c> start</c><00:04:58.960><c> putting</c><00:04:59.520><c> the</c><00:04:59.759><c> pieces</c><00:05:00.240><c> that</c>

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
now you start putting the pieces that
 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
now you start putting the pieces that
are<00:05:00.560><c> necessary</c><00:05:01.759><c> to</c><00:05:02.000><c> win</c><00:05:02.400><c> over</c><00:05:03.199><c> and</c><00:05:03.440><c> over</c><00:05:04.160><c> and</c>

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
are necessary to win over and over and
 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.909 align:start position:0%
are necessary to win over and over and
over<00:05:04.800><c> again</c>

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
over again
 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.070 align:start position:0%

so<00:05:06.160><c> if</c><00:05:06.240><c> you</c><00:05:06.479><c> lose</c><00:05:06.960><c> and</c><00:05:07.120><c> you</c><00:05:07.280><c> jump</c><00:05:07.600><c> right</c><00:05:07.759><c> back</c>

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
so if you lose and you jump right back
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.469 align:start position:0%
so if you lose and you jump right back
up<00:05:08.240><c> and</c><00:05:08.400><c> you</c><00:05:08.560><c> haven't</c><00:05:08.880><c> really</c><00:05:09.360><c> changed</c>
