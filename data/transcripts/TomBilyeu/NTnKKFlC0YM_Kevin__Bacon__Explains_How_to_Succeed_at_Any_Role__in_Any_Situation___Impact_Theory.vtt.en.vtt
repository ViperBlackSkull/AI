get back together yeah yeah there's
 

00:41:53.369 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
get back together yeah yeah there's
what's<00:41:53.849><c> the</c><00:41:54.089><c> there's</c><00:41:54.630><c> been</c><00:41:54.690><c> a</c><00:41:55.070><c> protocol</c><00:41:56.070><c> that</c>

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
what's the there's been a protocol that
 

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.570 align:start position:0%
what's the there's been a protocol that
came<00:41:57.599><c> out</c><00:41:58.339><c> from</c><00:41:59.339><c> our</c><00:41:59.820><c> union</c><00:42:00.240><c> and</c><00:42:00.660><c> I</c><00:42:01.589><c> think</c><00:42:02.430><c> the</c>

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
came out from our union and I think the
 

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.060 align:start position:0%
came out from our union and I think the
general<00:42:03.530><c> idea</c><00:42:04.530><c> is</c><00:42:04.619><c> that</c><00:42:05.630><c> the</c><00:42:06.800><c> you</c><00:42:07.800><c> know</c><00:42:07.920><c> the</c>

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:08.070 align:start position:0%
general idea is that the you know the
 

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
general idea is that the you know the
more<00:42:08.250><c> testing</c><00:42:08.849><c> the</c><00:42:09.119><c> less</c><00:42:09.300><c> risk</c>

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:11.290 align:start position:0%
more testing the less risk
 

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:15.150 align:start position:0%
more testing the less risk
so<00:42:11.890><c> I</c><00:42:11.920><c> think</c><00:42:12.070><c> that's</c><00:42:12.430><c> gonna</c><00:42:12.640><c> be</c><00:42:13.920><c> you</c><00:42:14.920><c> know</c><00:42:14.980><c> it's</c>

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
so I think that's gonna be you know it's
 

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
so I think that's gonna be you know it's
good<00:42:15.310><c> I</c><00:42:15.610><c> don't</c><00:42:15.790><c> know</c><00:42:16.000><c> that</c><00:42:16.150><c> that</c><00:42:16.420><c> much</c><00:42:16.660><c> about</c>

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
good I don't know that that much about
 

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
good I don't know that that much about
how<00:42:17.170><c> many</c><00:42:17.350><c> tests</c><00:42:17.740><c> are</c><00:42:17.800><c> reveal</c><00:42:18.070><c> but</c><00:42:18.490><c> I'm</c>

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:18.670 align:start position:0%
how many tests are reveal but I'm
 

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
how many tests are reveal but I'm
guessing<00:42:18.880><c> that</c><00:42:19.090><c> there's</c><00:42:19.450><c> that'll</c><00:42:20.170><c> be</c><00:42:20.290><c> a</c><00:42:20.320><c> piece</c>

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:20.890 align:start position:0%
guessing that there's that'll be a piece
 

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
guessing that there's that'll be a piece
of<00:42:21.130><c> it</c><00:42:21.310><c> you</c><00:42:21.400><c> know</c><00:42:21.610><c> or</c><00:42:22.030><c> re</c><00:42:22.420><c> or</c><00:42:22.780><c> how</c><00:42:23.050><c> much</c><00:42:23.170><c> testing</c>

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:23.470 align:start position:0%
of it you know or re or how much testing
 

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
of it you know or re or how much testing
is<00:42:23.770><c> being</c><00:42:23.920><c> done</c><00:42:24.070><c> and</c><00:42:24.460><c> then</c><00:42:25.090><c> yeah</c><00:42:25.330><c> it's</c>

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:25.690 align:start position:0%
is being done and then yeah it's
 

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:30.510 align:start position:0%
is being done and then yeah it's
essentially<00:42:26.380><c> all</c><00:42:26.950><c> crews</c><00:42:27.310><c> is</c><00:42:29.160><c> the</c><00:42:30.160><c> crew</c><00:42:30.340><c> gets</c>

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
essentially all crews is the crew gets
 

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
essentially all crews is the crew gets
