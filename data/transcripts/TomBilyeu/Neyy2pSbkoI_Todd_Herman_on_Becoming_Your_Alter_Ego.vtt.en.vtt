you're gonna do on the test they'll do
worse<00:02:42.490><c> but</c><00:02:43.270><c> if</c><00:02:43.390><c> you</c><00:02:43.480><c> take</c><00:02:43.720><c> that</c><00:02:43.840><c> same</c><00:02:44.140><c> person</c>

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 align:start position:0%
worse but if you take that same person
 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.650 align:start position:0%
worse but if you take that same person
and<00:02:44.680><c> prime</c><00:02:45.280><c> them</c><00:02:45.550><c> oh</c><00:02:45.640><c> you're</c><00:02:45.910><c> Asian</c>

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 align:start position:0%
and prime them oh you're Asian
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
and prime them oh you're Asian
I<00:02:46.690><c> wonder</c><00:02:47.080><c> how</c><00:02:47.170><c> will</c><00:02:47.350><c> you</c><00:02:47.440><c> doing</c><00:02:47.650><c> the</c><00:02:47.740><c> test</c>

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 align:start position:0%
I wonder how will you doing the test
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.830 align:start position:0%
I wonder how will you doing the test
yeah<00:02:48.280><c> then</c><00:02:48.550><c> they'll</c><00:02:48.700><c> do</c><00:02:48.820><c> better</c><00:02:48.850><c> yeah</c><00:02:49.450><c> that</c><00:02:49.690><c> is</c>

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
yeah then they'll do better yeah that is
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
yeah then they'll do better yeah that is
so<00:02:50.050><c> crazy</c><00:02:50.260><c> to</c><00:02:50.500><c> me</c><00:02:50.530><c> yeah</c><00:02:50.920><c> and</c><00:02:51.070><c> when</c><00:02:51.490><c> I</c><00:02:51.520><c> was</c>

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 align:start position:0%
so crazy to me yeah and when I was
 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
so crazy to me yeah and when I was
diving<00:02:52.150><c> into</c><00:02:52.420><c> some</c><00:02:52.600><c> of</c><00:02:52.690><c> your</c><00:02:52.780><c> research</c><00:02:53.050><c> that</c>

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 align:start position:0%
diving into some of your research that
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.130 align:start position:0%
diving into some of your research that
was<00:02:53.950><c> what</c><00:02:54.400><c> I</c><00:02:54.430><c> was</c><00:02:54.580><c> thinking</c><00:02:54.880><c> is</c><00:02:55.030><c> like</c><00:02:55.180><c> that</c>

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 align:start position:0%
was what I was thinking is like that
 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.770 align:start position:0%
was what I was thinking is like that
there's<00:02:56.380><c> some</c><00:02:56.890><c> of</c><00:02:57.160><c> the</c><00:02:57.490><c> you're</c><00:02:58.330><c> taking</c>

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 align:start position:0%
there's some of the you're taking
 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.990 align:start position:0%
there's some of the you're taking
control<00:02:58.930><c> of</c><00:02:59.230><c> the</c><00:02:59.500><c> priming</c><00:03:00.160><c> essentially</c><00:03:00.700><c> yes</c>

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
control of the priming essentially yes
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.600 align:start position:0%

so<00:03:01.840><c> all</c><00:03:02.230><c> right</c><00:03:02.410><c> so</c><00:03:02.590><c> keep</c><00:03:02.800><c> going</c><00:03:02.830><c> understand</c><00:03:03.460><c> so</c>

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 align:start position:0%
so all right so keep going understand so

there's something about birthing it
 

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
there's something about birthing it
through<00:13:04.500><c> physicality</c><00:13:05.500><c> yes</c><00:13:05.800><c> that</c><00:13:06.220><c> and</c>

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.410 align:start position:0%
through physicality yes that and
 

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
through physicality yes that and
actually<00:13:08.410><c> be</c><00:13:08.620><c> really</c><00:13:09.010><c> curious</c><00:13:09.190><c> to</c><00:13:09.400><c> understand</c>

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:09.790 align:start position:0%
actually be really curious to understand
 

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
actually be really curious to understand
the<00:13:09.880><c> research</c><00:13:10.210><c> or</c><00:13:10.710><c> yeah</c><00:13:11.710><c> you</c><00:13:11.740><c> know</c><00:13:11.920><c> the</c><00:13:12.100><c> the</c>

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.310 align:start position:0%
the research or yeah you know the the
 

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
the research or yeah you know the the
underlying<00:13:12.760><c> physiological</c><00:13:13.330><c> thing</c><00:13:13.780><c> so</c><00:13:13.900><c> I</c><00:13:13.960><c> have</c>

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.110 align:start position:0%
underlying physiological thing so I have
 

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
underlying physiological thing so I have
this<00:13:14.200><c> obsession</c><00:13:14.650><c> with</c><00:13:15.420><c> physiological</c><00:13:16.420><c> hooks</c>

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:16.630 align:start position:0%
this obsession with physiological hooks
 

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.020 align:start position:0%
this obsession with physiological hooks
so<00:13:17.440><c> there</c><00:13:17.950><c> there</c><00:13:18.340><c> is</c><00:13:18.460><c> something</c><00:13:18.910><c> about</c>

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.030 align:start position:0%
so there there is something about
 

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.380 align:start position:0%
so there there is something about
your<00:13:20.390><c> mindset</c><00:13:21.110><c> to</c><00:13:21.610><c> physicality</c><00:13:22.610><c> sure</c><00:13:23.000><c> that</c><00:13:23.270><c> is</c>

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:23.390 align:start position:0%
your mindset to physicality sure that is
 

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.970 align:start position:0%
your mindset to physicality sure that is
