yeah he's good as people come isolde
smart<00:13:35.680><c> and</c><00:13:36.220><c> I</c><00:13:36.340><c> had</c><00:13:36.520><c> scar</c><00:13:36.760><c> tissue</c><00:13:37.000><c> that</c><00:13:37.120><c> somehow</c>

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:37.450 align:start position:0%
smart and I had scar tissue that somehow
 

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
smart and I had scar tissue that somehow
got<00:13:37.750><c> around</c><00:13:38.020><c> the</c><00:13:38.170><c> joint</c><00:13:38.440><c> and</c><00:13:38.680><c> so</c><00:13:38.830><c> every</c><00:13:39.040><c> time</c>

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:39.190 align:start position:0%
got around the joint and so every time
 

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.890 align:start position:0%
got around the joint and so every time
he'd<00:13:39.310><c> flex</c><00:13:39.550><c> muscles</c><00:13:40.030><c> and</c><00:13:40.360><c> the</c><00:13:40.450><c> biggest</c><00:13:40.750><c> ones</c>

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:40.900 align:start position:0%
he'd flex muscles and the biggest ones
 

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.230 align:start position:0%
he'd flex muscles and the biggest ones
in<00:13:41.020><c> your</c><00:13:41.140><c> body</c><00:13:41.290><c> it</c><00:13:42.250><c> would</c><00:13:42.520><c> pull</c><00:13:42.760><c> the</c><00:13:42.970><c> femur</c>

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
in your body it would pull the femur
 

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.170 align:start position:0%
in your body it would pull the femur
into<00:13:43.720><c> the</c><00:13:43.840><c> socket</c><00:13:44.350><c> and</c><00:13:45.010><c> it</c><00:13:45.370><c> would</c><00:13:45.490><c> grind</c><00:13:45.730><c> maybe</c>

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:46.180 align:start position:0%
into the socket and it would grind maybe
 

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.850 align:start position:0%
into the socket and it would grind maybe
20<00:13:46.600><c> times</c><00:13:46.780><c> a</c><00:13:46.930><c> day</c><00:13:46.960><c> turnover</c><00:13:47.620><c> when</c><00:13:47.740><c> you're</c>

wouldn't say in words because he cared
for<00:14:17.440><c> me</c><00:14:17.650><c> so</c><00:14:17.800><c> much</c><00:14:20.280><c> it</c><00:14:21.280><c> gave</c><00:14:21.460><c> me</c><00:14:21.550><c> this</c><00:14:21.640><c> little</c>

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:21.820 align:start position:0%
for me so much it gave me this little
 

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
for me so much it gave me this little
tool<00:14:22.120><c> basically</c><00:14:23.220><c> they</c><00:14:24.220><c> can't</c><00:14:24.430><c> cut</c><00:14:24.610><c> you</c><00:14:24.760><c> open</c>

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:24.790 align:start position:0%
tool basically they can't cut you open
 

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.370 align:start position:0%
tool basically they can't cut you open
because<00:14:25.360><c> there's</c><00:14:25.510><c> so</c><00:14:25.660><c> much</c><00:14:25.810><c> that</c><00:14:25.870><c> generates</c>

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:26.380 align:start position:0%
because there's so much that generates
 

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
because there's so much that generates
more<00:14:26.620><c> so</c><00:14:27.070><c> what</c><00:14:27.160><c> do</c><00:14:27.250><c> you</c><00:14:27.310><c> do</c><00:14:27.430><c> this</c><00:14:28.330><c> is</c><00:14:28.480><c> what</c>

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:28.630 align:start position:0%
more so what do you do this is what
 

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
more so what do you do this is what
retires<00:14:28.960><c> people</c><00:14:29.350><c> scar</c><00:14:29.530><c> tissue</c><00:14:29.740><c> and</c><00:14:30.390><c> you've</c>

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:31.390 align:start position:0%
retires people scar tissue and you've
 

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.490 align:start position:0%
retires people scar tissue and you've
got<00:14:31.540><c> to</c><00:14:31.690><c> the</c><00:14:31.780><c> point</c><00:14:31.810><c> what's</c><00:14:32.050><c> gonna</c><00:14:32.170><c> grind</c><00:14:32.320><c> off</c>

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:32.500 align:start position:0%
got to the point what's gonna grind off
 

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
got to the point what's gonna grind off
the<00:14:32.590><c> head</c><00:14:32.800><c> and</c><00:14:32.830><c> any</c><00:14:33.160><c> bones</c><00:14:33.400><c> grinding</c><00:14:33.910><c> it'll</c>

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.210 align:start position:0%
the head and any bones grinding it'll
 

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
the head and any bones grinding it'll
calcify<00:14:34.600><c> and</c><00:14:34.630><c> stick</c><00:14:34.960><c> right</c><00:14:35.170><c> so</c><00:14:36.070><c> that's</c><00:14:36.880><c> what</c>

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.090 align:start position:0%
calcify and stick right so that's what
 

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.430 align:start position:0%
calcify and stick right so that's what
was<00:14:37.210><c> happening</c><00:14:37.630><c> and</c><00:14:37.780><c> I</c><00:14:37.870><c> remember</c><00:14:38.200><c> when</c><00:14:38.350><c> it</c>

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
