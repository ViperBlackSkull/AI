00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:15.769 align:start position:0%

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:19.269 align:start position:0%
issue right now you know so there was a

00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:22.579 align:start position:0%
that that can do it so the hot star in
 

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:25.559 align:start position:0%
that that can do it so the hot star in

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:38.860 align:start position:0%
well the problem is now you're gonna
 

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
well the problem is now you're gonna

exacerbate all the other problems that

exacerbate all the other problems that

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
she has lower down in the line so
 

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
she has lower down in the line so
working<00:29:44.200><c> on</c><00:29:44.530><c> these</c><00:29:44.710><c> like</c><00:29:44.910><c> one</c><00:29:45.910><c> at</c><00:29:46.030><c> a</c><00:29:46.090><c> time</c>

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.270 align:start position:0%
working on these like one at a time
 

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
working on these like one at a time
right<00:29:46.480><c> okay</c><00:29:46.720><c> so</c><00:29:46.780><c> first</c><00:29:47.050><c> we</c><00:29:47.140><c> have</c><00:29:47.290><c> to</c><00:29:47.440><c> address</c>

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:47.710 align:start position:0%
