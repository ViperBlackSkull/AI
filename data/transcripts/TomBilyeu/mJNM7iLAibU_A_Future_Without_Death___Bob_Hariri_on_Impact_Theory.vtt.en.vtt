mind failing and and and owning up to it
so<00:30:08.020><c> I</c><00:30:08.470><c> think</c><00:30:08.950><c> for</c><00:30:09.309><c> me</c><00:30:09.490><c> the</c><00:30:10.090><c> ability</c><00:30:10.390><c> to</c><00:30:10.510><c> embrace</c>

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
so I think for me the ability to embrace
 

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
so I think for me the ability to embrace
failure<00:30:11.110><c> is</c><00:30:11.440><c> for</c><00:30:12.220><c> me</c><00:30:12.340><c> it's</c><00:30:12.490><c> a</c><00:30:12.580><c> strength</c><00:30:12.880><c> I</c>

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:13.090 align:start position:0%
failure is for me it's a strength I
 

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.669 align:start position:0%
failure is for me it's a strength I
think<00:30:13.620><c> and</c><00:30:14.820><c> but</c><00:30:15.820><c> I</c><00:30:15.850><c> but</c><00:30:16.179><c> I</c><00:30:16.210><c> I'm</c><00:30:16.900><c> not</c><00:30:17.140><c> a</c><00:30:17.200><c> quitter</c>

00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
think and but I but I I'm not a quitter
 

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:20.310 align:start position:0%
think and but I but I I'm not a quitter
and<00:30:17.890><c> so</c><00:30:18.520><c> if</c><00:30:18.610><c> you</c><00:30:18.700><c> have</c><00:30:18.820><c> the</c><00:30:18.940><c> to</c><00:30:19.150><c> not</c><00:30:19.900><c> afraid</c><00:30:20.200><c> to</c>

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
and so if you have the to not afraid to
 

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.350 align:start position:0%
and so if you have the to not afraid to
fail<00:30:20.530><c> and</c><00:30:20.860><c> but</c><00:30:21.580><c> you</c><00:30:21.669><c> don't</c><00:30:21.820><c> quit</c><00:30:22.059><c> when</c><00:30:22.240><c> you</c>

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
fail and but you don't quit when you
 

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.970 align:start position:0%
fail and but you don't quit when you
fail<00:30:22.600><c> I</c><00:30:22.840><c> think</c><00:30:23.320><c> that's</c><00:30:23.470><c> a</c><00:30:23.559><c> pretty</c><00:30:23.740><c> decent</c>

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:23.980 align:start position:0%
fail I think that's a pretty decent
 

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.529 align:start position:0%
fail I think that's a pretty decent
