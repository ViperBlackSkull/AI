prioritize is just to eat real food that
 

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.850 align:start position:0%
prioritize is just to eat real food that

those<00:27:57.100><c> are</c><00:27:57.370><c> supplements</c><00:27:57.910><c> to</c><00:27:58.150><c> your</c><00:27:58.300><c> diet</c><00:27:58.570><c> but</c>

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:58.810 align:start position:0%
those are supplements to your diet but
 

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
those are supplements to your diet but
not<00:27:59.140><c> to</c><00:27:59.380><c> replace</c><00:28:00.130><c> a</c><00:28:00.460><c> healthy</c><00:28:01.270><c> balanced</c><00:28:01.630><c> diet</c>

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.110 align:start position:0%

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.350 align:start position:0%
and and so I think that's just the over

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
like reliance on those instead of
 

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.730 align:start position:0%
