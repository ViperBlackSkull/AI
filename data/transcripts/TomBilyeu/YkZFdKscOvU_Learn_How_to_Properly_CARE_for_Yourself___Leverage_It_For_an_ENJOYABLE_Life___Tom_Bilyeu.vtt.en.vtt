realize that all of this starts with
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
realize that all of this starts with
belief<00:01:16.320><c> and</c><00:01:16.400><c> that's</c><00:01:16.640><c> why</c><00:01:16.799><c> i</c><00:01:16.880><c> say</c><00:01:17.040><c> that</c><00:01:17.200><c> belief</c>

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
belief and that's why i say that belief
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
belief and that's why i say that belief
determines<00:01:18.799><c> behavior</c><00:01:19.600><c> and</c><00:01:19.840><c> behavior</c><00:01:20.400><c> is</c><00:01:20.560><c> all</c>

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
determines behavior and behavior is all
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.429 align:start position:0%
determines behavior and behavior is all
that<00:01:20.799><c> matters</c><00:01:21.600><c> so</c><00:01:22.240><c> getting</c><00:01:22.479><c> the</c><00:01:22.640><c> belief</c><00:01:23.040><c> right</c>
