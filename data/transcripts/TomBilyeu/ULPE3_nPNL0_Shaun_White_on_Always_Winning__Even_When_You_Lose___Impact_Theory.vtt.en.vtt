00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.080
Tom: Everybody, welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.299
You're here, because like me and my friends,
you believe that human potential is nearly

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.299
limitless.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.930
You know that having potential is not the
same as actually doing something with it.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.160
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.050
are going to help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.189
All right.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.070
Today's guest was born with a heart defect
that required two open heart surgeries to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.720
correct, but he refused to let that slow him
down and proving that you can overcome any

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.399
obstacle through hard ass work.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.730
He is now the most decorated snowboarder on
the planet.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.000
Intensely driven, he turned pro in snowboarding
at the ripe old age of 13 and turned pro in

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.019
skateboarding by 17.

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.980
He's the youngest rider to ever win the US
Open, is the only rider to ever score a perfect

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.489
100 on the superpipe in the X Games.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.379
He's won two Olympic gold medals and a record
breaking 15 X Games gold medals.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.090
He's won 10 ESPY awards, is the only athlete
to win gold medals in, both, the summer and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.280
winter X Games.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.020
He reached number two on Business Week's list
of the 100 most powerful athletes, which,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.770
honestly, isn't too surprising given that
he's partnered with some of the biggest brands

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.770
around.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.100
He's designed massively successful apparel
lines and other goodies for the likes of Burton,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.140
Oakley, and Target.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.969
He's, also, an accomplished musician, whose
band, Bad Things, has played the main stage

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.579
at Lollapalooza and toured the world with
30 Seconds to Mars.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.540
To prove he has relevance well beyond sports,
he's also established himself as a top shelf

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.659
entrepreneur.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.420
He now owns a stake in Mammoth Resorts, is
the majority shareholder of 20 year old snowboarding

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.850
and music festival, Air and Style.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.630
He's launched a men's fashion line with Macy's
called WHT Space and wound up on the cover

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.539
of Forbes' 30 under 30 list in 2016.

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.250
Please help me in welcoming the passionate
philanthropist who works extensively with

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.659
charities, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation,
the man who has his own snowboards, skateboards,

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.360
clothing lines, and video game, the Shaun-trepreneur
himself, the unstoppable Shaun White.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.420
Shaun: Thanks for having me.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.420
Tom: Absolutely.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.480
It's a pleasure.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.130
Shaun: What an intro.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.130
Right?

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.390
Tom: The good news is with you, it was about
trimming down.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.410
That was like, "God, I can't even begin to
fit all the things that you've done."

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.410
Shaun: Yeah.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.410
Busy guy sometimes.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.420
Tom: Which is actually a perfect place to
start.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.390
Give us a sense, why not just focus on one
thing?

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.620
Not only do you do multiple sports, but you're
really, really active as an entrepreneur.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620
Shaun: Yeah.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.620
You know?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.620
It's strange.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.510
I've always just had my eyes open to what
was around me.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.600
Things would just come in and out of my life,
and it was up to me to really dig deeper on

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.810
those if it felt right or just pass and move
on to the next thing.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.590
Music, for example, that was something that
just came to me.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.900
I was competing at the X Games.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.070
I won the slope style event and the halfpipe,
which made me the athlete of the games, which

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.680
they called me.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.460
You win a guitar, and you win a car as the
prize.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.630
I remember thinking, "Sick.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.740
Let's drive the car."

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.370
I'm not thinking of this guitar.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.710
Randomly, I'd won this guitar.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.130
Then, my brother was like, "Oh, I'm going
to start playing guitar.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.160
That'd be cool."

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.850
Then, some kids in my neighborhood, and I'm
thinking to myself, "Wait a minute.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.460
I have a guitar."

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.650
It was a great guitar.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.440
It was a Fender Strat American made.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.720
I called my buddy, who actually brought home
from Colorado for me.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.490
Picked it up, starting playing, and fell in
love with playing.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.400
Then, the competitor in me was like, "You
know what?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.660
I want to do this.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.680
No one knows.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
I'm not going to tell anybody.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.200
I'm going to train just as hard as I would
train on the snowboard or something else,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.380
because maybe one day in the future I could
actually be in a band."

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.180
Wouldn't it be cool to pick up a guitar and
be able to really play, like a true musician.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.090
That was my long term goal, and I would play
and play and play.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.410
Then, the time came where I actually made
friends in music.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.700
I joined a band.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.770
We put out an album and toured.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.770
Yeah.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.440
Tom: Talk to me about, A, using competition,
but then, B, what it looks like to train the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.239
way that you train, like stretching your fingers
on long flights and picking the seam of your

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.239
jean.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.239
That's an incredible story.

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:24.239
Shaun: Yeah.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.569
It's a very simple thing in my mind when I
look at it.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:32.270
It sounds lame, but it's like you just do
what's hard until it's not hard anymore.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.740
I remember playing guitar, and I couldn't
up pick.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.620
I could only play punk rock songs, because
you just down pick the chords and whatnot.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.639
I would sit on the airplane, like you said,
and I would up stroke the seam of my pant

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.710
and listen to the music that was playing and
play along with it with the pick in my hand.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.250
Then, it became easy to do it.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.510
I slowly got past that hurdle.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.639
Then, a whole nother genre of music opened
up for me and that was it.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.009
Even when it came to snowboarding, there were
certain things that were very difficult to

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.789
get past.

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.900
I just remember doing it until it became easy.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.639
If you broke your hand and you weren't used
to riding with that hand, then you're forced

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.180
to ride, to use chopsticks, or to do something.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.320
Once you do it enough, it becomes, you know,
a casual thing to do.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.039
Tom: Here's what I find fascinating, though,
and I hope that people will hear in your stories.

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.469
There's a whole genre of medicine to deal
with people who, let's say, hurt their back.

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:34.469
Shaun: Yeah.

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.569
Tom: I remember one time I had a neck virus,
where you get a cold or something, and then

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.139
the virus settles into the muscle.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.360
This is how they explained it to me.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.840
I'm, actually, tempted to believe this is
bullshit, but nonetheless -

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840
Shaun: Sounds rough.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.830
Tom: The effect of it was, I was like this
for a week and a half.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.250
Every time I tried to move, I'd get this massive
spasm in my neck.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.250
The doctor said, "Okay.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.250
Here's what's crazy.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.310
If you don't force yourself to fight through
that and, ultimately, get your neck back upright,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.199
there are people who have lived 20, 30 years.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.650
They never get out of that position, because
they become so afraid of the pain."

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.879
Most people don't break their hand and get
good at the left, right?

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.460
They just stop and they wait until they heal,
or they may never get that good again.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.020
When did you realize that you could do that?

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.930
When did you fall in love with pushing yourself
to do that?

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.110
Shaun: Yeah.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.870
I would say through sports.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.509
At a young age, I was, you know, a lot of
angst.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.680
I wanted to do things, and that's where snowboarding
came along.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.680
It gave me that outlet.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.711
It was fun, and it was cool in the beginning.

00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:37.520
Then, my parents were like, "Oh, maybe he's
pretty good at it."

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.289
People around the mountain are telling them
I was pretty good.

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.120
They put me into a competition.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.139
It was a race, and I won't.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:45.150
I was pretty fast.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.960
Tom: This was at like seven, right?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.960
Shaun: Yeah.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960
Six, seven.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.010
I had skied at four.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.720
If you call it skiing.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.379
I wasn't allowed poles, because I would hit
people.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.479
I was really into the Ninja Turtles.

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.340
I had moves.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.779
I thought I had moves.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:07.210
See, I ended up not allowed poles, and then,
I would just go in to the trees and they'd

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.210
lose me.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.110
They'd be all worried about where I was, and
what would happen.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.139
They're like, "Oh.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:13.560
We'll put him on a snowboard.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.560
He'll be falling.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560
We'll keep track of him.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560
It'll be great."

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.419
Obviously, I figured it out pretty quickly.

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:25.740
Then, they put me in a competition at the
local resort up at Snow Summit, and you know,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.740
I won.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.740
That gave me this like, "Wow.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.860
I can win something."

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.080
Then, it gave me the passion to work hard
at something.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.379
To keep winning.

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:38.030
Once you get that taste of victory and you're
like, "Wow.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.949
Well, maybe I want to keep going on this path."

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.990
I think that was where it stemmed from.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.289
Then, the other huge component, which I'm
sure if you read any other sports book or

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:50.559
anything, I have an older brother.

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:51.770
Seven years older than me.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.770
A lot bigger.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.930
A lot stronger.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.319
A lot smarter.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.190
He was always beating me at everything I did.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.190
Everything.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.360
Monopoly, chess, anything, video games, snowboarding.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360
Everything.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.849
He was just always winning.

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:06.379
I just couldn't beat him.

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:08.419
I just kept at it.

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:12.289
Finally, crossed that barrier where I was
actually learning the tricks he was learning

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:16.210
at the time, but he's seven years older.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.479
In my age division, it was just no contest.

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:23.969
That's what kind of stemmed that whole me
turning pro at 13, because I was already ready

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:26.110
for the next level.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:32.440
Tom: Do you think about the birth order of
you, your brother, and sisters at all in,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.330
what ends up becoming your persona, in snowboarding,
and just that you got as good as you did?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.070
Shaun: I don't know.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.350
I think I got to learn from them.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.050
Even with my brother and sister, it was like,
"Oh, wow."

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.360
My brother chose this path.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.840
I'm going to do this.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840
Tom: That's interesting.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.610
I think one of the most fascinating things
about you is how uniquely you have carved

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.390
your way through it.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:03.870
If you don't mind, it's obviously a very famous
story in your lore, but just quickly when

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.510
all the guys decided they'd gone partying.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.800
They want to just split the winnings from
the race, but that didn't make sense for you,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.890
because you had to pay your own way.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.890
Shaun: Yeah.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:21.350
I was 15 years old, I flew to Japan to do
this big competition called the Toyota Big

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.350
Air.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:28.130
I remember getting there, I'm pretty sure,
the way it worked out is the specific invited

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.170
riders got a little bit of money to show up.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.690
Then, obviously there's great prize money.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.680
You had maybe three or four days of practice.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.720
I was 15, so my mom's there.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.350
I was paying out of my own travel to get the
flights, to get the food, to get the hotel,

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.880
and all of these things.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.150
I remember sitting there, and it's the game
day.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.700
We're supposed to hit the jump, and everyone's
complaining, which is like music to my ears.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.210
I'm having the best day ever.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.210
Yeah.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.980
The guys had gone out, we're in Japan.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:03.740
There's a lot of fun things to do I was in
my room with my mom doing my Algebra or whatever.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.780
I'm like, "All right.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.140
You guys go have fun.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.000
I'm going to do my school work."

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.910
Anyways, long story short, they all got together
and were like, "We're going to split the prize

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.630
money for the competition."

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.690
I'm sitting there thinking, "Wow."

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.050
Doing the quick math.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.821
I'm like, "This doesn't even cover the flights
once you split it up among all the riders

00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:26.940
and whatnot."

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.940
I said, "No."

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.490
At 15, I was like, "No.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.990
I want to compete."

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.410
They just sat there and hazed me.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.080
There was this board of all the rider's faces
for who was at the competition.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.890
They took turns drawing dollar signs in my
eyes and doing whatnot.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.190
I just remember being like, "I'm not going
to succumb to the peer pressure from this.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.190
I came here to compete.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.740
I'm feeling great."

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.700
I stuck to my gut feeling there, and I won.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.700
I won.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.270
I won $50,000 and a car.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.270
Yeah.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.050
It was a time where I just stuck to it, and
that was a big win for me.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:08.650
That was the first realization that I didn't
have to follow the pack.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:14.050
I didn't have to do what everyone else said,
because it's what they want, or should do,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.110
or what you're supposed to do.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.420
I just felt like, you know what, this is a
point where I should make a stand.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.980
I should really be me and own it.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.980
I did, and I won.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.360
It was pretty wild.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.560
That was a big one.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560
Tom: That's amazing.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.560
The reason I really wanted you to share that
story is in no uncertain terms when I was

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.620
15, I would have crumbled.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:38.200
I would have so wanted them to like me that
even if I had said no at first, about the

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.400
time they started drawing the dollar signs
on my eyes -

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.650
Shaun: Yeah.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.610
Tom: What gave you ... Was it having won in
the past?

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.950
Was it fights with your brother?

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.650
What gave you the ability to go, "I idolize
these guys.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:54.450
They're now really being mean."

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.520
How did you stay the course at that point?

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.810
Shaun: I don't know.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:04.750
I remember it being harsh, and they were lighthearted
joking in a way, but I know deep down they

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.030
were really pissed.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.860
I was the only one like, "No.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.860
We're going to ride."

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.820
I just remember thinking this could be my
chance to win, and I'm not going to let these

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.360
guys take that from me.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.670
I just stuck to it.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.111
I remember just putting my headphones on and
doing anything to distract myself, because

00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:27.220
nothing's going to slow down the clock when
we need to do the competition.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.581
It's definitely like a defining moment for
me to stand up for myself and what I want

00:12:31.581 --> 00:12:32.581
to accomplish.

00:12:32.581 --> 00:12:35.120
Tom: What's the nature of competition for
you?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.950
What does competition mean?

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.780
Shaun: It's a multiple of things.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:52.500
It's a chance to, I guess, go out and show
the hard work that's been put in and to display

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.500
it for everyone.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.060
Your chance to show off in a way.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:03.680
Another way, it's a chance to access some
deep part of yourself that is going to do

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.190
something you never thought you could or would
want to do.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.550
You know?

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.070
I have trouble now that I've gotten a little
bit older.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.800
I've just turned 30.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.550
Unfortunately, you think more I feel like.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.960
I'm like, "Ah.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.860
It's pretty icy today.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.860
It's a little windy.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.300
I feel like tomorrow."

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.540
Now, I've got the weather report.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.420
I'm like, "It's going to be better tomorrow.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.580
We should definitely come back tomorrow."

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.580
Procrastinating.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.400
You know, it's your chance to do something
great.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.060
I strive for those moments.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:44.500
I wish I could recreate them in the normal
life setting, because it changes from a "I

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.780
want to do this new trick" to "I have to do
this new trick."

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.890
It's the best, because it takes that seed
of doubt out of your mind.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.920
Once that doubt is gone, like if I asked you
to jump over the table or something, and you

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.300
were like going to practice it.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.300
Then, we're like, "All right.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.370
We're going to film this one."

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.480
I better make it.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.360
You know what I mean?

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.640
You're expected to jump over the table.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.810
It's going to happen, so what are you going
to do to best prepare yourself.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:18.310
That's that motivation of getting to the contest,
throwing the big tricks, and seeing your competition

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.700
and that motivation.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.340
I've always loved that.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.840
Interesting enough, the dynamic in my family
was my brother.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.220
Extremely talented guy.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.220
Amazing on a snowboard.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.400
Could do any trick you could think of, but
you put a camera on him or you put him in

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.800
a contest scenario, he couldn't do it.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.430
The pressure and awkwardness of like, "All
right.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.970
Go," sort of thing.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.140
I remember I was slightly the opposite.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.590
Where I would do all right in practice, and
then they're like, "all right.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.070
It's contest time," and I would do better.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.530
I know that I have that in me.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.860
I've always loved -
Tom: Is that something you've cultivate?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.230
Shaun: I think over time it just became so.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:03.160
You get used to ... If you hate speaking in
public and you've got to talk and make speeches

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.630
all the time, you're going to get comfortable
at it.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.640
Just like us talking now, I used to look back
on my interviews, and I was terrified.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.240
I was like, "Why was that such a bad interview?

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.560
Well, because you're not thinking about your
answer.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.660
You're talking and then trying to steer it
where you want it to go."

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.800
I would learn from that.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.040
Then, try it again the next time.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.740
An interview you realize you're in the driver's
seat of where you want to go with your answers.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.050
You could ask anything, but I could tell what
I want to say in a way.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.280
That's the funny thing, but you learn these
things over time.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.950
If you can imagine, obviously, I've been competing
since I was six years old, you develop these

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.260
rhythms and the way you go about it.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.110
I know that when I get to the contest like
this is going to happen.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.110
You can bank on those moments.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.940
That's really what competition is for me.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:56.760
It's a way to really tap something in me that
I don't normally get.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:05.240
I was at the X Games, and I did, in my run,
I broke an old record.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.730
I went 24ft out of the 22ft halfpipe.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.180
I was up there.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.130
It was funny, because I wasn't going that
big all day, but it was the contest time.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.470
I was jacked up, and I dropped in.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.130
Then, I hit that marker.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:23.630
I recently broke that record at the US Open
of Snowboarding in Vail last season.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.630
I went 26ft.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.500
It just kind of comes out of you, and you
do better.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.100
That's what competition is for me, for sure.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.100
Tom: All right.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.910
If your brother, Jesse, came to and said,
"All right.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.790
I really do feel like I'm gifted, talents,
but I don't do as well with the pressure.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.250
Teach me."

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.660
What would be a couple things that you would
know right away.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.440
I've got to get him to understand this, do
this, pre-visualize whatever.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.730
Shaun: Yeah.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.010
Visualize, definitely.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:53.460
That's the thing for me, it's always been,
"Well, what's it going to look like?

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.570
What's it going to feel like?

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.550
What am I going to be wearing?"

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.660
Every little detail and visualize yourself
winning.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.920
What are you going to do after?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.341
You know, you just project it and it happens.

00:17:05.341 --> 00:17:08.570
I've always set goals for myself.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.570
That's a huge one.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.959
Set the goal of like, "What do you really
want to do?

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:14.240
What is it in the end?"

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.790
For me, I would always setup a fun goal, and
then a serious goal.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:25.049
One year, one of the goals was how many cars
can I win.

00:17:25.049 --> 00:17:28.940
The snowboard contests would give out cars
if you won the series.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.159
Obviously, yeah, winning the series is amazing.

00:17:33.159 --> 00:17:36.100
That's a feat of its own, but I broke it down
to, "I've just got to win the cars."

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.570
You know what I mean?

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.490
It made it into this stupid game where it
dumbed it down slightly.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.639
Tom: Does that help alleviate the pressure?

00:17:45.639 --> 00:17:46.639
Shaun: A little bit.

00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:47.639
Yeah.

00:17:47.639 --> 00:17:49.970
Obviously, you have serious goals of, "I want
to win the Olympics.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.129
Then, I want to see how many cars I can win."

00:17:52.129 --> 00:17:58.350
It made it this fun thing of taking a little
bit of the edge off, because it's such a daunting

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.039
task when you look at it from, "Wow.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:01.809
I'm going to try to win the Olympics."

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:04.559
It's such a big thing.

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:07.320
Then, you really break it down into these
smaller things.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.590
It's more edible that way.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.409
Tom: Did you come to stuff like that more
naturally or was it like you knew, "I need

00:18:13.409 --> 00:18:17.429
to manage my mind," which is what I hear as
you talk through this stuff?

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.429
Shaun: Yeah.

00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:21.240
I don't know if I knew what I was doing.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.900
Now that I'm a bit older, I see the ... I
can break it down for what was happening,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.120
but it just felt like there was so much pressure.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120
Man.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.740
You've got to do this.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.740
You've got to do that.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.880
It just help like there was so much weight
on it, and I would always turn it to my favor.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.000
Any which way you spin it, I'm winning in
a way.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.040
If you look at a competition, like this last
X Games I went to.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.150
I didn't win, but I really feel like I won,
because I know exactly what I need to work

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.150
on now.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.150
I know exactly what happened.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.620
I did wrong, and I've got to go back.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.159
That's why it's still winning to me.

00:18:57.159 --> 00:19:01.360
Where, if I did win, I think about it like,
"Wow.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.350
I'm exactly on the path I'm supposed to be
going.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.289
The training and the ideas I've had before
are working.

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:08.740
This is where you go."

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:16.150
It's not like even the slight step backs are
actually to leap forward in a way, because

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:21.030
how are you going to know where you lay in
the whole field of things and what's going

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.030
on.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.080
It's to take a step back, and then go, "Okay."

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.309
You reassess, refocus.

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:30.539
Even I was talking to some people in the green
room, and they were talking about Russia Calling.

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.360
I watched that, and I was like, "Man.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360
Okay.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.360
That wasn't right.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.669
It didn't normally play out that way.

00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:39.499
I'm going to change that for this next time
or I'm going to do this and that."

00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:44.240
If you're always looking to better the situation,
and I've been to contests before where I really

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.490
wanted to win, and I put everything on the
line for that event, and I didn't win.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.490
I went, "Man.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.169
You put too much pressure on it.

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:51.169
You did this.

00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:52.220
You did that."

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.000
There's such a thing as over practicing, too.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.740
A lot of guys show up at the competitions,
and there's two hours to ride.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.121
They ride ... They're the first one there
at the gate.

00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:03.121
They ride two hours.

00:20:03.121 --> 00:20:06.789
Then, they landed their run.

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:08.210
Fifteen perfect runs.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.380
Then, they get to the contest and they fall.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.380
I'm like, "Yeah.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.770
You just nailed it 15 times.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.950
It's like rolling dice.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.200
You're going to hit seven.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.169
You're going to crap out."

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:21.179
Save it for the real contest.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:22.409
You know you got it.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.529
You've got to be your own friend in that scenario.

00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:30.600
Tom: I really hope, dear listeners, that you
paid attention to that, because here's what's

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.259
powerful in that and here's why I think you're
going to have unprecedented success for an

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:38.130
athlete in your after career as an entrepreneur.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.519
Because all the mental tricks that you're
using in sport are exactly what you're going

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:44.580
to have to do in business.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.910
In business, you're going to get your ass
handed to you.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.910
I'm sure you already have.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.370
It's only going to keep continuing.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.830
It's a natural part of it.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.360
Shaun: But you learn.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360
Exactly.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.360
Tom: Exactly.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360
Shaun: Well, that didn't work.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.360
Tom: 100%.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.980
When you're saying that, you know, "I went
to the X Games.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.640
I didn't win, but I feel like I did win, because
I know how to frame that in my mind.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.240
I know how to look at that as, okay, now I'm
going to assess."

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.169
If you had said, and I was actually really
afraid you were going to say, "If I had won

00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:10.269
it wouldn't have been as good."

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.269
You didn't.

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.220
You said, "If I had won that I would know
okay cool.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.309
I'm on the right path."

00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:16.270
You're going to make a win out of it either
way, right?

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.270
Shaun: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.480
Tom: There's a great book called Sometimes
You Win, Sometimes You Learn.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.119
If that's your mentality -
Shaun: That's great.

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.119
Tom: Right.

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:26.700
Then, you can never really lose, because you're
playing a much longer game than everybody

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.700
else.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.700
Shaun: Yeah.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.190
Tom: It's like, I always tell people, "Think
of life as practice."

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.889
I came into competition very late.

00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:35.049
My sister was really good at basketball.

00:21:35.049 --> 00:21:36.409
She's really good at every sport.

00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:37.409
Shaun: That'll do it.

00:21:37.409 --> 00:21:40.110
Tom: Unlike you, who got better than your
brother, I did not get better than my sister.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.249
Shaun: Oh, okay.

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:43.280
Tom: I tried to do all the things that she
was good at.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.210
I was terrible at them, because I had a fixed
mindset.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.490
I didn't believe that I could go practice
and get better.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.270
It never occurred to me.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.850
Practice time was just facing my inadequacies
over and over and over.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.440
I wasn't able to compute that, "Hey.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.080
If I do this, I'll actually progress and get
better."

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.639
As an adult, though, I found that, and business
became that for me.

00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:03.639
That, "Hey.

00:22:03.639 --> 00:22:05.559
If I treated this like practice and I'm really
just trying to get good.

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:08.290
Then, over a long enough timeline this will
add up to something."

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.290
Shaun: Yeah.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.399
Tom: Then, while other people are freaking
out about a lost deal, about blowing a meeting,

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:18.039
about not getting hired or fired, or whatever
the case may be, they're not looking at it

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.039
on a long enough timeline.

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:20.039
I'm thinking, "Ah.

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:22.659
I totally screwed that meeting up, but what
did I learn?

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:23.659
I learned this.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:24.710
Now, I have that skillset.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.460
I can go on and get better."

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:32.570
The reason I was asking you to define competition,
for me, competition is being tested.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.669
I want to be tested.

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:37.039
Now, I didn't when I was younger, because
I just assumed I would fail.

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:43.029
Once you believe you're in control over whether
or not you win, then competition becomes intoxicating.

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:48.830
It's a moment where, now, it isn't just practicing
snowboarding down the mountain over and over.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.330
There's something real that this is working
towards.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.190
It's going to be a moment of immense pressure,
and I get to see if I'm better than everybody.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.190
Shaun: Yeah.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.190
Of course.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.190
No.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.190
It's true, though.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.690
In that moment of, "Well, I put in the work."

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.730
It's the actual, that's what you're going
for.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.730
Yeah.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.110
You said, "In business, you can fail here
and there, and it's the same idea of trying

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.950
something over and over."

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.179
Finally, cracking the code on it.

00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:15.100
Then, once you get that win, you get that
experience, and know that you can succeed,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.509
it's that, like I said in competition, that
seed of doubt goes away.

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:21.629
You show up to win every time.

00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:24.070
That's the only option.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.990
Once that's the only option, it's even more
obtainable.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.409
Tom: Say that again.

00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:28.409
It's even more obtainable.

00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:30.619
What do you mean by that, because that so
true?

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:32.039
Shaun: Yeah.

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:33.039
It's just in the air.

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.039
You put it out there.

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:35.350
You just feel it, and you're like, "Wow.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:40.220
Well, I know ... " Back to the table ...
Tom: Thank God this is recorded.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.350
Where would we be, Shaun?

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.350
Shaun: I know.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.279
It's a lot of metaphors.

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:50.370
If I asked you to do a feat, and you actually
accomplished it, you have that knowledge now

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.240
going back to do it again.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240
"Well, oh.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.159
I've already jumped over this, or I've already
done this thing in business.

00:23:57.159 --> 00:23:58.159
It's old news."

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:03.899
You go in with even more confidence than you
had that it took to win the first time.

00:24:03.899 --> 00:24:12.690
You have that in you and projecting that positive
thing always just leads to better outcomes

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.059
either way.

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:16.380
Even with pressure as well.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.650
When people say, "How do you deal with the
pressure?"

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.759
I'm just so thankful for the pressure.

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:22.759
You know?

00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:26.289
They're like, "Everybody thinks you're going
to win the Olympics."

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:30.279
I go, "Well, if everybody thinks I'm going
to win, that's great."

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:34.269
I'm like, "That's a lot of people believing
in me, thinking that I can do it."

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:35.269
Hey.

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:38.320
Maybe I just might be able to do it.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.080
Instead of letting it weigh me down, like
"Oh my God.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.269
All these people are expecting this from me,
and I'm expecting this from myself.

00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:45.269
It's just too much.

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:46.960
Can't handle it."

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960
No.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960
It's a blessing.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.049
It's a great thing to have people counting
on you and needing that.

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:55.450
It's all leading up to that, sort of like
you know you can win.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.190
You felt it before.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.980
You know what's obtainable.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.230
Everybody else believes in you.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.330
You're a team rather than letting it weigh
you down.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:08.260
If you can put that subtle spin on things
and use it to your advantage, it's always

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.980
a better scenario.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.809
I've let the pressure get to me before.

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:14.450
It's just, "Well, that didn't work."

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.500
You know?

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.100
I was terrified of this to happen, you learn
from that and you go on.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.460
There's always lessons to be learned.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.460
Even learning tricks.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.460
It's a basic thing.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.460
It's like a math problem.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.309
You're through solutions at it, and finally,
the numbers work and it clicks.

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:30.539
It works out.

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:32.580
Same with snowboarding and jumps.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.580
Learning a new trick.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.159
You learn the very important lesson, a simple
lesson, or what not to do.

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:38.159
"Hey.

00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:39.360
I've tried this."

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360
You watched the video.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360
"Aw.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360
I took off wrong.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.259
I'm going to try it again and again and again."

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:47.210
You get to a point where you get the confidence,
the muscle memory.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.049
You get the ability to then do that trick.

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:54.759
Now, it's yours, and then you can do it at
a competition when it really matters.

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:59.440
The practice, like you said, it's something
you get over time.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.309
Tom: When you were doing the build up for
the Sochi Olympics, and you were trying to

00:26:05.309 --> 00:26:09.080
learn the new trick ... Obviously, in the
documentary it was so cool.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.840
By the way, I don't know how you felt about
making that available to the public.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.530
You were so raw and so vulnerable.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.929
Admitting that, "I've never had a road block
like this.

00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:20.119
I've never been afraid to try something like
this."

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:25.309
As somebody watching the documentary, that
was so powerful to me to know that, A, somebody

00:26:25.309 --> 00:26:31.299
that you look up to and admire and think they've
just done something inhuman.

00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:35.220
It's more interesting to me that you had to
overcome that than if you just "Ah."

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.649
If it was just easy for you, that's not inspiring.

00:26:37.649 --> 00:26:38.649
Shaun: Yeah.

00:26:38.649 --> 00:26:39.649
Here's the winning run.

00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:40.649
Tom: Exactly.

00:26:40.649 --> 00:26:41.649
Shaun: Totally.

00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:42.649
Tom: To see the fight.

00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:46.649
How did you, in that specific example, how
did you deal with the fear?

00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:52.159
When you had crashed ... Dude, that shit looked
like it was going to break you in half.

00:26:52.159 --> 00:26:53.309
Shaun: Yeah.

00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:56.630
I took a bad spill.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:01.080
If that were a competition, I would have landed
it, because I had to.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.499
I dropped in, and I went to do that trick.

00:27:03.499 --> 00:27:09.289
I was doing, I don't know if you seen there's
a video out of me attempting the first triple

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:11.539
flip in the halfpipe.

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:14.860
You can watch the video, and I slowly I do
the one rotation.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.860
Everything's great.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.860
I do the second rotation.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:22.139
Then, halfway through the third, I decide
that I don't want to do a third flip, and

00:27:22.139 --> 00:27:23.669
I open up.

00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:25.879
That slows your rotation down.

00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:27.379
It changes things.

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:31.059
That mindset got in there, and I decided I'm
nervous about this.

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:34.559
I opened up, and I caught the lip of the halfpipe.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:40.289
Now, the wall is 22ft tall, so I then bounce
off of the lip and flew to the bottom of the

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:41.289
halfpipe.

00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:42.299
My helmet came off.

00:27:42.299 --> 00:27:44.559
It's, actually, a pretty spectacular crash.

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:45.559
Tom: Yes.

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:46.559
Spectacular.

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:49.620
Shaun: The goggles come off of my helmet,
and then the lenses come out of the goggles.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.299
It was bad.

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:55.759
There's all my stuff everywhere.

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:58.929
I don't know if you've ever been concussed
before?

00:27:58.929 --> 00:27:59.929
Tom: No.

00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:00.929
Thankfully.

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:02.570
Shaun: It's a very surreal thing.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:03.649
I wasn't in any pain.

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:05.190
I was just sitting there like, "Wow.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.289
This is that moment that I dreamt about."

00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:12.169
It's like a deja vu feeling of like, "I've
been here before.

00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:15.440
This is ... I swear ... " I just remember
going, "Wow.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.549
This is that moment.

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:18.130
This sucks."

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.710
You know?

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.710
Okay.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.740
I remember going to the hospital, getting
all checked out.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:30.609
I had slightly separated my shoulder, and
my pelvis has all bent out of shape.

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:33.269
I had a bit of a concussion from it.

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:34.350
Yeah.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:39.779
Going back to doing that again, yeah, I had
to look at the video and think about what

00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:42.950
I did and what I could have done differently.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.169
Something happened, though, that saved me
right in the middle of it.

00:28:46.169 --> 00:28:51.559
I don't know if it was a good thing or a bad
thing, because it steered me from my path.

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:55.320
Another competitor of mine created a new trick.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.200
He deemed it the YOLO flip.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.169
You Only Live Once flip, I guess.

00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:05.350
Tom: Yes.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.200
Shaun: He created this new trick, and I'm
like, "Oh.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.080
I have to do this trick."

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.289
It really inspired me.

00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:18.830
I learned his trick, first try, three days
later.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.929
I was that motivated to do it, because I saw
a competitor.

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:24.669
I knew it could be done, because he did it.

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:26.279
Well, why can't I do it?

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:33.460
It really paved the way for it rather than
doing something that had never been done before.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:38.210
To create that excitement, that pressure,
and to look at it like, this year, I've decided

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.720
to do every single competition that I can
enter.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.159
Just because I know getting to that pressure
scenario when I was younger, I didn't think

00:29:45.159 --> 00:29:46.159
as much.

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.789
I would just throw my tricks and that was
it.

00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:49.820
Nowadays, I need that extra motivation.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.429
That coaxing into it.

00:29:51.429 --> 00:29:54.970
To get rid of that seed of doubt, I show up
at contests now.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.029
It's kind of like knowing yourself as well
as knowing your strengths and your weaknesses,

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:01.029
and sticking to that.

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:04.690
What are you really good at, and what are
you not?

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.539
Being real and honest with yourself about
it.

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:10.600
There's a difference between working hard
at something that you're not good at and forcing

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.820
it.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.869
That's the inner question that you have to
ask.

00:30:14.869 --> 00:30:18.330
I've always found that to be a truth for me.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.330
You know?

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.330
Tom: What drives you now?

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.619
You've accomplished so much, it's absurd.

00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:28.080
Writing your intro, it was a matter of, how
do you trim things out, right?

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.869
Your list of accomplishments is ridiculous.

00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:31.950
Shaun: Thank you.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.340
Tom: It's dangerous, dude.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.080
What you do is dangerous.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.210
How do you push yourself to keep pushing,
stay relevant, to really progress the sport

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.629
when it's like, "I'm Shaun White, bitches."

00:30:44.629 --> 00:30:48.210
How do you ...
Shaun: That's what it says on my car.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.210
Yeah.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:55.399
You saw me pull in, huh?

00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:56.600
How do I stay motivated?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.119
You know, man, it's a mixture of things.

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:03.049
It's like there's always new goals.

00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:04.929
There's always new things to do.

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:11.190
Obviously, when it comes to snowboarding,
going to an Olympics and not doing well.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:16.119
Obviously, at Sochi, not getting the gold
medal and all that, man, extremely motivating.

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:17.220
Extremely eye opening.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.330
I'd never gone to an Olympics and not won.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.970
That was the first time for me.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:21.970
I was like, "Wow.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.970
How do I feel about this?

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:23.970
What happens after?"

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:29.059
It was amazing for me to realize that people
were still like, "Oh, you're the champ.

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:30.059
You're the guy."

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:31.059
You Know?

00:31:31.059 --> 00:31:32.059
I don't know.

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:35.830
For some reason, in my mind, just assumed
that if you don't win, they immediately strip

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.419
all of the other medals, and you're just some
guy.

00:31:38.419 --> 00:31:39.539
Your superpowers are gone.

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:42.700
You're just like the dude in the glasses at
work.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.330
I was like, "Oh no."

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.419
I just remember feeling this overwhelming
like, "Wow.

00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:52.419
I'm still alive.

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:53.419
I'm still here."

00:31:53.419 --> 00:31:55.529
The worst thing I could have imagined, happened.

00:31:55.529 --> 00:31:56.860
I was still here.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.690
I was considered the great in the sport.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.999
It did a lot for me, personally.

00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:02.999
I was like, "Wow.

00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:03.999
I can actually lose."

00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:04.999
I hadn't lost.

00:32:04.999 --> 00:32:10.629
I mean, this reign of me winning, it's been
a long, long thing.

00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:12.679
Obviously, that was just one night.

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:14.600
One contest, but the world was watching.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.929
It was pretty rough to lose, but you realize
that, "Yeah.

00:32:17.929 --> 00:32:20.730
It's just that one moment, and you've got
to get back up."

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.259
That's the true spirit of the sport.

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:23.929
It's to come back, and it's like Rocky.

00:32:23.929 --> 00:32:25.649
He didn't even win the first movie.

00:32:25.649 --> 00:32:27.090
It's the thrill.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.229
The fight to get there.

00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:33.190
You become part of the US team, the Olympics,
and all of that.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.140
It's such an amazing and memorable thing.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.269
Then, to actually go and compete.

00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:40.190
The bounce back from that was amazing.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:47.149
I remember sitting there thinking, instead
of curling up and like, "All right.

00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:48.149
Yeah.

00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:49.149
They're saying I'm getting older.

00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:50.279
Maybe I should quit."

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:52.279
I didn't want to quit.

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:55.570
It was just put in my head so many times by
the media that I was ... They're comparing

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:56.820
me to a 14 year old.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.989
Of course, I'm going to look a lot older.

00:32:58.989 --> 00:33:00.409
This kid is 14.

00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:01.480
You know?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.590
You start hearing it so much, you kind of
believe it.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.159
I remember sitting there thinking, "Wow.

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:09.679
Well, I don't feel that way.

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:10.679
I'm not done.

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:12.400
I don't want to be done."

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.629
Obviously, there's other things in my life
that were capturing my attention at that time,

00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:18.629
but the thrill was still there.

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:22.429
I had new found motivation from not winning.

00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:29.080
I remember thinking from our wins and lessons
scenario I was like, "Wow.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.570
What's to learn from this?

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.919
How do I better myself?"

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:35.879
I sat there thinking, I actually probably
said it out loud to some friends, "I'm going

00:33:35.879 --> 00:33:40.950
to do more than I've ever done after an Olympics
this time around."

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:45.519
Normally, what happens is you get this flood
of, "Hey."

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:46.940
This company wants to endorse you.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.830
You're the Olympic gold medalist and blah,
blah, blah.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.090
You totally deserve to do that.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.690
You won, and it's the quick money that comes
your way.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:59.090
Before the world turns around, it's off to
the next thing.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.679
I wasn't getting those floods of offers.

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:08.260
I was getting offers still, but it wasn't
like the quick gold rush scenario.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.780
I was like, "Well, what do I want to do?

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.720
What do I truly want to do?"

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:18.339
Since that Olympics, in business man, I no
longer ride for a mountain.

00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:20.760
I'm a part owner of a mountain resort.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.500
Big Bear Snow Summit and Mammoth Mountain.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.960
Yeah.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.119
I still compete, but I now own my own competition
series.

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:29.159
Music Festival Series.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:37.940
I've changed my boys clothing line to a men's
clothing line, because it fits my vibe of

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.339
who I am today, not who I was before.

00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:41.980
Tom: Do you know Michael Strahan?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.089
NFL Hall of Famer.

00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:44.089
Good Morning America.

00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:45.089
Shaun: Michael, yeah.

00:34:45.089 --> 00:34:46.089
Of course.

00:34:46.089 --> 00:34:47.089
Tom: He talked about that.

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:50.760
That if you want to have longevity in a career,
at some point, you have to get really serious

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.760
about your training.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.760
Shaun: Yeah.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.190
Tom: A lot of NFL guys have talked about you
don't bulk up as you go longer in the NFL.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.030
You actually start to get leaner, meaner,
tighter.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:06.400
Jerry Rice, who had one of the most unbelievably
high performance, long lasting careers.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.490
Worked out like a demon.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.490
His whole thing.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.299
Terrell Owens, who we've had on the show.

00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:11.299
Shaun: Wow.

00:35:11.299 --> 00:35:12.380
Tom: Same thing.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.510
Work ethic.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.380
Really treating your body like a tool.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.020
That's the weapon with which you're going
to win the war.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.589
It'll be really fascinating, I'll put a chip,
that if you keep up with that, that'll magnify

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:26.690
your ... You love Agassi.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:27.690
Shaun: I do.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:28.690
Yeah.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:31.970
Tom: Crushed it by -
Shaun: It was interesting to see.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.370
I read his book, Open, which was amazing.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.370
Yeah.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.789
It was funny to see in his career, because
I was always comparing, obviously you read

00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:40.789
the book.

00:35:40.789 --> 00:35:42.630
I'm like comparing my life to his.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:48.880
The one thing is he never really enjoyed tennis,
because everything was tennis for him.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.319
Once he found his life wasn't tennis, it was
his wife, his foundation, and his family.

00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:54.910
Then, he would go out on the court.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:36:00.690
He was more dangerous, because he had that
slight bit of like, "Well, I don't care."

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.740
You know, like that feeling I got after losing.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.740
"Wow.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.740
I'm still here.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.740
I'm still alive.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.559
My dog still likes me.

00:36:07.559 --> 00:36:09.010
My house isn't taken away."

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.780
You know what I mean?

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.920
He became an even greater tennis player than
he was, it felt like.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.030
At least, maybe, my recollection of the book.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.990
I was comparing that to my life.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.549
I always felt like snowboarding's been a part
of, it's not me.

00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:24.070
It's not my life.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:29.589
It's what I do for fun, and it's what I do
competitively, but it's not who I am.

00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:30.720
I've always felt that way.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.119
Tom: I mean, it certainly answers the question
of why you've done so many diverse things

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:39.079
in your career from music, which you take
it seriously, man.

00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:40.080
You're not a dabbler.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.670
You're a full blown rock guitar player.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.579
I mean, it's crazy.

00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:49.130
I didn't know a lot about the music side of
you when I was researching.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.990
When you were like, "Yeah.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.910
I went on tour with 30 Seconds to Mars."

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.140
I was like, "What the fuck?"

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140
Shaun: Yeah.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.140
Tom: That's for real.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.140
Shaun: Yeah.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.140
It was heavy.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.970
I've always loved that about music, that there
wasn't really a competition.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.020
It was more, you just create and you keep
doing that.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.359
You keep trying to better your craft.

00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:11.700
Then, within that, there's a team element,
because I remember standing and I was like,

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.920
"Man, I've got to ... " It was our first show.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.653
I got on stage, and I was like, "Okay.

00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:19.653
I've got to do this."

00:37:19.653 --> 00:37:21.140
I was talking to myself.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.549
Everyone laughed and looked at me like, "No.

00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:23.560
We've got to do this."

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.560
You know?

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.829
You can play that guitar all you want, but
unless I'm on time and everybody else does

00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:29.829
their thing.

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:32.460
That really was an amazing thing that we were
all there together.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.539
That's something that I never really had in
snowboarding, because it was always like,

00:37:36.539 --> 00:37:40.260
"I'm going to practice today and this and
that and whatnot."

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.260
Yeah.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.630
A really amazing time with the music.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:48.690
It gave me a lot of appreciation for that
lifestyle and the amount of work that goes

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.690
into it.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.690
I mean, even Jared.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:51.690
Gosh.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:56.619
To see the levels of, we were playing dive
bars to a festival to seeing a guy sellout

00:37:56.619 --> 00:37:58.330
an arena was just incredible.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:04.040
That amount of effort that goes into it night
after night doing the same show and bettering

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040
it.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:11.599
I mean, the guy's learning bits and pieces
of every language from whatever part of the

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:12.599
world he's playing in.

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:14.230
It was just incredible to see.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.230
Very inspiring.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.230
Tom: Yeah.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.490
It's interesting.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:23.460
Having been to his house, the way that he
has everything laid out so that he can maximize

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.460
his time.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.900
He's got like three companies operating out
of his house, which tells you something about

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.579
the size of his house, which is an old military
base.

00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:31.650
Shaun: It's an old base.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.650
Tom: Which is crazy.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.010
Shaun: He's on another level.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.660
Tom: Oh, very much so.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.660
It's incredible.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.660
Shaun: I thought I worked a lot.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.300
I was like, "Man, this guy."

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.960
Tom: You do work a lot, though.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960
Shaun: I do.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960
Yeah.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.960
Tom: How do you think about time management?

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.920
Shaun: That's been a real tough one for me,
because I guess going to traditional school

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.579
setting you learn to manage your time from
this class, and "Oh, I want to go to the mall

00:38:54.579 --> 00:38:55.980
tonight."

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.980
I never really had that.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:02.970
I was always just in a van with my parents
going to the next competition and doing whatnot.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.039
As I got older, that was something that took
a lot of time and I'm still pretty terrible

00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:08.120
at it.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.630
I have a really great assistant.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:17.180
That's when you realize to any great person
you see, there are people around helping,

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.289
because you can't do it all.

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:19.289
It's just too much.

00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:21.560
You've got to know your strengths and weaknesses.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.790
I'm terrible at scheduling, and I can't accomplish
all these things I want to do without somebody

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.790
coming in to help.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.970
That's where you've got to rely on people
around you in that sense.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.250
Tom: It's interesting.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.119
For somebody who has so many things going
on, usually the first things to go are details,

00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:39.880
but you're actually super focused on the details.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:45.069
I know for the WHT Space, you hand painted
150 motorcycle jackets.

00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:46.069
Shaun: Yeah.

00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:50.971
Tom: Why was that important enough for you
to put ... It was like five days locked in

00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:52.560
a warehouse.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.619
Shaun: Yeah.

00:39:55.619 --> 00:40:00.039
I think ... Well, what's funny is when everybody
looks at the thing.

00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:06.190
Well, if you broke up my time, you would think
that I'm like "Well, he's 50% this and 10%

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.190
that and whatnot."

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.190
No.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.559
I'm 100% everything.

00:40:09.559 --> 00:40:13.559
It gets my full attention.

00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:18.380
The jackets, for example, we came up with
this great idea to ... Well, I was sitting

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.470
around with some friends.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:23.680
I was like, "Man, we should do like really
cool, custom painted leather jackets.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.640
We'll do like a 'If you're the right person
on the right day, and you show up to a Macy's,

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:38.040
you'll be 1 of 150 that will get the chance
to buy these leather jackets that I hand painted.'"

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.890
The details that I missed is that I don't
paint.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:41.890
I don't paint.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.900
Tom: That's worth considering.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.089
Shaun: I was like, "This is a great idea."

00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:54.450
Then, it dawned on me that I didn't really
have a concept of what I wanted the visuals

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.410
on the jacket to look like and whatnot.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.279
I started calling some artist friends of mine.

00:40:58.279 --> 00:40:59.279
I'm like, "Okay.

00:40:59.279 --> 00:41:00.579
It'll be a mixture of this and that."

00:41:00.579 --> 00:41:05.730
Then, the perfectionist in me was like ... We
started painting some jackets, and I stumbled

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.940
upon a design that I really liked.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.309
Then, I was like, "This is it.

00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:14.980
This is the aesthetic I want to do."

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:21.890
Then, I went back with a couple of friends
that just helped fan and dry the jackets and

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.450
hang them up around the studio that we had.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.410
I painted all those jackets myself.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.410
Tom: Wow.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:33.240
Shaun: We spent about five days and nights
in the warehouse there in Downtown LA.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.240
Every single thing that has brought me to
this place has been like a long play.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.369
I mentioned in the beginning, I was just like
my eyes were open enough to see the opportunities

00:41:42.369 --> 00:41:43.400
at hand.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.880
Tom: Your eyes were open enough to see the
opportunities, which is incredible.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.460
That notion of, I'm going to put the word
in your mouth, flow.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.500
You're almost moving through these business
opportunities with the grace that you show

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.750
when you're skating or snowboarding, which
is pretty incredible.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.740
You also have the balls to pull the trigger,
and that's where a lot of people fall down.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.430
They, maybe, see the opportunity, but they
don't actually have the vision of what they

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.920
want to do with it or the guts to do it.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.100
To actually buy in to it.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:13.330
If they buy in to it, they don't spend the
five days locked in the warehouse painting

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.330
on the jacket, though.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.330
Shaun: Yeah.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.330
Yeah.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:17.330
To follow through.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.109
Tom: That really, to me, that's where so many
entrepreneurs fall apart is at the end of

00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:21.190
the day only action matters.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.190
Right?

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.190
All right.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.990
I've got one more question for you, but first,
tell these guys where they can find you.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.099
Definitely tell them about Air and Style,
because we're right around the corner.

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:30.260
Shaun: Air and Style.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:35.900
It is happening this February 18th and 19th
at the Colosseum in Downtown LA.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.040
Really amazing bands are coming.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.520
We've got Flume, Major Lazer, Vince Staples,
YG, TV On The Radio.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.660
Then, we're building a 16-story snowboard
jump, where the world's best are coming to

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.660
compete.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.660
All happening this February.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.660
You can go to airandstyle.com and get your
tickets.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:50.660
I'll see you there.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.660
Tom: Nice.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.020
Shaun: It's a nice one.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.240
Tom: All right.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240
Cool.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.240
My last question.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.270
What is the impact that you want to have on
the world?

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.690
Shaun: Impact?

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.780
Like I touched on in the beginning is that,
yes, snowboarding is a part of my life, it's

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.099
definitely not my life and all that I am.

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:13.680
I feel like my thing that I would leave is
that I hope to be looked at as someone that

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:21.039
really didn't see the boundaries of what you
should and shouldn't do.

00:43:21.039 --> 00:43:24.060
I did the road less traveled.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.799
I did the things that people said couldn't
be done.

00:43:26.799 --> 00:43:28.079
That's kind of the goal for me.

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:30.690
Tom: It's a pretty damn good thing to leave
behind.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.130
Shaun: Yeah.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.130
That's it.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.420
Tom: Shaun, thank you so much for coming on.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.420
Shaun: All right.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.420
Thank you.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.420
Yeah.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.420
Tom: That was incredible.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.420
Shaun: Thank you for having me.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.420
Tom: Guys, I hope that you took away from
this man what I took away from him, which

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.950
is it really doesn't matter what anybody tells
you, you can be, what you're up against, where

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.440
you start with double open heart surgery.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.130
It's all about what you're trying to become,
and how hard you're willing to work to get

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.130
there.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:57.119
It is absolutely incredible the way that this
man has totally bucked peer pressure.

00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:58.440
He does not fuck around with that.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.660
He has stayed true to who he is, what he wants
to accomplish, and in doing that, he really

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:10.000
has defined a totally new path from athlete
to entrepreneur that I think is really inspiring.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.520
Seeing the way that he dives into the details,
seeing the way that he pushes himself to grow

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.130
and get better, that he looks at competition
as a way to actually feel the pressure, and

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.710
to deal with his mind.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.779
That is the thing I find so fascinating about
him is he understands what he's doing with

00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:26.930
his mind.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:30.839
That's the reason that I think he's going
to become an incredible entrepreneur, and

00:44:30.839 --> 00:44:35.160
he's going to have an even more impactful
career as an entrepreneur.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.740
Be sure to go check him out.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.741
He's going to blow you away.

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:38.741
It's absolutely incredible.

00:44:38.741 --> 00:44:42.710

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:56.690
