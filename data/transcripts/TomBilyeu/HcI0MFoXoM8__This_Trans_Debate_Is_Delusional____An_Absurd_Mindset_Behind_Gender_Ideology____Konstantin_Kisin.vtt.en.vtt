old that feels um slight of hand so I'm
going<00:08:18.879><c> to</c><00:08:19.000><c> set</c><00:08:19.159><c> that</c><00:08:19.319><c> aside</c><00:08:19.520><c> for</c><00:08:19.639><c> a</c><00:08:19.840><c> second</c><00:08:20.840><c> uh</c>

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to set that aside for a second uh
 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.070 align:start position:0%
going to set that aside for a second uh
so<00:08:21.159><c> I'm</c><00:08:21.280><c> introducing</c><00:08:21.720><c> a</c><00:08:21.840><c> new</c><00:08:22.080><c> idea</c><00:08:22.560><c> to</c><00:08:22.800><c> this</c>

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm introducing a new idea to this
 

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.990 align:start position:0%
so I'm introducing a new idea to this
discussion<00:08:23.520><c> or</c><00:08:23.680><c> trying</c><00:08:23.919><c> to</c><00:08:24.759><c> which</c><00:08:24.919><c> is</c><00:08:25.280><c> that</c><00:08:26.000><c> um</c>

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
discussion or trying to which is that um
 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.589 align:start position:0%
discussion or trying to which is that um
I<00:08:27.199><c> think</c><00:08:27.479><c> that</c><00:08:27.680><c> there</c><00:08:28.039><c> is</c><00:08:28.840><c> there</c><00:08:29.000><c> is</c><00:08:29.360><c> something</c>

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
I think that there is there is something
 

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:32.110 align:start position:0%
I think that there is there is something
to<00:08:29.759><c> be</c><00:08:29.919><c> said</c><00:08:30.319><c> about</c><00:08:31.000><c> being</c><00:08:31.240><c> nudged</c><00:08:32.000><c> and</c>

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
to be said about being nudged and
 

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.949 align:start position:0%
to be said about being nudged and
there's<00:08:32.279><c> a</c><00:08:32.440><c> malleability</c><00:08:33.200><c> in</c><00:08:33.360><c> here</c><00:08:33.760><c> and</c><00:08:33.880><c> if</c>

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
there's a malleability in here and if
 

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:35.310 align:start position:0%
there's a malleability in here and if
we're<00:08:34.159><c> not</c><00:08:34.360><c> being</c><00:08:34.640><c> honest</c><00:08:35.000><c> about</c><00:08:35.200><c> the</c>

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
we're not being honest about the
 

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.110 align:start position:0%
we're not being honest about the

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
malleability we won't understand why
 

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.750 align:start position:0%
malleability we won't understand why
it's<00:08:37.320><c> important</c><00:08:37.599><c> to</c><00:08:37.719><c> get</c><00:08:37.800><c> the</c><00:08:37.959><c> categorization</c>

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to get the categorization
 

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.110 align:start position:0%
it's important to get the categorization
right<00:08:39.719><c> because</c><00:08:40.279><c> I'm</c><00:08:40.440><c> saying</c><00:08:40.719><c> that</c><00:08:40.919><c> there</c><00:08:41.159><c> is</c><00:08:41.360><c> a</c>
