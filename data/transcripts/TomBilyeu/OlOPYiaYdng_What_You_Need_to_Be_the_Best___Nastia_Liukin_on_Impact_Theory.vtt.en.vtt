kind of made me believe that this is
possible<00:04:37.160><c> you</c><00:04:37.580><c> know</c><00:04:37.700><c> it</c><00:04:37.790><c> is</c><00:04:37.970><c> possible</c><00:04:38.420><c> for</c><00:04:38.540><c> an</c>

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 align:start position:0%
possible you know it is possible for an
 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.510 align:start position:0%
possible you know it is possible for an
American<00:04:39.020><c> gymnast</c><00:04:39.320><c> to</c><00:04:39.410><c> do</c><00:04:39.530><c> that</c>

the<00:08:40.790><c> Olympic</c><00:08:41.150><c> team</c><00:08:41.180><c> and</c><00:08:41.660><c> so</c><00:08:42.500><c> we</c><00:08:42.590><c> have</c><00:08:42.710><c> four</c>

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
the Olympic team and so we have four
 

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
the Olympic team and so we have four
events<00:08:43.280><c> we</c><00:08:43.880><c> compete</c><00:08:44.240><c> two</c><00:08:44.510><c> days</c><00:08:44.690><c> in</c><00:08:45.530><c> a</c><00:08:45.650><c> row</c><00:08:45.830><c> so</c>

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.130 align:start position:0%
events we compete two days in a row so
 

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
events we compete two days in a row so
that<00:08:46.280><c> means</c><00:08:46.460><c> eight</c><00:08:46.700><c> events</c><00:08:47.150><c> eight</c><00:08:47.330><c> routines</c>

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:47.690 align:start position:0%
that means eight events eight routines
 

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
that means eight events eight routines
and<00:08:47.990><c> out</c><00:08:48.440><c> of</c><00:08:48.530><c> those</c><00:08:48.620><c> eight</c><00:08:48.800><c> routines</c><00:08:49.100><c> I</c><00:08:49.250><c> fell</c>

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
and out of those eight routines I fell
 

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.530 align:start position:0%
and out of those eight routines I fell
six<00:08:49.820><c> times</c>

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:50.540 align:start position:0%
six times
 

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.750 align:start position:0%
six times
and<00:08:51.290><c> so</c><00:08:51.590><c> here</c><00:08:51.830><c> I</c><00:08:51.860><c> am</c><00:08:51.980><c> the</c><00:08:52.250><c> year</c><00:08:52.370><c> before</c><00:08:52.490><c> the</c>

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
and so here I am the year before the
 

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.190 align:start position:0%
and so here I am the year before the

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:57.980 align:start position:0%

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.910 align:start position:0%

so<00:08:58.100><c> I</c><00:08:58.340><c> guess</c><00:08:58.550><c> looking</c><00:08:59.330><c> back</c><00:08:59.690><c> at</c><00:08:59.960><c> it</c><00:08:59.990><c> I</c><00:09:00.320><c> can</c><00:09:00.590><c> see</c>

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess looking back at it I can see
 

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
so I guess looking back at it I can see
why<00:09:01.160><c> so</c><00:09:01.490><c> many</c><00:09:01.640><c> people</c><00:09:01.850><c> started</c><00:09:02.720><c> doubting</c><00:09:03.050><c> me</c>

Olympic<00:09:26.750><c> team</c><00:09:26.900><c> and</c><00:09:26.930><c> so</c><00:09:27.290><c> I</c><00:09:27.320><c> think</c><00:09:27.440><c> that</c><00:09:27.740><c> was</c>

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:28.430 align:start position:0%
Olympic team and so I think that was
 

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.430 align:start position:0%
Olympic team and so I think that was
really<00:09:28.760><c> the</c><00:09:29.240><c> first</c><00:09:29.450><c> time</c><00:09:29.720><c> in</c><00:09:29.870><c> my</c><00:09:29.960><c> life</c><00:09:30.170><c> where</c><00:09:30.410><c> I</c>

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.270 align:start position:0%
realized how difficult it was to not
 

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.180 align:start position:0%
realized how difficult it was to not
only<00:09:35.480><c> be</c><00:09:35.840><c> somewhat</c><00:09:36.290><c> in</c><00:09:36.410><c> the</c><00:09:36.500><c> spotlight</c><00:09:36.920><c> but</c>

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
only be somewhat in the spotlight but
 

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.100 align:start position:0%
only be somewhat in the spotlight but
then<00:09:37.340><c> have</c><00:09:37.580><c> people</c><00:09:37.610><c> not</c><00:09:38.240><c> believe</c><00:09:38.600><c> in</c><00:09:38.750><c> you</c><00:09:38.900><c> and</c>

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
then have people not believe in you and
 

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.620 align:start position:0%
then have people not believe in you and
so<00:09:39.230><c> I</c><00:09:39.260><c> kind</c><00:09:39.590><c> of</c><00:09:39.680><c> started</c><00:09:40.310><c> relying</c><00:09:41.000><c> on</c><00:09:41.450><c> the</c>

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.850 align:start position:0%
competition together I was struggling

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
with the injury I was struggling with
 

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
with the injury I was struggling with
getting<00:11:59.310><c> back</c><00:11:59.550><c> to</c><00:11:59.790><c> full</c><00:12:00.000><c> strength</c><00:12:00.420><c> and</c><00:12:00.890><c> you</c>

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:01.890 align:start position:0%
getting back to full strength and you
 

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.140 align:start position:0%
getting back to full strength and you
know<00:12:01.980><c> not</c><00:12:02.160><c> just</c><00:12:02.190><c> strength</c><00:12:02.670><c> but</c><00:12:02.880><c> get</c><00:12:03.060><c> my</c>

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:03.150 align:start position:0%
know not just strength but get my
 

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
know not just strength but get my
routines<00:12:03.540><c> back</c><00:12:03.840><c> and</c><00:12:04.170><c> then</c><00:12:04.380><c> trying</c><00:12:04.710><c> to</c><00:12:04.890><c> upgrade</c>

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
routines back and then trying to upgrade
 

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.950 align:start position:0%
routines back and then trying to upgrade
my<00:12:05.490><c> routines</c><00:12:05.910><c> so</c><00:12:06.180><c> I</c><00:12:06.210><c> could</c><00:12:06.570><c> have</c><00:12:06.750><c> these</c>

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
my routines so I could have these
 

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.300 align:start position:0%
my routines so I could have these
difficult<00:12:07.380><c> routines</c><00:12:07.680><c> that</c><00:12:07.770><c> I</c><00:12:07.890><c> could</c><00:12:08.160><c> be</c>

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:08.310 align:start position:0%
difficult routines that I could be
 

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.650 align:start position:0%
difficult routines that I could be
competitive<00:12:08.820><c> with</c><00:12:08.970><c> the</c><00:12:09.120><c> rest</c><00:12:09.300><c> of</c><00:12:09.420><c> the</c><00:12:09.510><c> world</c>

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
competitive with the rest of the world
 

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
competitive with the rest of the world
so<00:12:09.960><c> it</c><00:12:10.020><c> was</c><00:12:10.110><c> like</c><00:12:10.260><c> this</c><00:12:10.770><c> like</c><00:12:11.070><c> chain</c><00:12:11.460><c> of</c><00:12:11.790><c> you</c>

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:12.090 align:start position:0%
so it was like this like chain of you
 

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
so it was like this like chain of you
know<00:12:12.180><c> events</c><00:12:13.170><c> basically</c><00:12:13.770><c> that</c><00:12:14.010><c> I</c><00:12:14.370><c> was</c><00:12:14.820><c> trying</c>

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.210 align:start position:0%
know events basically that I was trying
 

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
know events basically that I was trying
to<00:12:15.330><c> get</c><00:12:15.570><c> stronger</c><00:12:15.930><c> in</c><00:12:16.260><c> all</c><00:12:16.470><c> aspects</c><00:12:17.040><c> of</c><00:12:17.190><c> that</c>

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.370 align:start position:0%
to get stronger in all aspects of that
 

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.020 align:start position:0%
to get stronger in all aspects of that
and<00:12:17.640><c> so</c><00:12:17.880><c> I</c><00:12:18.530><c> think</c><00:12:19.530><c> it</c><00:12:19.890><c> was</c><00:12:20.010><c> just</c><00:12:20.340><c> this</c><00:12:20.520><c> turning</c>

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
and so I think it was just this turning
 

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
and so I think it was just this turning
point<00:12:21.330><c> in</c><00:12:21.630><c> when</c><00:12:22.230><c> it</c><00:12:22.350><c> hit</c><00:12:22.650><c> 2008</c><00:12:23.340><c> where</c><00:12:23.520><c> I</c><00:12:23.550><c> was</c>

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
point in when it hit 2008 where I was
 

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
point in when it hit 2008 where I was
kind<00:12:24.000><c> of</c><00:12:24.060><c> like</c><00:12:24.240><c> you</c><00:12:24.390><c> know</c><00:12:24.420><c> what</c><00:12:24.660><c> like</c><00:12:24.990><c> okay</c>

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know what like okay
 

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.860 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know what like okay
this<00:12:25.980><c> is</c><00:12:26.220><c> it's</c><00:12:26.580><c> it's</c><00:12:26.820><c> either</c><00:12:27.030><c> it's</c><00:12:27.450><c> it's</c><00:12:27.750><c> all</c>

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:27.870 align:start position:0%
this is it's it's either it's it's all
 

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
this is it's it's either it's it's all
or<00:12:28.020><c> nothing</c><00:12:28.320><c> at</c><00:12:28.500><c> this</c><00:12:28.710><c> point</c><00:12:29.010><c> because</c><00:12:29.220><c> I</c><00:12:29.670><c> just</c>

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:30.450 align:start position:0%
or nothing at this point because I just
 

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
or nothing at this point because I just
trained<00:12:30.780><c> for</c><00:12:31.170><c> almost</c><00:12:31.410><c> 18</c><00:12:31.830><c> years</c><00:12:31.860><c> in</c><00:12:32.130><c> my</c><00:12:32.220><c> life</c>

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.250 align:start position:0%
trained for almost 18 years in my life
 

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.490 align:start position:0%
trained for almost 18 years in my life
for<00:12:32.670><c> this</c><00:12:32.760><c> one</c><00:12:32.820><c> moment</c><00:12:33.450><c> so</c><00:12:33.750><c> it's</c><00:12:33.930><c> like</c><00:12:34.110><c> why</c>

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
for this one moment so it's like why

there if you touch someone and they

still grab the bar that's a point
 

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.499 align:start position:0%
still grab the bar that's a point
deduction<00:26:49.590><c> so</c><00:26:50.039><c> it's</c><00:26:50.159><c> the</c><00:26:50.279><c> same</c><00:26:50.519><c> as</c><00:26:50.759><c> a</c><00:26:50.789><c> fall</c><00:26:51.149><c> and</c>

00:26:51.499 --> 00:26:51.509 align:start position:0%
deduction so it's the same as a fall and
 

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:54.139 align:start position:0%
deduction so it's the same as a fall and
so<00:26:51.720><c> in</c><00:26:51.960><c> his</c><00:26:52.409><c> mind</c><00:26:52.710><c> he's</c><00:26:52.950><c> thinking</c><00:26:53.429><c> like</c><00:26:53.460><c> is</c><00:26:53.879><c> she</c>

00:26:54.139 --> 00:26:54.149 align:start position:0%
so in his mind he's thinking like is she
 

00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:55.700 align:start position:0%
so in his mind he's thinking like is she
gonna<00:26:54.269><c> catch</c><00:26:54.509><c> it</c><00:26:54.659><c> is</c><00:26:54.749><c> she</c><00:26:54.899><c> not</c><00:26:55.049><c> he's</c><00:26:55.379><c> kind</c><00:26:55.649><c> of</c>

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:55.710 align:start position:0%
gonna catch it is she not he's kind of
 

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.349 align:start position:0%
gonna catch it is she not he's kind of

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
going like this back and forth motion
 

00:26:57.359 --> 00:26:59.330 align:start position:0%
going like this back and forth motion
and<00:26:57.929><c> then</c><00:26:58.409><c> all</c><00:26:58.529><c> of</c><00:26:58.559><c> a</c><00:26:58.649><c> sudden</c><00:26:58.679><c> I'm</c><00:26:58.950><c> like</c><00:26:58.980><c> on</c><00:26:59.309><c> the</c>

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
fall and so I knew that I just had to
 

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
fall and so I knew that I just had to
stay<00:27:06.240><c> completely</c><00:27:06.809><c> flat</c><00:27:07.109><c> and</c><00:27:07.499><c> like</c><00:27:07.679><c> fall</c><00:27:08.009><c> like</c>

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
of course he knew that but I think that
 

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.139 align:start position:0%
of course he knew that but I think that
dad<00:27:34.350><c> and</c><00:27:34.379><c> him</c><00:27:34.859><c> just</c><00:27:34.889><c> wanted</c><00:27:35.639><c> me</c><00:27:35.730><c> to</c><00:27:35.759><c> get</c><00:27:36.029><c> off</c>
