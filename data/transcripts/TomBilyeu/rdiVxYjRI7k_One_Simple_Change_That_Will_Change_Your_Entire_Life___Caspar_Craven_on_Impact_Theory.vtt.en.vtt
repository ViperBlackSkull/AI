00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
started with the intentionality of
 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
started with the intentionality of
sitting<00:04:13.760><c> down</c>

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
sitting down
 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
sitting down
with<00:04:14.720><c> my</c><00:04:14.879><c> wife</c><00:04:15.200><c> and</c><00:04:15.360><c> we</c><00:04:15.680><c> spend</c><00:04:15.920><c> a</c><00:04:15.920><c> lot</c><00:04:16.079><c> of</c><00:04:16.239><c> time</c>

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
with my wife and we spend a lot of time
 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
with my wife and we spend a lot of time
listening<00:04:17.120><c> to</c><00:04:17.359><c> each</c><00:04:17.519><c> other</c><00:04:17.680><c> and</c><00:04:17.759><c> saying</c>

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
listening to each other and saying
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.990 align:start position:0%
listening to each other and saying
what's<00:04:18.320><c> really</c><00:04:18.639><c> important</c><00:04:19.120><c> to</c><00:04:19.280><c> you</c>

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
what's really important to you
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.670 align:start position:0%
what's really important to you
and<00:04:20.239><c> we</c><00:04:20.400><c> created</c><00:04:20.720><c> these</c><00:04:20.959><c> two</c><00:04:21.120><c> different</c><00:04:21.359><c> lists</c>

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
and we created these two different lists
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.110 align:start position:0%
and we created these two different lists
so<00:04:21.840><c> i</c><00:04:21.919><c> visualize</c><00:04:22.400><c> it</c><00:04:22.560><c> like</c><00:04:22.720><c> here's</c><00:04:22.960><c> all</c><00:04:23.040><c> the</c>

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i visualize it like here's all the
 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
so i visualize it like here's all the
things<00:04:23.360><c> that</c><00:04:23.520><c> was</c><00:04:23.680><c> important</c><00:04:24.080><c> to</c><00:04:24.160><c> me</c><00:04:24.880><c> and</c><00:04:25.040><c> here</c>

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
things that was important to me and here
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.430 align:start position:0%
things that was important to me and here
all<00:04:25.440><c> the</c><00:04:25.520><c> things</c><00:04:25.759><c> are</c><00:04:25.919><c> important</c><00:04:26.240><c> to</c><00:04:26.400><c> my</c><00:04:26.560><c> wife</c>

all the things are important to my wife
 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
all the things are important to my wife
and<00:04:27.520><c> we</c><00:04:27.680><c> just</c><00:04:28.000><c> found</c><00:04:28.320><c> where</c><00:04:28.479><c> there</c><00:04:28.639><c> were</c>

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
and we just found where there were
 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.550 align:start position:0%
and we just found where there were
things<00:04:28.960><c> that</c><00:04:29.120><c> were</c><00:04:29.600><c> that</c><00:04:29.840><c> crossed</c><00:04:30.240><c> over</c><00:04:30.400><c> we</c>

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
things that were that crossed over we
 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.550 align:start position:0%
things that were that crossed over we
had<00:04:30.639><c> an</c><00:04:30.720><c> intersection</c><00:04:31.600><c> which</c><00:04:31.840><c> is</c><00:04:32.000><c> my</c><00:04:32.240><c> thumbs</c>

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
had an intersection which is my thumbs
 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.110 align:start position:0%
had an intersection which is my thumbs
here<00:04:33.199><c> the</c><00:04:33.360><c> rest</c><00:04:33.600><c> of</c><00:04:33.759><c> it</c><00:04:33.840><c> we</c><00:04:34.000><c> dropped</c><00:04:34.880><c> and</c><00:04:34.960><c> we</c>

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
here the rest of it we dropped and we
 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
here the rest of it we dropped and we
just<00:04:35.440><c> focused</c><00:04:35.840><c> on</c><00:04:36.000><c> those</c><00:04:36.639><c> few</c><00:04:36.960><c> things</c><00:04:37.280><c> that</c><00:04:37.360><c> we</c>

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
just focused on those few things that we
 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.510 align:start position:0%
just focused on those few things that we
had<00:04:37.680><c> in</c><00:04:37.840><c> common</c><00:04:38.479><c> and</c><00:04:38.639><c> then</c><00:04:38.800><c> we</c><00:04:38.880><c> just</c><00:04:39.040><c> created</c><00:04:39.440><c> a</c>

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
had in common and then we just created a
 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
had in common and then we just created a
different<00:04:39.759><c> narrative</c><00:04:40.320><c> of</c><00:04:40.479><c> the</c><00:04:40.560><c> future</c><00:04:41.440><c> which</c>

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
different narrative of the future which
 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start position:0%
different narrative of the future which
was<00:04:41.919><c> all</c><00:04:42.080><c> around</c><00:04:42.639><c> only</c><00:04:42.960><c> those</c><00:04:43.199><c> things</c><00:04:43.440><c> that</c><00:04:43.600><c> we</c>

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
was all around only those things that we
 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
was all around only those things that we
shared<00:04:44.000><c> in</c><00:04:44.080><c> common</c><00:04:44.800><c> and</c><00:04:44.960><c> that</c><00:04:45.120><c> was</c><00:04:45.280><c> kind</c><00:04:45.440><c> of</c>

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
shared in common and that was kind of
 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.189 align:start position:0%
shared in common and that was kind of
that<00:04:45.919><c> that</c><00:04:46.080><c> was</c><00:04:46.240><c> where</c><00:04:46.479><c> it</c><00:04:46.560><c> sort</c><00:04:46.720><c> of</c><00:04:46.880><c> really</c>

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
that that was where it sort of really
 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.110 align:start position:0%
that that was where it sort of really
started<00:04:47.440><c> to</c><00:04:47.600><c> come</c><00:04:47.840><c> to</c><00:04:48.000><c> life</c><00:04:48.639><c> because</c><00:04:48.880><c> when</c><00:04:49.040><c> you</c>

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
started to come to life because when you
 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.189 align:start position:0%
started to come to life because when you
talk<00:04:49.360><c> about</c><00:04:49.600><c> things</c><00:04:49.919><c> that</c><00:04:50.160><c> excite</c><00:04:50.800><c> both</c><00:04:51.040><c> of</c>

talk about things that excite both of

talk about things that excite both of

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
you
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.310 align:start position:0%
you
then<00:04:52.720><c> that</c><00:04:52.960><c> creates</c><00:04:53.360><c> energy</c><00:04:53.759><c> whereas</c><00:04:54.000><c> before</c>

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
then that creates energy whereas before
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
then that creates energy whereas before
i've<00:04:54.479><c> been</c><00:04:54.560><c> saying</c><00:04:54.800><c> i</c><00:04:54.880><c> want</c><00:04:55.040><c> to</c><00:04:55.120><c> do</c><00:04:55.199><c> this</c>

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
i've been saying i want to do this
 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.110 align:start position:0%
i've been saying i want to do this
nikola<00:04:55.840><c> was</c><00:04:55.919><c> saying</c><00:04:56.080><c> so</c><00:04:56.240><c> you</c><00:04:56.320><c> want</c><00:04:56.400><c> to</c><00:04:56.479><c> do</c><00:04:56.639><c> this</c>

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
nikola was saying so you want to do this
 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.830 align:start position:0%
nikola was saying so you want to do this
and<00:04:57.199><c> you</c><00:04:57.360><c> just</c><00:04:57.680><c> end</c><00:04:57.919><c> up</c><00:04:58.320><c> clashing</c>

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and you just end up clashing
 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
and you just end up clashing
so<00:05:00.000><c> it</c><00:05:00.160><c> all</c><00:05:00.320><c> came</c><00:05:00.560><c> with</c><00:05:00.960><c> creating</c><00:05:01.360><c> a</c><00:05:01.440><c> different</c>

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
so it all came with creating a different
 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.670 align:start position:0%
so it all came with creating a different
story<00:05:02.000><c> of</c><00:05:02.080><c> the</c><00:05:02.160><c> future</c><00:05:02.479><c> basically</c><00:05:03.360><c> one</c><00:05:03.520><c> thing</c>

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.950 align:start position:0%

by<00:06:06.720><c> really</c><00:06:07.039><c> listening</c><00:06:07.520><c> to</c><00:06:07.759><c> what</c><00:06:07.919><c> was</c><00:06:08.080><c> going</c><00:06:08.400><c> on</c>

by really listening to what was going on
 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.309 align:start position:0%
by really listening to what was going on
so<00:06:09.120><c> i</c><00:06:09.199><c> think</c><00:06:09.360><c> that's</c><00:06:09.600><c> where</c><00:06:09.759><c> it</c><00:06:09.919><c> started</c><00:06:10.240><c> with</c>

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that's where it started with
 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
so i think that's where it started with
the<00:06:10.400><c> listening</c><00:06:10.800><c> piece</c><00:06:11.520><c> deep</c><00:06:11.919><c> listening</c><00:06:12.400><c> that</c>

and
 

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:10.230 align:start position:0%
and
we<00:12:09.120><c> had</c><00:12:09.200><c> to</c><00:12:09.279><c> figure</c><00:12:09.600><c> out</c><00:12:09.680><c> a</c><00:12:09.760><c> way</c><00:12:09.920><c> to</c><00:12:10.079><c> get</c>

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
we had to figure out a way to get

we had to figure out a way to get

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%

these values
 

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
these values
and<00:18:39.520><c> then</c><00:18:39.679><c> we</c><00:18:39.760><c> distilled</c><00:18:40.160><c> it</c><00:18:40.320><c> down</c><00:18:40.480><c> to</c><00:18:40.640><c> a</c>

and then we distilled it down to a
 

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.390 align:start position:0%
and then we distilled it down to a

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
shorter list and then it came down to
 

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.310 align:start position:0%
shorter list and then it came down to
six<00:18:42.720><c> values</c>

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
six values
 

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.470 align:start position:0%
six values
we<00:18:44.559><c> created</c><00:18:44.960><c> a</c><00:18:45.039><c> picture</c><00:18:45.600><c> to</c><00:18:45.840><c> symbolize</c><00:18:46.400><c> all</c>

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
we created a picture to symbolize all
 

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.310 align:start position:0%
we created a picture to symbolize all
the<00:18:46.559><c> values</c><00:18:46.880><c> so</c><00:18:47.039><c> it's</c><00:18:47.120><c> a</c><00:18:47.200><c> picture</c><00:18:47.440><c> of</c><00:18:47.600><c> a</c><00:18:47.679><c> lion</c>

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
the values so it's a picture of a lion
 

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.710 align:start position:0%
the values so it's a picture of a lion
so<00:18:48.559><c> courage</c><00:18:48.960><c> was</c><00:18:49.120><c> one</c><00:18:49.280><c> of</c><00:18:49.440><c> the</c><00:18:49.600><c> core</c><00:18:49.840><c> values</c>

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%

but we also spent a lot of time saying
 

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
but we also spent a lot of time saying

was always still five years away and so
 

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
was always still five years away and so
the<00:23:43.520><c> essence</c><00:23:43.919><c> of</c><00:23:44.000><c> that</c><00:23:44.240><c> is</c><00:23:44.799><c> putting</c><00:23:45.039><c> that</c><00:23:45.280><c> date</c>

the essence of that is putting that date

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the diary and making that firm
 

00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
in the diary and making that firm
decision

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
decision
that<00:23:49.280><c> is</c><00:23:49.440><c> going</c><00:23:49.520><c> to</c><00:23:49.600><c> happen</c>

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
that is going to happen
 

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.470 align:start position:0%
that is going to happen
and<00:23:50.640><c> there's</c><00:23:50.880><c> no</c><00:23:51.039><c> two</c><00:23:51.200><c> ways</c><00:23:51.440><c> about</c><00:23:51.679><c> it</c>

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
and there's no two ways about it
 

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.190 align:start position:0%
and there's no two ways about it
so

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.710 align:start position:0%
so
that's<00:23:53.600><c> that</c><00:23:53.919><c> that</c><00:23:54.080><c> was</c><00:23:54.240><c> literally</c><00:23:54.480><c> the</c><00:23:54.559><c> thing</c>

00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
example of this is this whole thing of
 

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:44.710 align:start position:0%
example of this is this whole thing of
family<00:32:43.760><c> first</c>

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
family first
 

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.630 align:start position:0%
family first
that<00:32:44.880><c> was</c><00:32:45.120><c> our</c><00:32:45.279><c> first</c><00:32:45.600><c> piece</c><00:32:45.919><c> of</c><00:32:46.080><c> breakthrough</c>

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
that was our first piece of breakthrough
 

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.789 align:start position:0%
that was our first piece of breakthrough
thinking<00:32:47.440><c> because</c><00:32:47.760><c> before</c><00:32:48.240><c> it</c><00:32:48.399><c> had</c><00:32:48.480><c> always</c>

00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
thinking because before it had always
 

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:52.070 align:start position:0%
thinking because before it had always
been<00:32:49.440><c> business</c><00:32:50.000><c> first</c><00:32:50.720><c> make</c><00:32:51.039><c> money</c><00:32:51.679><c> then</c><00:32:51.919><c> go</c>

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
been business first make money then go
 

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
been business first make money then go
and<00:32:52.159><c> do</c><00:32:52.320><c> family</c><00:32:52.799><c> stuff</c><00:32:53.440><c> and</c><00:32:53.600><c> it</c><00:32:53.679><c> was</c><00:32:53.840><c> literally</c>

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
and do family stuff and it was literally
 

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.230 align:start position:0%
and do family stuff and it was literally
turning<00:32:54.559><c> life</c><00:32:54.799><c> on</c><00:32:54.960><c> its</c><00:32:55.200><c> head</c><00:32:55.760><c> and</c><00:32:55.919><c> saying</c>

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
turning life on its head and saying
 

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.789 align:start position:0%
turning life on its head and saying
family<00:32:56.640><c> first</c><00:32:57.519><c> so</c><00:32:57.679><c> for</c><00:32:57.840><c> me</c><00:32:58.000><c> that's</c><00:32:58.320><c> an</c><00:32:58.480><c> example</c>

00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
family first so for me that's an example
 

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:01.350 align:start position:0%
family first so for me that's an example
of<00:32:59.200><c> breakthrough</c><00:32:59.919><c> thinking</c><00:33:00.640><c> it</c><00:33:00.799><c> just</c><00:33:01.120><c> yeah</c>

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
