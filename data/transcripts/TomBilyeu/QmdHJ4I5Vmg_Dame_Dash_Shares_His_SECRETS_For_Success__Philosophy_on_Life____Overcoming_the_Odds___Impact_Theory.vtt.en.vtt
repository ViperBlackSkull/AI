00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
brain which is powerful and i visualize
 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.950 align:start position:0%
brain which is powerful and i visualize
exactly<00:04:53.600><c> what</c><00:04:53.759><c> i</c><00:04:53.919><c> want</c>

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what i want
 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.189 align:start position:0%

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm there i'm in my future and then i
 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.110 align:start position:0%
so i'm there i'm in my future and then i

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
do to make that happen
 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.870 align:start position:0%

and<00:05:01.120><c> every</c><00:05:01.360><c> single</c><00:05:01.759><c> thing</c><00:05:02.160><c> that</c><00:05:02.400><c> could</c><00:05:02.560><c> stop</c>

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
and every single thing that could stop
 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
and every single thing that could stop
that<00:05:03.040><c> from</c><00:05:03.199><c> happening</c><00:05:03.520><c> and</c><00:05:03.600><c> what</c><00:05:03.759><c> i</c><00:05:03.840><c> need</c><00:05:04.000><c> to</c>

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
that from happening and what i need to
 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.230 align:start position:0%
that from happening and what i need to
avoid<00:05:04.720><c> then</c><00:05:04.880><c> i</c><00:05:04.960><c> go</c><00:05:05.120><c> right</c><00:05:05.360><c> back</c>

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
avoid then i go right back
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
avoid then i go right back
you<00:05:06.400><c> understand</c><00:05:06.720><c> what</c><00:05:06.800><c> i'm</c><00:05:06.880><c> saying</c><00:05:07.360><c> like</c><00:05:07.600><c> i</c>

you understand what i'm saying like i
 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.909 align:start position:0%
you understand what i'm saying like i
was<00:05:07.840><c> just</c><00:05:08.240><c> in</c><00:05:08.320><c> the</c><00:05:08.479><c> future</c><00:05:09.280><c> thinking</c><00:05:09.600><c> about</c>

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
was just in the future thinking about
 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.870 align:start position:0%
was just in the future thinking about
watching<00:05:10.320><c> myself</c><00:05:10.960><c> on</c><00:05:11.120><c> my</c><00:05:11.360><c> television</c><00:05:11.840><c> network</c>

watching myself on my television network
 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.590 align:start position:0%
watching myself on my television network
so

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
so
because<00:05:14.000><c> i</c><00:05:14.160><c> do</c><00:05:14.320><c> that</c><00:05:14.560><c> that</c><00:05:14.720><c> means</c><00:05:15.039><c> i</c><00:05:15.120><c> have</c><00:05:15.280><c> to</c>

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
because i do that that means i have to
 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
because i do that that means i have to
think

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
think
 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
think
what<00:05:17.199><c> would</c><00:05:17.360><c> be</c><00:05:17.520><c> the</c><00:05:17.680><c> worst</c><00:05:17.919><c> case</c><00:05:18.160><c> scenario</c>

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
what would be the worst case scenario
 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.029 align:start position:0%
what would be the worst case scenario
and<00:05:19.840><c> then</c><00:05:20.000><c> i</c><00:05:20.000><c> have</c><00:05:20.160><c> to</c><00:05:20.320><c> think</c><00:05:20.560><c> what</c><00:05:20.720><c> would</c><00:05:20.880><c> be</c>

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
and then i have to think what would be
 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
and then i have to think what would be
the<00:05:21.120><c> best</c><00:05:21.520><c> case</c><00:05:21.759><c> scenario</c><00:05:22.720><c> and</c><00:05:22.800><c> then</c><00:05:23.039><c> i</c>

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario and then i
 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.590 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario and then i
eliminate<00:05:23.919><c> every</c><00:05:24.240><c> single</c><00:05:24.639><c> thing</c><00:05:25.199><c> that</c><00:05:25.360><c> i</c>

eliminate every single thing that i
 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
eliminate every single thing that i

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
think could happen which i call
 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
