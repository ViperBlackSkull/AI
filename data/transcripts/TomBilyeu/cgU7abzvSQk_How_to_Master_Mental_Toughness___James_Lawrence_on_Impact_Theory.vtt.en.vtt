00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
feel like now it was like a bug that bit
me<00:08:46.890><c> and</c><00:08:46.920><c> it</c><00:08:47.100><c> just</c><00:08:47.280><c> sort</c><00:08:47.460><c> of</c><00:08:47.610><c> took</c><00:08:47.700><c> over</c><00:08:47.850><c> I</c><00:08:48.180><c> think</c>

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:48.810 align:start position:0%
me and it just sort of took over I think
 

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.650 align:start position:0%
me and it just sort of took over I think
there's<00:08:48.960><c> a</c><00:08:49.020><c> little</c><00:08:49.530><c> bit</c><00:08:49.860><c> of</c><00:08:50.130><c> both</c><00:08:50.430><c> because</c>

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of both because
 

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of both because
I<00:08:51.720><c> really</c><00:08:52.379><c> gravitated</c><00:08:53.009><c> towards</c><00:08:53.370><c> the</c><00:08:53.490><c> cycling</c>

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:54.649 align:start position:0%
I really gravitated towards the cycling
 

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:58.490 align:start position:0%
I really gravitated towards the cycling
and<00:08:55.649><c> the</c><00:08:56.579><c> swimming</c><00:08:57.029><c> was</c><00:08:57.420><c> a</c><00:08:57.449><c> challenge</c><00:08:58.079><c> for</c><00:08:58.350><c> me</c>

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
and the swimming was a challenge for me
 

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
and the swimming was a challenge for me
and<00:08:58.709><c> the</c><00:08:59.430><c> running</c><00:08:59.759><c> in</c><00:08:59.910><c> in</c><00:09:00.120><c> a</c><00:09:00.240><c> sprint</c>

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and the running in in a sprint
 

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.230 align:start position:0%
and the running in in a sprint
triathlons<00:09:00.959><c> only</c><00:09:01.170><c> 5k</c><00:09:01.529><c> and</c><00:09:02.190><c> it's</c><00:09:02.730><c> it's</c><00:09:03.029><c> more</c>

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
triathlons only 5k and it's it's more
 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
triathlons only 5k and it's it's more
speed<00:09:03.720><c> and</c><00:09:03.930><c> explosiveness</c><00:09:04.170><c> which</c><00:09:05.009><c> was</c><00:09:05.190><c> fun</c>

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.490 align:start position:0%
speed and explosiveness which was fun
 

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
speed and explosiveness which was fun
because<00:09:05.699><c> I</c><00:09:05.850><c> was</c><00:09:06.240><c> you</c><00:09:06.810><c> know</c><00:09:06.839><c> from</c><00:09:07.199><c> wrestling</c>

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
because I was you know from wrestling
 

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.980 align:start position:0%
because I was you know from wrestling
it's<00:09:07.889><c> its</c><00:09:08.310><c> endurance</c><00:09:08.759><c> but</c><00:09:09.029><c> its</c><00:09:09.149><c> strength</c><00:09:09.629><c> and</c>

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
it's its endurance but its strength and
 

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
it's its endurance but its strength and
speed<00:09:10.350><c> and</c><00:09:10.740><c> so</c><00:09:11.699><c> that</c><00:09:11.850><c> was</c><00:09:11.970><c> kind</c><00:09:12.029><c> of</c><00:09:12.209><c> my</c>

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:12.329 align:start position:0%
speed and so that was kind of my
 

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:14.449 align:start position:0%
speed and so that was kind of my
background<00:09:12.629><c> and</c><00:09:13.050><c> to</c><00:09:13.259><c> have</c><00:09:13.680><c> the</c><00:09:13.829><c> early</c><00:09:14.069><c> success</c>

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
background and to have the early success

build<00:23:07.200><c> the</c><00:23:07.379><c> confidence</c><00:23:07.590><c> to</c><00:23:08.039><c> take</c><00:23:08.190><c> on</c><00:23:08.429><c> the</c><00:23:08.789><c> next</c>

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
build the confidence to take on the next
 

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.599 align:start position:0%
build the confidence to take on the next
the<00:23:09.330><c> next</c><00:23:09.479><c> the</c><00:23:09.690><c> next</c><00:23:09.809><c> and</c><00:23:10.349><c> so</c><00:23:10.379><c> it's</c><00:23:11.099><c> just</c><00:23:11.159><c> it</c>

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
have been the guy that said he was going
 

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.790 align:start position:0%
have been the guy that said he was going

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.830 align:start position:0%
to do 50 that did did 30 and it would
have<00:24:46.860><c> been</c><00:24:46.920><c> considered</c><00:24:47.340><c> a</c><00:24:47.520><c> failure</c><00:24:47.730><c> and</c><00:24:48.120><c> so</c><00:24:48.780><c> it</c>

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
have been considered a failure and so it
 

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
have been considered a failure and so it

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
was really really important to me to do
 

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.230 align:start position:0%
was really really important to me to do

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
whatever it took to do that and and I
 

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.420 align:start position:0%
whatever it took to do that and and I

that's small to get there you have to be
 

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's small to get there you have to be
you<00:27:58.330><c> have</c><00:27:58.360><c> to</c><00:27:58.630><c> know</c><00:27:58.990><c> that</c><00:27:59.230><c> it's</c><00:27:59.409><c> there</c><00:27:59.650><c> but</c><00:27:59.970><c> in</c>

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
order to achieve it you have to break it
 

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.810 align:start position:0%
order to achieve it you have to break it
down<00:28:02.590><c> because</c><00:28:02.799><c> it's</c><00:28:03.039><c> gonna</c><00:28:03.130><c> be</c><00:28:03.280><c> overwhelming</c>

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:03.820 align:start position:0%

a<00:35:27.750><c> lot</c><00:35:27.809><c> so</c><00:35:28.109><c> my</c><00:35:28.290><c> standard</c><00:35:28.770><c> of</c>

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
a lot so my standard of
 

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:33.009 align:start position:0%
a lot so my standard of
one<00:35:29.480><c> is</c><00:35:29.809><c> different</c><00:35:30.499><c> than</c><00:35:30.920><c> my</c><00:35:31.849><c> standard</c><00:35:32.299><c> at</c><00:35:32.390><c> 24</c>

00:35:33.009 --> 00:35:33.019 align:start position:0%
one is different than my standard at 24
 

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:35.589 align:start position:0%
one is different than my standard at 24
so<00:35:33.259><c> if</c><00:35:33.349><c> I'm</c><00:35:33.499><c> trying</c><00:35:34.160><c> to</c><00:35:34.400><c> hold</c><00:35:34.579><c> a</c><00:35:34.730><c> 24-year</c><00:35:35.450><c> old</c>

so if I'm trying to hold a 24-year old
 

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:38.980 align:start position:0%
so if I'm trying to hold a 24-year old

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
to my standard probably not realistic
