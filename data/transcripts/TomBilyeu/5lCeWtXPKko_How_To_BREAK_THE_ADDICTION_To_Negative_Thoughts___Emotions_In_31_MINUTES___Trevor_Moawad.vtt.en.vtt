yeah<00:03:04.319><c> um</c><00:03:04.720><c> and</c><00:03:04.800><c> then</c><00:03:04.959><c> of</c><00:03:05.120><c> course</c><00:03:05.440><c> there's</c>

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um and then of course there's
 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.509 align:start position:0%
yeah um and then of course there's
neutral<00:03:06.080><c> thinking</c><00:03:06.480><c> so</c><00:03:06.800><c> i</c><00:03:06.959><c> think</c><00:03:07.120><c> that's</c><00:03:07.360><c> sort</c>

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
neutral thinking so i think that's sort
 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.470 align:start position:0%

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
through yeah and and and then i think
 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.750 align:start position:0%
through yeah and and and then i think
probably<00:03:12.480><c> the</c><00:03:12.560><c> third</c><00:03:12.800><c> part</c><00:03:13.040><c> of</c><00:03:13.120><c> that</c><00:03:13.280><c> would</c><00:03:13.440><c> be</c>

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
probably the third part of that would be

georgetown and harvard that negativity
 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.189 align:start position:0%
georgetown and harvard that negativity
is<00:07:22.319><c> a</c><00:07:22.479><c> multiple</c><00:07:23.440><c> of</c><00:07:23.680><c> four</c><00:07:23.919><c> to</c><00:07:24.160><c> seven</c><00:07:24.479><c> times</c>

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
is a multiple of four to seven times
 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
is a multiple of four to seven times
more<00:07:25.440><c> powerful</c><00:07:26.240><c> than</c><00:07:26.479><c> positivity</c>

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
more powerful than positivity
 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.070 align:start position:0%
more powerful than positivity
so<00:07:28.479><c> think</c><00:07:28.720><c> about</c><00:07:28.960><c> that</c><00:07:29.199><c> if</c><00:07:29.360><c> i</c><00:07:29.440><c> say</c><00:07:29.680><c> something</c>

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
so think about that if i say something
 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
so think about that if i say something
out<00:07:30.240><c> loud</c><00:07:30.560><c> it's</c><00:07:30.800><c> 10x</c><00:07:31.680><c> if</c><00:07:31.840><c> it's</c><00:07:32.080><c> negative</c><00:07:32.720><c> it's</c>

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
out loud it's 10x if it's negative it's
 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.189 align:start position:0%
out loud it's 10x if it's negative it's
four<00:07:33.120><c> to</c><00:07:33.280><c> seven</c><00:07:33.599><c> times</c><00:07:33.919><c> more</c><00:07:34.160><c> powerful</c><00:07:34.960><c> so</c>

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
four to seven times more powerful so
 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.990 align:start position:0%
four to seven times more powerful so
when<00:07:35.440><c> i</c><00:07:35.680><c> say</c><00:07:36.000><c> negative</c><00:07:36.400><c> things</c><00:07:36.800><c> out</c><00:07:37.039><c> loud</c><00:07:37.599><c> it's</c>

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
automatically go forward
 

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.870 align:start position:0%

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
so it has to to shift into neutral and
 

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.110 align:start position:0%
so it has to to shift into neutral and
then<00:14:57.120><c> it</c><00:14:57.279><c> stops</c><00:14:58.079><c> then</c><00:14:58.320><c> at</c><00:14:58.399><c> that</c><00:14:58.560><c> point</c><00:14:58.880><c> you</c><00:14:58.959><c> can</c>
