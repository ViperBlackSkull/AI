so<00:08:15.099><c> you</c><00:08:16.419><c> know</c><00:08:17.419><c> I</c><00:08:17.449><c> think</c><00:08:17.629><c> that</c><00:08:17.960><c> that's</c><00:08:18.409><c> pretty</c>

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
so you know I think that that's pretty
 

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.290 align:start position:0%
so you know I think that that's pretty
much<00:08:18.830><c> it</c><00:08:19.039><c> I</c><00:08:19.069><c> mean</c><00:08:19.310><c> there's</c><00:08:19.520><c> a</c><00:08:19.610><c> lot</c><00:08:19.819><c> more</c><00:08:20.089><c> that</c>

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:20.300 align:start position:0%
much it I mean there's a lot more that
 

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.929 align:start position:0%
much it I mean there's a lot more that
we<00:08:20.479><c> can</c><00:08:20.659><c> say</c><00:08:20.830><c> obviously</c><00:08:21.830><c> but</c><00:08:22.099><c> that's</c><00:08:22.550><c> really</c>

00:08:22.929 --> 00:08:22.939 align:start position:0%
we can say obviously but that's really
 

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:24.820 align:start position:0%
we can say obviously but that's really
what<00:08:23.180><c> it</c><00:08:23.240><c> comes</c><00:08:23.479><c> down</c><00:08:23.599><c> to</c><00:08:23.779><c> is</c><00:08:24.199><c> knowing</c><00:08:24.650><c> that</c>

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:24.830 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to is knowing that
 

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.740 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to is knowing that
you<00:08:25.430><c> know</c><00:08:25.550><c> you</c><00:08:25.610><c> have</c><00:08:25.909><c> what</c><00:08:26.150><c> it</c><00:08:26.240><c> takes</c><00:08:26.360><c> to</c><00:08:26.569><c> make</c>

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:26.750 align:start position:0%
you know you have what it takes to make
 

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.540 align:start position:0%
you know you have what it takes to make
it<00:08:26.779><c> you</c><00:08:27.409><c> know</c><00:08:27.529><c> it</c><00:08:27.680><c> might</c><00:08:27.830><c> not</c><00:08:27.860><c> happen</c><00:08:28.219><c> in</c><00:08:28.490><c> the</c>

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
it you know it might not happen in the
 

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.550 align:start position:0%
