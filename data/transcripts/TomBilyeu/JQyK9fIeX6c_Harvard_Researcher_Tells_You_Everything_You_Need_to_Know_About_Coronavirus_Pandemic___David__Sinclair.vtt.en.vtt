i'll call a topical cell you probably
 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
i'll call a topical cell you probably

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
have a much better name for it but
 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
have a much better name for it but
something<00:05:54.560><c> right</c><00:05:54.800><c> on</c><00:05:54.880><c> the</c><00:05:55.039><c> surface</c><00:05:55.840><c> it's</c>

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
something right on the surface it's
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.790 align:start position:0%
something right on the surface it's
getting<00:05:56.560><c> into</c><00:05:56.800><c> that</c><00:05:57.039><c> cell</c><00:05:57.520><c> it's</c><00:05:57.840><c> dividing</c><00:05:58.720><c> and</c>

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
getting into that cell it's dividing and
 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.670 align:start position:0%
getting into that cell it's dividing and
then

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
then
 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.150 align:start position:0%
then
does<00:06:00.000><c> is</c><00:06:00.160><c> the</c><00:06:00.479><c> virus</c><00:06:00.880><c> somehow</c><00:06:01.280><c> still</c><00:06:01.759><c> also</c><00:06:02.080><c> in</c>

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
does is the virus somehow still also in
 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.469 align:start position:0%
does is the virus somehow still also in

yeah<00:06:07.360><c> right</c><00:06:07.600><c> so</c><00:06:07.759><c> these</c><00:06:07.919><c> are</c><00:06:08.160><c> epithelial</c><00:06:08.880><c> cells</c>

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah right so these are epithelial cells
 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.150 align:start position:0%
yeah right so these are epithelial cells
in<00:06:09.840><c> our</c><00:06:10.160><c> lungs</c><00:06:10.960><c> um</c>

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
in our lungs um
and<00:06:12.240><c> we</c><00:06:12.400><c> also</c><00:06:12.639><c> have</c><00:06:12.800><c> endothelial</c><00:06:13.600><c> cells</c><00:06:13.840><c> which</c>

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we also have endothelial cells which
 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.909 align:start position:0%
and we also have endothelial cells which

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
these types of these both these type of
 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
these types of these both these type of

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
cells have a lot of the uh the lock that

spiked protein key inserts into so
 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.710 align:start position:0%

they're the most susceptible
 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.790 align:start position:0%
they're the most susceptible
but<00:06:25.280><c> can</c><00:06:25.520><c> it</c><00:06:25.600><c> get</c><00:06:25.759><c> into</c><00:06:25.919><c> the</c><00:06:26.000><c> blood</c><00:06:26.319><c> absolutely</c>

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
but can it get into the blood absolutely
 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.230 align:start position:0%
but can it get into the blood absolutely
can<00:06:26.960><c> get</c><00:06:27.120><c> into</c><00:06:27.280><c> the</c><00:06:27.360><c> blood</c>

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
can get into the blood
 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.230 align:start position:0%
can get into the blood
but<00:06:28.400><c> it's</c><00:06:28.639><c> easier</c><00:06:29.039><c> to</c><00:06:29.199><c> just</c><00:06:29.440><c> wash</c><00:06:29.759><c> down</c><00:06:30.000><c> into</c>

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
but it's easier to just wash down into
 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.670 align:start position:0%
but it's easier to just wash down into

and that's that's pretty scary because

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
it can cause
 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.469 align:start position:0%
it can cause
uh<00:06:50.000><c> well</c><00:06:50.400><c> potentially</c><00:06:50.960><c> lethal</c><00:06:51.360><c> problems</c>

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh well potentially lethal problems
 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh well potentially lethal problems
so<00:06:52.960><c> going</c><00:06:53.280><c> back</c><00:06:53.440><c> to</c><00:06:53.759><c> what</c><00:06:54.080><c> the</c><00:06:54.479><c> virus</c><00:06:55.039><c> actually</c>

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
so going back to what the virus actually
 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.469 align:start position:0%
so going back to what the virus actually
is

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
is
 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.110 align:start position:0%

you<00:10:03.040><c> can</c><00:10:03.279><c> spread</c><00:10:03.600><c> that</c>

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
you can spread that
 

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.910 align:start position:0%
you can spread that
yeah

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah<00:10:06.240><c> so</c><00:10:06.800><c> all</c><00:10:06.959><c> right</c><00:10:07.040><c> let's</c><00:10:07.200><c> stay</c><00:10:07.360><c> on</c><00:10:07.440><c> this</c>

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so all right let's stay on this
 

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
yeah so all right let's stay on this

is the only way to get rid of this that

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to convert the test all it
was<00:22:26.000><c> was</c><00:22:26.159><c> a</c><00:22:26.240><c> tweet</c><00:22:26.480><c> to</c><00:22:26.640><c> the</c><00:22:26.720><c> software</c><00:22:27.120><c> and</c><00:22:27.200><c> they</c>

were ready
 

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.310 align:start position:0%

if<00:33:59.200><c> you</c><00:33:59.360><c> smoke</c><00:33:59.919><c> stop</c><00:34:00.240><c> immediately</c><00:34:01.360><c> that's</c>

if you smoke stop immediately that's
 

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
if you smoke stop immediately that's
