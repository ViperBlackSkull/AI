00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.060
Tom: Hey everybody, welcome to another episode
of Impact Theory.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.210
You are here my friends, because you believe
that human potential is nearly limitless,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.770
but you know that having potential is not
the same as actually doing something with

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.760
it, so our goal with this show and company
is to introduce you to the people and ideas

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.099
that are gonna help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.339
All right, today's guest is an award winning
photographer, entrepreneur, educator, app

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.160
developer, kino speaker, which he's done by
the way on five continents, director and author.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.340
His multifaceted talents and creations have
not only garnered him a social following measured

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.239
in the millions, but have led him to create
some of the most groundbreaking campaigns

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.070
for some of the biggest companies on the planet,
including Apple, Nike and many many others.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.750
His unique style and insane amount of hustle
have made him one of the top thirty most influential

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.620
photographers of the past decade, according
to photo district news, and his ability to

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.580
bring really fresh eyes and creative solutions
to old problems, has won him countless awards

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.340
and helped him fundamentally alter the landscape
of photography and creative education.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.260
He has helped pioneer many of the things that
we take for granted today by the way, including

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.760
photo sharing apps, he created one a year
and a half before Instagram.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.970
Behind the scenes documenting and virtual
step by step mentorship.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.420
He was a championship for transparency long
before it was trendy to do so, and realizing

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.330
that really a core part of his calling was
to help other people, he founded Creative

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.990
Live, a revolutionary online education resource
with over 1,000 teachers including people

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.560
like Sir Richard Branson, Mark Cuban and Tim
Ferriss.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.240
They've roughly 1,500 classes and over 10,000,000
students who have consumed over 2,000,000,000,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.780
that's with a B, billion, empowering minutes
of content.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.050
So please, dearest friends, help me in welcoming
the man who quit pursuing a career in professional

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.060
soccer, dropped out of medical school and
abandoned getting his PhD in philosophy, so

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.979
he could help change the world.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.920
The incomparable Chase Jarvis.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.079
Chase: Incomparable, I'm gonna remember that
one.

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.250
Tom: Thank you so much for coming.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.530
Chase: I recorded all that shit, I'm gonna
play that anytime I feel bad about myself.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.530
Tom: As you should.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.760
You should give it to Kate, like on a loop
and just let her know.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.400
Chase: She would eye roll right now.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.079
She's gonna watch this and she's like, oh
my god, if I don't get enough of that.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.769
No, thank you so much for having me on the
show.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.060
Great spot, big front door, I love it.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.060
Tom: Yes.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.079
Chase: It's great, it's great to be in your
home.

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.629
Tom: Thank you man, it's great to have you.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.540
Super excited about this one as we were talking
about, before the cameras started rolling.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.519
For me the big thing is, I know I'm gonna
have to do a lot of research on somebody,

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.379
and so it needs to be somebody that the more
I go into it, the more I'm empowering myself.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.980
The more I'm learning about something that
I want to be able to put to use.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.640
And dude, just a treasure [inaudible 00:02:53].

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.769
What was crazy is, before this, I knew you
really well as an influencer, so I'd seen

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.379
a lot of your interviews.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.140
You, both sides of the camera.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.959
I actually didn't know your creative work
very well.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.959
Chase: Aha.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.520
Tom: So that was fun for me to really go deep
on the things you've actually created, and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.810
just, it's amazing.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.319
It's not a surprise that you've had the kind
of success you've had.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.540
Chase: Thank you, again, just keep layering
it on, [inaudible 00:03:14] it in.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.489
No it's very, I pinch myself everyday, I wake
up.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.639
I woke up this morning, here to say an extra
day to do the show, got a little surf in,

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.400
the fact that we're coming here to hang out
with you and your crew, share the information

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.709
that we've cultivated and learned from our
wins and losses over the last several years.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.709
Then onto San Francisco, to basically do more
of that, to go back to Creative Live this

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.709
evening.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.989
It's, yeah, I pinch myself everyday.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.969
I feel lucky to be alive.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.029
I feel thankful to have been able to tap into
my passions.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:55.900
I mean, imagine if more people would have
both, to be put in a position where you could,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.349
and then to be able to tap into the things
that you love and put those together into

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.269
making a living or a life.

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.430
It'd be a better place, the world would, wouldn't
it be?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.430
Tom: Yeah, for sure.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.959
It's interesting that you say, you feel lucky
to be alive.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.069
One of the things I didn't know, is that you
were caught in or almost caught in an avalanche.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.299
Chase: Caught, for sure.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.590
Tom: Walk me through that.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.919
What near death experience obviously has to
be a pretty mind altering thing.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.610
What was it like, what did you take away from
it?

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.500
Chase: Yeah, it's, I haven't been very public
about that.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.010
I'm trying to figure out how to tell that
story in a way that doesn't disrespect the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.810
fact that I really shouldn't be sitting here.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.970
I'm like a one half of a one percent, that,
short story long, I was caught in an avalanche

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.150
in Alaska.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.140
Working on a campaign for, well just, so I
don't put anybody at risk, just one of the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.810
world's top 50 brands.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.250
Tom: Wow.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.970
Chase: I was very knowledgeable, I had spent
a whole lifetime in the back country, shooting

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.930
the worlds top ski and snowboard athletes,
and just mother nature, she has a way of reminding

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.000
us that she's boss and a 100 small things
stacked up, there is no one big indicator.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.650
Everybody was with our crew, we had decades
and decades of experience in the back country

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.750
with avalanche safety.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.640
I just, my number got pulled.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.240
It's a numbers game ultimately, when you spend,
you know, that was where most of my early

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.070
creative work was, in the action sports world.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.200
Ski, surf, snow, skate world.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.770
When a 100% of your time is in the 2 or 3%
of the time that's most dangerous on unskied

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.800
slopes, in the way, way out back country that
never been touched.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.500
Just after a storm, it starts to become a
numbers game and my number got pulled and

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.400
I had just photographed a woman who had made
a bunch of turns, and we were starting to

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.360
pay attention, there was just, you know, mother
nature gives you a little bit of a sign about

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.770
the changing snow conditions.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.010
Then I was just skiing down to get into position
for the next shot and the whole mountain let

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.790
go, and it was about 1,800 vertical feet,
about 200 or 300 feet across and about 10

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.640
feet deep.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.430
Just to give you a picture, that's enough
to fill up five or 10 football fields with

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.710
10 to 20 to 50 feet of snow.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.710
I, without going into the details, I managed
to escape with my life.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.100
I thought I was living the dream then.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.090
You know, traveling ...
Tom: How many years ago was this?

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.090
Chase: This was a long time ago.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.270
This was maybe 10 years ago.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.770
But I was, what I thought living the dream,
traveling the world, shooting for the top

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.090
brands and after that, it's something that
shakes you to your core.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.520
I got up and went to work the next day, which
was something I had to deal with.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.530
But it definitely made me feel like who I
was really in service of was myself.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.740
I was living a fairytale life, traveling all
the world, it's as good as you think it is

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.130
when you read about it in the papers.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.930
There's plenty of grind that's not talked
about, but it certainly made me look beyond

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.010
what I was currently doing.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.280
It's like, wait a minute, this is not actually
impact.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.290
This is, you know, it's fun, but I'm taking
pictures and I'm not really shaping public

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:29.900
opinion or changing the world and so it helped
me look more carefully at the work that I

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.760
was doing, how I was spending my time.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.580
With whom I was spending my time.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.120
Re-assess, and that certainly was a massive
pivot or catapult onto the next phase of my

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.230
career, which was how do you integrate what
you love with having impact.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.840
Tom: So you're a philosophy student, at least
at one point.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.930
You said part of what drew you to philosophy
was that it gave you critical thinking skills.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.640
Walk me through, or walk us all through, what
does that introspection look like?

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.400
Because you've had, I mean, from the outside
it looks like two major moments where you're

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.070
really reflecting that, and then when you
decide that you're gonna leave everybody else's

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.560
dreams to the side and you're gonna do your
own thing, whatever that's gonna be.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.120
I think it'd be super helpful to understand
what that critical process, or was it total

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.120
gut and you were just looking for instinct.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:29.360
Chase: I think I got into philosophy based
on trying to have an out for the career that

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.550
everybody else wanted for me, which was, oh
you're smart and hardworking, I went college

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:40.490
on a soccer scholarship first of all, and
I think that's, when you do that, your whole

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.110
world is focused on that thing.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.440
There's a small fraction of folks who actually
get to do that.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.519
Then have an opportunity to go on and play
professionally.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:52.720
I had that path available to me.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:09:01.379
I started second guessing that path, and philosophy
was this thing that I was interested in, mostly

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:02.400
out of curiosity.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.850
I had some experience with visualization and
meditation early on, specifically around sports

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.850
and sport psychology.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.790
How to be an elite performer as an athlete.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.199
Tom: I was introduced to you by the teams
that you were working with?

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:15.199
Chase: Yeah.

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:20.760
I was on the Olympic development team, which
is just basically the team that they're getting

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.170
ready to go for the Olympics every four years,
but they keep it going in-between the Olympic

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.160
cycles.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.570
When you have to go to school and you have
to pick a major.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:36.120
I didn't know what I wanted to do, I was pretty
focused on soccer, and so what's the fallback.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.399
I remember just asking friends and peers and
the answers were like, oh if you're smart

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:44.980
and hardworking you should be a doctor or
a lawyer.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.090
I was like, okay.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.300
I just literally started taking classes in
pre med, and started volunteering at hospitals

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:58.060
and just setting up that path, realizing only
way in, it's like, wait a minute, I'm very

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.259
different than anyone else who's on this sort
of path.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:03.339
Didn't feel good, so philosophy.

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:04.850
Tom: Because they had like a drive for that?

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.209
Chase: Yeah, a drive, a passion.

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:10.220
Not that I didn't like caring for people,
I mean I worked in children's hospital with

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.160
super sick kids as my rotation and getting
experience.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.350
It was just so depressing, so, I mean, the
people that do that work, it's unbelievable.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:25.579
They're level of character and passion and
focus that you have to have to stay on that

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:29.910
in a world where you're, all of that stuff
is so good at tearing you apart.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.910
Tom: I could imagine, literally.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.720
Chase: But philosophy, to get back to your
original question.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.509
It was an escape from that world.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:39.230
I was like, wait a minute, you mean I can
get college credits for reading Nietzsche

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.439
and Heidegger and thinking about creativity.

00:10:43.439 --> 00:10:49.770
It was actually the philosophy of art, that
got me most interested in art.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:59.370
I had always been creative as a kid, but fundamentally
stuffed that down, because where I grew up,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.269
suburbs outside of Seattle.

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:05.009
Being creative, you know, oh he's the creative
kid, that wasn't a good thing.

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:07.879
That was like, wait a minute, you're saying
I'm creative?

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.639
That means I'm weird?

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:15.649
I didn't want to be weird, I wanted to fit
in like most young kids.

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:17.819
I was like, what fits in?

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:21.240
Oh, the captain of a football team, great,
I'll do that.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.740
It was really, I was chasing that dream which
was someone else's dream, I happened to be

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:33.079
a decent athlete and that ended up guiding
me to college, but I had always repressed

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:34.500
the creative side.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.459
When I started taking philosophy classes,
specifically the philosophy of photography,

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:41.949
the philosophy of aesthetics and this was
just part of the normal course of study.

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:45.230
I was like, oh yeah, it's a part of me.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.940
Started leaning more and more into that.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.350
Tom: Is it just like a sense of being more
alive when you're doing it, that you say it's

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.350
a part of you?

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.350
Chase: Yeah.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.370
I think It's the part that you said at the
end of the question around, is it really just

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.370
intuition.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.699
What I was doing was justifying my intuition.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:04.860
Hey, I'm still gonna get a PhD mom.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.889
I bailed on medical school, after doing all
the MCATs and all that stuff, the interviews.

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:11.660
Gonna go to the University of Washington Medical
School.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.499
Freaked out, bailed on that.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:16.399
It's like, okay, I'm still gonna be, it's
gonna be okay.

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:19.480
I'm gonna be a doctor, but just a PhD, how
is that?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.380
Does that meet up with everybody's expectations
of what a hardworking son should be?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:32.680
Ultimately, the philosophy part of that extension
or the bullshit that I was feeding myself

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.170
was critical thinking.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:40.200
I was like wow, these people, I might not
feel like the graduate student who's over

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.180
there, with the beret and the cigarette, smoking
and talking about Nietzsche, but I was learning

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:53.490
and I was reading and being informed by everybody
from Playdough to Seneca to Nietzsche to just

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.439
these big old philosopher names.

00:12:56.439 --> 00:13:02.970
I realized only now, that that was a foundation
for A, critical thinking but also it opened

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.600
me up to, when you apply critical thinking
to yourself.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.579
Like, wait a minute, what am I doing?

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.620
I'm actually living everybody else's dream,
for me.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.129
Rather than writing my own script.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:23.970
That element of self reflection that I gained
from studying philosophy, helped me shake

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.970
up the whole scene.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.189
Like, wait a minute, this is not who I am,
this is not what I'm supposed to be.

00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:33.119
And, you know, you go back to your childhood.

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:37.449
What are the things that you're excited about
as a young kid and that was making things.

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:42.020
I was an only child, I didn't have a lot of
toys, it was like, block of wood, go entertain

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.020
yourself.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.649
I had wild imagination, that I had sort of
been repressing for my whole life.

00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:52.249
As soon you talked about intuition, ultimately,
I think this is intuition at work.

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:54.360
Fighting against a lot of cultural forces.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.149
I talk a lot about this today.

00:13:56.149 --> 00:14:03.740
I bet if I surveyed everyone here in the room,
that a good bit of them had been shown a path,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.610
shown the door, this is actually, this is
what you should do.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.970
I'm trying to get with Creative Live and with
being on your show here.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.680
Trying to get people to think, like wait a
minute, am I doing the thing that I want to

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.480
do or is it cultural pressure, pressure from
my parents, pressure from the [inaudible 00:14:18],

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.069
the family to do some other thing.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.069
Tom: Right.

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:26.470
Chase: I just lo and behold, there's a lot
of people for whom that has been a bigger

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.249
shaper of what they're on their path to do,
as opposed to the thing that they actually

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:35.050
want to do, which is governed by intuition.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:40.860
In a long roundabout way, through a bunch
of experience, I learned the hard way, but

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.149
ultimately found my path.

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:45.970
Tom: One of the things you said, this is gonna
be close to a direct quote.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.959
The most important thing that you could cultivate
is the ability to listen to your intuition.

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:51.959
Chase: Yes.

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.209
Tom: How do you cultivate that?

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:57.949
Chase: Self awareness is huge.

00:14:57.949 --> 00:15:01.949
That monologue that I just went on about.

00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:05.769
All of the steps that I took to be able to
self reflect.

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:08.499
Tom: Does it start from a feeling?

00:15:08.499 --> 00:15:13.090
Chase: It certainly, there's always a feeling,
and that's the thing that we are told, we

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.040
are taught to ignore feelings.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.689
We've done a terrible job culturally, not
just in the US, but in the west, we have done

00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:30.449
a very bad job of cultivating ones desire,
expectation, ability to listen to our intuition.

00:15:30.449 --> 00:15:32.060
It was, you know, we all have different paths.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:39.309
Some through grief, some through achievement,
some through struggle, to start to listen,

00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:40.399
we all have that compass.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.449
Tom: What is it about grief?

00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:46.040
That one really stuck out to me, so ... Is
it a big event that just sort of slaps you

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.629
out of your normal way of thinking?

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:49.699
Chase: Yeah.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:53.199
This really, this shit gets me up in the morning,
so I've talked to thousands of people.

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:56.670
I ended up being, you know, when you do find
your path and you're lucky enough to grab

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.970
onto that string that gives you a hell of
a ride, which is what I feel like I've been

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.970
on.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.839
Ended up being a career counselor.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.949
I love it, I ended up talking to people.

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:11.769
I mentioned grief just off the cuff, because
I have had so many people toe to toe, after

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:16.399
I get off stage at an event or something,
saying I knew who you were, but your message

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:20.489
really resonated with me, when my mom died.

00:16:20.489 --> 00:16:27.649
When I lost my husband, when I broke up with
my girlfriend, I lost my house.

00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:33.149
This process of grieving and realizing that
either recognition of our own mortality or

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:34.149
just some event.

00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:36.160
You're like, wait a minute.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.489
This is not, all this stuff that I'm being
programmed and told, that's not what this

00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:40.489
is about.

00:16:40.489 --> 00:16:43.269
Tom: Are you familiar with Jamie, I know you
know Steven Kotler.

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:46.420
Are you familiar with Jamie Wheal, Steven
Kotler and their new book?

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.470
Stealing Fire?

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.519
Chase: Yeah.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:53.040
I was exchanging emails with Steven in the
car on the way up here.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040
Tom: Really?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040
That's crazy.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040
Chase: Yup.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040
Tom: Have you read it yet?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040
Chase: I haven't.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040
Tom: Oh dude you're gonna love it.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.769
The reason I'm going so deep in this question
is like, so many people come to me and they

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:04.280
have a sense that they could do more, they
could be more, but they don't quite know what

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.280
that is.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.250
They don't even know how to put words around
this feeling that they have in their mind.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.519
Chase: They don't know how to start, what's
the first step?

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:12.519
Tom: Exactly.

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:17.120
One of the parts of Stealing Fire is, you
have to learn to tap into non ordinary states

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120
of consciousness.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.429
Which is why when you said grief, I thought
wow, because they don't touch on stuff like

00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:25.209
that, but I think that that is literally what's
happening.

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:27.069
It's that ...
Chase: You need someone to slap you out of

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.880
the day today, because it's so easy to blame
anything.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.170
We can blame the political environment, we
can blame our health, we can blame so many

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.549
things on, oh it's just easy to stay on this
path, and whatever the thing is, that's why

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:41.549
I mentioned grief.

00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:48.250
Whatever the thing is that gets you out of
that state of numbness.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.840
For me, was an avalanche.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.200
For me it was a 10 year recognition.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.060
Just to be clear, just for a second, small
departure.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.279
I grew up middle, lower middle class.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:06.000
White, suburban, and it was hard for me to
resist all of the things that culture was

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.180
telling me I had to be.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.179
Imagine people who have less opportunity.

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:15.370
Who are people of color, who are females.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.740
I'm a huge, I'm on this mission down here
in LA, I've been focusing on interviewing

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.580
some of the strongest females I know, trying
to get the feminine as the new energy that

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.549
I think our culture needs.

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:32.100
But imagine if you had all those other disadvantages,
how much harder it would be than it was for

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.100
me.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.240
And it took me, well, half a lifetime.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.960
To me that's catastrophic, failure of our
culture, that's sad.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.100
Tom: Dude, you sent me chills.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:45.210
Chase: The flip side of that then, is if we
can increase our self awareness.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.540
If we can program people through non traditional
channels and ultimately I would like to see

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.540
the school system change.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.030
I don't have a lot of optimism for that, just
based on the [inaudible 00:18:54], which is

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.870
one of the reasons we created Creative Live.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:05.330
But if we can create a longstanding, something
that has durability, a vein in culture, which

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.920
helps people understand that you have to write
your own script.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.149
If you don't, someone else will surely write
it for you.

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:18.140
If we can change that mindset, that's one
of the things that I'm chasing.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.000
We get little glimpses of it day to day, we
get a big dose of it at Creative Live.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.640
That's the thing that I'm focused on, so the
fact that we all, collective consciousness,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:37.460
you, Steven, Gary, Tim, Ariana, Brene Brown.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:44.970
There's a real, what I feel like, is finally
sort of a movement towards some of these new

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.970
ideals.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.970
To me that's exciting.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.380
Tom: So you gave me the chills a few minutes
ago, talking about culture, talking about

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.940
the need for feminine energy, which is something
that we're working on.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.929
But the whole thing at Impact Theory is that.

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:01.740
If growing up in a middle class environment,
white, with privilege and all of that.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:08.410
You still have a hard time, how do we adjust
culture enough to make sure that anybody,

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.340
no matter where you grew up.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.451
Impoverished, undereducated, whatever the
thing is that you got going against you, how

00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:19.010
do we really impact that culture?

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.830
It does to me also feel like a movement, there's
a lot of people creating a lot of energy.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.690
Creating social content, certainly.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.230
But where it gets really interesting to me
is, like what you're doing with Creative Live,

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.530
where it's foundational and I don't think
that we have to change the education system

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.169
from within.

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:36.320
You doing what you're doing with creative
live becomes like a whole another thing.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.951
We're trying to create not only social content,
but traditional narrative content, because

00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:43.200
don't try to change behavior, that's my thing.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.200
Leverage behavior.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200
Chase: Exactly.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.370
Tom: I already know people are gonna be watching
movies, reading books, watching Netflix, all

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.370
that stuff.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:55.110
Now, I want to incept them with ideology,
by understanding how mythology works, how

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.789
can humans consume that and pass on that ideology.

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:58.799
Chase: Yeah.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.840
Storytelling, it's been like a campfire.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.840
Cavemen time.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.679
Tom: You've said that the world thinks in
narrative.

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:05.679
Chase: I do.

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:06.679
Tom: What do you mean by that?

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:08.940
Chase: That's how we remember stories.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.250
That's how ideas are passed along that are
sticky.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.350
Just, I think it's, as we're hardwired for
language, if you, you know, read any Noam

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.710
Chomsky, we're also hardwired for narrative.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.750
Narrative is a product of language.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:31.669
If, yeah and you see that in pop culture,
great story tellers, it's like the pied piper.

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:35.179
I forget who wrote the book, Tell to Win,
was it Peter Guber?

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:45.320
Great book around creating narratives to attach
ideas, ideologies and inspiration to.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.480
I think ultimately that's one of the reasons
that I, certainly not the original reason

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.510
I went into it, but now looking backwards,
that I was focused on telling stories as a

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:00.500
creator, as a photographer and a director,
was, you know, that's the use case that I

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:07.120
can now carry into this part of my life, telling
people stories not just about avalanches,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.970
but about other people tapping into their
most internal authentic selves in order to

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.809
direct their living life, career, whatever,
path.

00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:22.190
That's what makes that sticky, is narrative.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.250
Tom: It's interesting.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:31.000
Going back to narrative and narrative's ability
to juxtapose ideas, that may otherwise seem

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.610
totally unrelated.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.649
I find it interesting that you created a lot
of your success being a type, a hard driver,

00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:42.860
like busting ass, but that you've also found
meditation and which, and also use my own

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.000
experience, I see meditation as being very
soft, like a nice contrast.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Chase: Yeah.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.120
Tom: I meditate right after I work out, because
I like that juxtaposition of the intensity

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.760
and then how rapidly can I sort of [inaudible
00:22:53] everything.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.750
How has that friction helped you between being
a type, a hard driver, because I know at one

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.899
point you were concerned that meditation was
actually gonna soften you in some way.

00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:04.899
Chase: Right.

00:23:04.899 --> 00:23:08.210
We have, I think, Tim Ferriss and I, who,
Tim is a lovely, him and I have been friends

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.850
for a long time.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:18.420
First of all, A, it was I remember a couple
of conversations about, isn't this edge, this

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.210
like, at your core, you got a fire in your
belly, you're driven, you mentioned sort of

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.269
type a, hard charging, whatever words that
you had associated with that.

00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:34.639
You start to believe your own story, that
that is what has created your success.

00:23:34.639 --> 00:23:36.230
We don't stop or pause.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.639
We're unwilling to part with that, even long
enough to see if that narrative, that self

00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:43.070
narrative is true.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:49.080
Because if we stop that hard charging, type
a, aggro, you know, undercurrent.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.080
Will we lose a step?

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.090
Will we lose two steps?

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.480
Will we fall from the position that we've
worked so hard to get ourselves into?

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.110
I remember, specifically, exactly what I've
said when talking to Tim, and he was feeding

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.110
me this line.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:05.610
I was like, all those things you said, I thought
the exact ... I can only say what my truth

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.279
is, I can't say what your truth is Tim, but
just give it a shot.

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:13.190
How about, what if you were able to think
about that thing that you thought was propelling

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.610
you, is actually an anchor?

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:23.860
That is the thing that is keeping you down
or small or at some percentage of your potential

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.320
rather than that way around.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.490
Try and tell yourself that narrative, just
long enough for you to take a break from your

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:35.440
aggro, hard charging, type a life, and you
know, there's any, one of these types of meditation

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:44.380
I happened to steer Tim, and I found transcendental
meditation, TM, tm.org as one that was sticky

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.590
for me.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:52.029
Tim ended up gravitating to that same thing
and when you're able to make that switch,

00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:54.621
you realize as I did, I think as Tim did,
that ...

00:24:54.621 --> 00:24:56.240
Tom: When you say switch you mean switch in
the narrative?

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240
Chase: Yeah.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.700
Switch the narrative and change your daily
habits, such that meditation is a part of

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.770
your day today.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.019
For me, I was quickly easy to see that.

00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:09.320
Oh my god, this is actually, it's like a rocket.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.750
It's like a booster, because now everything
around me is happening in slow motion.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.019
I don't get fired up.

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:19.059
It was a fundamental change in the way that
I interacted with the world.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:23.650
I don't want to preach meditation because
it's not for everybody.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.880
There is just, if you read Tools of Titans,
Tim's book?

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.549
Tom: I have, oh, of course.

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:31.200
Chase: The number one correlated thing across
all those people is some sort of mindfulness

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200
practice.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200
Tom: Now, you ready?

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200
Chase: Yeah.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200
Tom: I'm gonna be the asshole that says it's
for everybody.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200
Chase: There you go.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.760
Tom: Because I'm just taking it from a neurological
perspectively.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.200
Purely from a neurological perspective, because
I know what's happening.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.200
You're tapping into the parasympathetic nervous
system, your calming down the sympathetic.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.570
It's biochemistry, right?

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.930
Chase: Yeah.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.980
If you believe in biochemistry, then give
it a shot.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.980
I'm a huge advocate.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:57.019
I try not to sell it too hard, because anytime
someone's trying to say something it feels

00:25:57.019 --> 00:26:00.590
inauthentic, but it's just giving me a lot
of joy.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.590
Tom: Yeah.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:06.120
No, I think that it's like you, you embraced
it pretty quickly.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.450
Like Tim, I did not.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:13.330
I really felt that it was super soft and I
never thought of it as taking a step off my

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.330
edge.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.240
It just felt like, probably because my self
narrative.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.090
Growing up, I was not good at sports.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:25.250
I did not feel overly tough, and so toughening
up was lesson number one for me as an entrepreneur.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.250
Chase: Got it.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.160
Tom: To not be the guy reacting like, hey
this guys is falling, I just really had to

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.210
steal myself and work on mental toughness,
and so that was like, I put so much energy

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.250
into that for such a long time, that by the
time people were telling me, hey, you should

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.250
meditate.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.250
I was like, what?

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.250
Chase: Yeah.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.509
Then how long into it, before you felt a change
in your own?

00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:44.779
Tom: The first day.

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:45.779
Chase: Yeah.

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:49.190
Tom: It was so immediate and so massive, because
I was coming to it from the place of a navy

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:54.490
seal, told me stop being a dumb ass, understand
what meditation is doing to your brain and

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.309
just try it.

00:26:56.309 --> 00:27:00.990
Then I was like, okay, I understand what's
going on from, I'm trying to, you know, you

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.240
have gas and brake.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.380
The gas is your sympathetic nervous system,
and your brake is rest and digest.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.179
It's the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:12.850
Once he could explain it to me like that,
then it was like, okay, it's not woo woo anymore,

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:19.200
it doesn't make me feel like I'm reverting
back to my less than tough days.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200
Chase: Yeah.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.519
Tom: When I sat down to do it and I could
imagine what I was trying to do to my brain,

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:27.450
and the breathing and understanding diaphragm
breathing and all of that.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.680
If you are used to breathing shallow, you
just do one breath from your diaphragm, you'll

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.780
feel it right away.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.309
Chase: Yeah, it's like a self buzz a little
bit.

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:35.309
Tom: Yeah.

00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:41.120
As somebody who naturally runs at a high stress
level, which I'll call background radiation.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.539
If I don't meditate, my background radiation
levels just creep up, creep up, creep up.

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:47.549
Chase: I like that, that's a good name for
it.

00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:53.700
Tom: It was really really, it was a life saver.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:59.250
In the sense that I think if I had continued
to not meditate, I would have ended up overwhelmed

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.440
or depressed.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.450
I didn't but once I started doing it and could
reflect back, I was like whoa.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.179
It felt like dodging a bullet.

00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:08.980
Talk to me about visualization.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.790
How specifically do you do it, how concrete
are the images in your mind, what's the end

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.790
goal?

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.790
Chase: I read headlines.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.830
Actual words in an article.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:18.990
I write an article ...
Tom: In your mind?

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:24.330
Chase: I write an article or a press release,
or like I'm literally reading the outcome

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.919
as if it has already happened and being reported
to ...

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:31.649
Tom: Chase Jarvis wins an award for revolutionary
new photo technique.

00:28:31.649 --> 00:28:33.490
Chase: Sure, yeah.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.009
I try and be less me centric.

00:28:36.009 --> 00:28:37.009
Tom: Really?

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:42.740
Chase: My goals are a little bit, involve
movements or groups of people or Creative

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.040
Live.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.140
But I have personal goals, for sure.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.929
But anything that's more public facing, I
have a press release written in my head and

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:54.289
I read it in my mind's eye everyday, every
morning.

00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:55.289
Tom: The same one?

00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:56.880
Or you're constantly creating new ones?

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.529
Chase: I have a base narrative that I go to,
and so it's not literally the same exact words,

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:05.443
but it's same in principle and I do it everyday.

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:06.460
Tom: Damn, I had never heard that before.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.480
It's super powerful.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:14.830
Chase: With sports, it was very much about
trying to involve, there's a component of

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.090
relaxation prior to it, so I do it just after
meditating.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:23.080
You're more receptive, I've learned through
research and my own personal experience.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:31.940
That you're more, your body, your mind are
more receptive to the suggestions and I, in

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.539
the sports worlds, I would like, you could
smell the grass, see the ball going in the

00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:36.539
net.

00:29:36.539 --> 00:29:37.890
Tom: Would you say I smell the grass?

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.659
Or would you actually ...
Chase: I have in some cases.

00:29:41.659 --> 00:29:43.179
I talked to myself.

00:29:43.179 --> 00:29:47.629
I will like literally say the words out loud
to give it an extra dimension.

00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:48.629
The audio dimension.

00:29:48.629 --> 00:29:49.629
Tom: Wow.

00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:53.810
Chase: But incorporating sights and smells,
what did it smell like.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.340
The paper of a contract being signed.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.519
Or what did the ink smell like, what did the
grass smell like on game day?

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:04.759
What was the experiences in your body was
you saw the ball hit the net.

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:11.710
Again, whatever, I'm telling myself a complex
narrative, that I have 100% made up about

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.770
the moment after you realized the dream has
come through.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.450
Tom: I've never heard anybody use words before,
and that's so liberating for me, because I'm

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:26.389
actually really bad at seeing something in
concrete detail.

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:29.110
Especially coming from you, I would figure,
as a photographer, you can just sort of close

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.870
your eyes and imagine ...
Chase: Yeah.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.440
Sure, and I'm painfully visual.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.200
That's part of the reason that I have sought
these other senses.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.759
Auditory, words, even smell.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:45.240
Again, I mentioned a couple times already,
like smelling the grass.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.889
What it felt like to be in the moment on the
soccer fields when you scored the winning

00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:50.530
goal or whatever the thing is.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.289
I just tried to incorporate more senses.

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:53.630
Tom: Wow, that's really incredible.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.630
Chase: Yeah.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:55.630
Tom: Using words.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.919
That, I'm gonna try that.

00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:58.299
Chase: Language is powerful.

00:30:58.299 --> 00:30:59.580
Tom: Yeah.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.510
Chase: Words matter and choose them, you know,
obviously they can, especially in our culture

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:09.029
now, there's a sort of, in a post truth world
...

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:10.960
Tom: That's terrifying.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.260
Chase: Yeah.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:18.029
There's this goal to erode the word, but the
thing that my reason for knowing that words

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:20.730
are powerful is the effect that they have
on our bodies.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.249
I think Tony Robbins talks about, I might
get this wrong, but you have to have the right

00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:30.039
state, before you can tell yourself the right
story, before you can get the right strategy

00:31:30.039 --> 00:31:31.889
in place.

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:34.740
Anytime you try and go right to one of the
other things, like if you try and go right

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.110
to the right strategy, but you're in a shitty
head space.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.700
You're not gonna get the strategy right.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.090
He calls his daily routine priming.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:50.330
Whatever the activities that we all do every
day or morning or in this case visualization.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.100
If I realize that those things are true for
me too.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.789
If I first and foremost and control my state,
my emotional state.

00:31:56.789 --> 00:32:01.049
I can be in a positive head space, and know
that the world's out there, looking out for

00:32:01.049 --> 00:32:04.970
me and that I am in part, in control of my
destiny.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:10.010
That helps me create a great narrative, whether
this is a narrative of self empowerment or

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.870
supporting others or just creating the world
that I'm hoping to create.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.460
The strategy is like, oh I have to wake up
and I have to go do this thing, or help this

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:25.799
person or be receptive to these ideas, such
that I can tap into my dreams.

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:29.370
Again, I look at that whole world as really
valuable.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:36.100
I think it's massively underappreciated and
again, I'm sort of, I feel like an everyday

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.470
guy.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.999
Everyday Joe.

00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:40.779
I have put these techniques to work for me.

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:45.542
I don't preach them, but I can't think of
what my life would be like, you know, you

00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:48.960
talked about how would your stress level be,
what your health would be without some of

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.130
the practices that you've made use of.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.379
I'm in the same boat.

00:32:54.379 --> 00:33:00.769
I can't even imagine, I wouldn't be on the
show, if it wasn't for some of these techniques

00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:01.769
and tools.

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:02.769
Tom: Yeah.

00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:03.769
I love that.

00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:05.649
You said that habits are like really important
in your life.

00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:07.929
I feel exactly the same.

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:12.169
When one of the goals of doing this show,
and I've got to imagine it's similar for you,

00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:17.870
is to one, I don't want people to think that
what I've achieved as a result of being extraordinary.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.429
Nobody thought anything of me as a kid.

00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:24.750
Not voted most likely to succeed, grew up
in Tacoma, Washington, undereducated in my

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.200
opinion.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.419
But just started, brick by brick, like today,
I will start visualizing using words, which

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:33.419
I have never done before.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:34.419
Chase: Great.

00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:35.419
Let me know how it goes.

00:33:35.419 --> 00:33:36.419
Tom: That's incredibly powerful.

00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:37.419
For sure.

00:33:37.419 --> 00:33:38.419
Chase: Yeah.

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:39.419
It's powerful.

00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:41.409
Tom: Taking those bricks, you get enough of
them and then you're able to execute at a

00:33:41.409 --> 00:33:44.999
higher level, that's like the point that we're
wanting to do in the show.

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:45.999
Chase: Sweet.

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:50.360
I want to talk, I also have a show, called
Chase Jarvis Live on Creative Live, so it's

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.140
somewhat a selfish behavior.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.080
Because you want to sit down with the world's
top experts.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.779
You know, that's actually why Creative Live
exists.

00:33:56.779 --> 00:33:58.440
Because I wanted to learn from these people.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.700
Sure, I certainly wanted to give them a platform
and connect the audience that I had built

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.740
over years and years of hard work.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.220
Accidentally, built an audience and wanted
to connect that with my friends who are the

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.220
best in the world.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.570
But my personal interview show, and in part
Creative Live is very much about, how can

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:20.809
I be next to people who inspire the hell out
of me?

00:34:20.809 --> 00:34:26.470
If you can add enough value to them, I'm clearly
gonna get value from being on your show, and

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:31.179
I'm hoping that, you know, tell me, is that
one of the reasons that you started the show?

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.409
Tom: A 100%.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.819
It's close to the only reason.

00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:34.819
Chase: Yeah.

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:36.760
Tom: Just wanting to learn, you know.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:42.679
Wanting to encounter people and so, at the
time that we started, it was originally a

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.090
show called inside quest.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.970
We have 1,400 employees.

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:48.649
And we had, in fact, this is something I want
to talk to you about.

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:53.660
We had this list of our core values and I
didn't want them to memorize it and not live

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.660
them.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.210
I wanted to bring people in, just because
I was utterly convinced, that some, there

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.880
were 25 bullet points.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.940
That every guest that came on, would relate
to and just naturally [inaudible 00:35:04]

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.540
one, two, three, four, five of the different
bullet points and people would see.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.560
Like, hey, these are, because it wasn't like
this is what you need to do to successful

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.560
at quest.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.119
This we needed to do to be successful at anything.

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:19.400
Hearing these high level people come in and
talk about it naturally and then be able to

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.030
go, okay, yeah, that really is exactly what
is on this list.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.560
That was real big driver for me as well.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.560
Chase: So true.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.900
We talk about the same thing at Creative Live.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.930
We have core values.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.350
It's the thing we spend the most time talking
about in our all hands meetings.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.980
Tom: Your core values are amazing.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.670
Walk us through a couple of the ones that
you think are just critical.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.140
Chase: Since you asked me to choose a couple,
I'll just choose the first three, because

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.451
I think they're the top ones.

00:35:44.451 --> 00:35:49.580
Which is, creativity, access and community.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:56.123
Creativity, I think it's the thing that differentiates
us from so many of the species on the planet.

00:35:56.123 --> 00:35:59.870
The fact that we can take two disparate ideas
that weren't otherwise together, put those

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.930
things together to make something new, and
ideally useful.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.400
Tom: Do people train themselves to do that?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400
Chase: Absolutely.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.700
It's not a skill, it's a habit.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.380
Tom: Love that.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.980
I just want to get into that habit.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.820
Chase: You get into it by doing it.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.820
That's the thing.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.200
It feels very unnatural at first, and then
try things like morning pages, try things

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.480
like creating something everyday.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.480
Since we all have phones with this, it's very
easy to do these things.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.260
Playing the guitar, taking pictures everyday,
writing in a journal.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:30.100
All those things will make you better brain
surgeons, a better athlete, a better, like

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:34.819
there's, the science is abundantly clear,
that creativity creates creativity.

00:36:34.819 --> 00:36:41.250
I should know the study, there's this great
study that unequivocal creativity creates

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.790
creativity.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.710
It doesn't really, it's not necessarily field
specific.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:46.710
Tom: Yeah.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.640
Chase: Just those few pathways in the brain
of connecting unlikely things to make something

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.940
new and useful.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.480
Having that as a core value is a no brainer.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.420
It is also, you know, that's one of my core
missions as a human, is to make the world

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.569
a more creative place.

00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:04.970
Second one, access.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:10.560
I realized, when I decided, you know, threw
away everybody else's narrative for me, that

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:16.130
I wanted to be a creator, a professional photographer
and a director.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:20.800
When I looked around that, I didn't have access
to experts.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:26.130
This is really pre your early net, the idea
of behind the scenes video, those words didn't

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.010
even, they were never put together.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.030
Behind the scenes video.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.010
It wasn't a part of the lexicon of culture.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.319
I was like, wait a minute, this is terrible,
because there are so many people.

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:41.430
They did call it mentors, but mentors are
behind locked doors and Ivory towers and building

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.550
covered with ivy and I didn't have access
to any of that.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.460
I had to take the swings myself, learn from
experience.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:55.569
Why am I doing this and so many other people
could benefit, so I started sharing that.

00:37:55.569 --> 00:37:59.400
That first inclination of access is in part.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.030
I believe, why I was sitting here today.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.309
Because I'm, I have cultivated a world where
that is normal.

00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:11.450
A world around me that's what Creative Live,
obviously it's a core value there, but I started

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.930
out as a photographer by sharing trade secrets.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:15.930
This is what it's like.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:22.490
This is my behind the scenes, with professional
athlete, x, y or z or this famous snowboarder

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.490
or whatever.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:27.819
This is what it's like to suck, this is what
it's like to get a job and lose a job.

00:38:27.819 --> 00:38:31.200
Providing access to my life, it was totally
incidental.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.980
I was trying to help my industry, because
I figured if I could send a paradigm for sharing

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:41.000
secrets about photography, that I could actually,
someone else would reciprocate and I can learn

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.950
something too.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.490
That's access and community.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.510
Was there a third one?

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.770
Community is also, I think it's fundamentally
one of the reasons that I'm sitting here on

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.790
your couch.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:58.000
Having built community and having, you know,
when I mentioned earlier.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.490
Why did you start the show.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:05.349
You're also, you're building community, you're
serving your own needs by having people that

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:09.190
are inspirational to you, sit here on the
chair, in the chair next to you, but everyone

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:17.300
in the room and beyond, ultimate that distills
to community and if you've given value to

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.650
that community, I'm sure you've also received
a ton of value of the folks, who are liking

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:25.920
and sharing, and helping support your vision
and mission here.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.859
Same is true for Creative Live.

00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:30.930
We have 10,000,000 students, we serve every
country on the planet.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:35.630
This is crazy, global community of creators,
who are all trying to figure it out.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:40.410
Who are all told that, you know, only some
of us are creative, we're all told that in

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:45.020
order to be a greater artist you shouldn't
touch business, and in order to be a business

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.800
person, then you just have to be cutthroat
and you know, I just don't believe in those

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.110
paradigms and if we can learn and leverage
one another's skills and share information,

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.500
then how much better would the world be?

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.280
That's sort of three of the core values, three
out of seven.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.210
These are how we make decisions in the company.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:05.430
Tom: I love it.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:09.770
All right, where can these guys find you online,
before I ask my final question?

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.250
Chase: Oh.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.599
That was fast.

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:15.599
Whoa.

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:24.040
I'm @chasejarvis personally, Creative Live
is @creativelive, all one word, on everything.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.010
To me, that would bring me great joy if, I
wonder if we could do something, do you guys

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.010
have some show notes?

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.299
We'll try and do something for your audience.

00:40:30.299 --> 00:40:31.299
Tom: Absolutely.

00:40:31.299 --> 00:40:33.819
Chase: We'll try and get a special, a discount
code or something, I'll work on that.

00:40:33.819 --> 00:40:34.819
Tom: Amazing.

00:40:34.819 --> 00:40:38.359
Chase: So that we can support your community.

00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:46.611
That'd be my first and foremost ask is to
go there, come find, I'm accessible, using

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:47.611
my core value.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.470
All right, now you gotta be, I'm gonna drink
some water while you ask the question.

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.900
Tom: Yeah dude, yeah, take a sip, take a sip.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.900
Here we go.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.930
The audience already knows what I'm gonna
ask.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:54.930
Chase: [crosstalk 00:40:53] All right.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.330
Tom: But yes.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:00.980
What is my friend, the impact that you want
to have on the world?

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.500
Chase: Impact?

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.309
I would like to help other people live their
dreams.

00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:17.640
Whether that's in career, in hobby or in life.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.970
To me, that is an impact that has a lever
behind it.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:33.940
But I have never seen or felt the world more
alive, the people around me more alive, than

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.780
when they are doing the thing that makes them
feel great.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:44.160
If the impact that I can have is to provide
more opportunities and more options and more

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.820
focus on that, as the goal of life.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.170
Living your truth, authentically, then I would
die a happy man.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:54.170
Tom: That's incredible.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:58.210
Then tell them why playing it safe is the
most dangerous thing they could do.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:03.470
Chase: If you head Cuban, recently came out
and said that it's not programming jobs that

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.940
are the jobs of the future, because all of
those will be automated.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.300
Because when programming can program for itself,
what do you need?

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.819
You need creativity, you need ideation, you
need the ability to differentiate not just

00:42:13.819 --> 00:42:15.850
on math, because it's not all about math.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.020
It's math plus the human element.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.270
Creativity is actually the most valuable thing
in the next generation.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:26.200
It is the first time in the history, that
were where those systems that have been in

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.099
place that were, quote the safe bets.

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:35.722
Go to college, get good grades, you'll get
a good job, then you'll work for a company

00:42:35.722 --> 00:42:38.940
for 40 years, you'll get the gold watch and
you'll have a great retirement.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.770
That's just fundamentally not true.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:42.839
A, the school system's changing.

00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:45.380
It's being, you know, it's leaving behind
so many people.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.380
B, employment.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:52.410
There is gonna be I think 53,000,000 Americans
are gonna have a side hustle by 2020.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.490
Tom: Whoa.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:58.131
Chase: The four year university is not at
all set up to accommodate that.

00:42:58.131 --> 00:43:03.839
Accommodate, that sounds like it's being graceful
to deal with that.

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:08.360
If our parents had one job, we will have five,
the next generation will have five jobs at

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.140
the same time.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.100
If you think along those paradigms.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.650
All of the old systems are completely inadequate.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:22.579
That is why creative live exists, that is
why that you will learn an infinite amount

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:27.190
of skills over the next X number of years
in your life, in a way that's much different

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.590
than the way you learned 10 or 15 years ago.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.549
Learning is the new master paradigm.

00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:37.290
It's the first time in the history of the
world, that the safe thing is now the riskiest

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.140
thing you can do.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.470
If you're not paying attention to this stuff,
you need to wake up.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:47.390
I don't know if you read the headlines lately
but, it shouldn't be a fear thing.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.880
Maybe we change that and just like, what an
amazing time it is, where we have access to

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.240
this knowledge, where it doesn't cost a million
dollars.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.780
Creative Live has a free options and there's
so many other learning sites.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.960
You just got freaking YouTube.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.020
What are you doing, what's the next thing
for you, that is gonna keep you on that path

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.040
that I referenced earlier?

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.079
Tom: I love that.

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:08.210
Man, thank you so much for coming to the show.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.150
Chase: Super grateful for having me on the
show.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.150
Thank you.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.150
Tom: Guys.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.559
That last little bit of mental jiu jitsu that
he did there at the end, where don't think

00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:20.059
about it from a fear perspective, start thinking
about what an incredible opportunity you're

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:21.981
living through right now in this world.

00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:26.369
That is Chase Jarvis, that is what you're
gonna find as you go deeper into his world,

00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:28.240
and realize that that is what this man is
about.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.799
He looks at the world with just a fresh set
of eyes and sees solutions that other people

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:32.950
don't see.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:38.150
That's why as you dive into his content, he
is going to slowly draw you into a world that

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.450
will change you if you let it.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.119
Trust me, it is amazing.

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:45.890
I am very sad that we didn't get a change
to talk about Kate and a lot of other amazing

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:46.890
things.

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:51.549
I'm telling you, what we touched on here today
is a tip of an iceberg, that has just an abundance

00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:53.630
of give to it.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:57.940
It is going to offer you things that you can't
even imagine, so please take him up on it,

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.430
dive into his content, see what it's all about.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.640
It's really really impactful and it's coming
from somebody who is truly a master of his

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640
game.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.369
Speaking on behalf of Creative Live, which
I am not in any way, shape or form affiliated

00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:10.910
with, but they have some of the greatest teachers
on the planet.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.599
People that have won Pulitzer Prizes I think.

00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:16.119
Richard Branson talked about that and in the
intro.

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:19.660
Dive into it man, it's free.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.660
That's how you change the world.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.990
You get out and you do stuff.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.770
You do stuff, you do stuff.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.119
Chase Jarvis is a master of getting things
done.
