00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
why not and what is the approach
 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.629 align:start position:0%
why not and what is the approach
that<00:05:01.120><c> you</c><00:05:01.280><c> take</c>

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
that you take
 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.909 align:start position:0%
that you take
well<00:05:02.880><c> i</c><00:05:02.960><c> think</c><00:05:03.120><c> the</c><00:05:03.280><c> first</c><00:05:03.440><c> thing</c><00:05:03.680><c> is</c><00:05:03.759><c> that</c>

um<00:09:28.720><c> so</c><00:09:28.959><c> i</c><00:09:29.120><c> might</c><00:09:29.360><c> plant</c><00:09:29.600><c> some</c><00:09:29.920><c> seeds</c>

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
um so i might plant some seeds
 

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
um so i might plant some seeds
and<00:09:31.839><c> so</c><00:09:32.000><c> that's</c><00:09:32.240><c> sort</c><00:09:32.480><c> of</c><00:09:32.560><c> the</c><00:09:33.040><c> the</c><00:09:33.279><c> timing</c><00:09:33.680><c> and</c>

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's sort of the the timing and
 

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.590 align:start position:0%
and so that's sort of the the timing and
then<00:09:33.920><c> the</c><00:09:34.080><c> dosage</c><00:09:34.480><c> is</c><00:09:34.560><c> how</c><00:09:34.800><c> much</c><00:09:35.200><c> you</c><00:09:35.360><c> know</c><00:09:35.440><c> how</c>

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
then the dosage is how much you know how
 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.030 align:start position:0%
then the dosage is how much you know how

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.509 align:start position:0%

and<00:09:39.440><c> so</c><00:09:39.680><c> you</c><00:09:39.760><c> know</c><00:09:39.920><c> i</c><00:09:40.160><c> i</c><00:09:40.560><c> have</c><00:09:40.720><c> a</c><00:09:40.959><c> quote</c><00:09:41.279><c> in</c><00:09:41.360><c> the</c>

we're so reactive right so like you know
 

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
we're so reactive right so like you know
someone<00:18:33.600><c> says</c><00:18:33.760><c> something</c><00:18:34.080><c> or</c><00:18:34.240><c> does</c><00:18:34.480><c> something</c>

we make meaning of it in the moment and
 

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.590 align:start position:0%
we make meaning of it in the moment and
we<00:18:37.360><c> impulsively</c><00:18:38.080><c> react</c><00:18:38.880><c> and</c><00:18:39.039><c> so</c><00:18:39.200><c> if</c><00:18:39.360><c> you</c><00:18:39.440><c> can</c>

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
we impulsively react and so if you can

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.349 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with that loss
and<00:46:21.280><c> then</c><00:46:21.760><c> how</c><00:46:21.920><c> do</c><00:46:22.000><c> you</c><00:46:22.240><c> use</c><00:46:22.480><c> the</c><00:46:22.720><c> freedom</c><00:46:23.119><c> that</c>

00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
and then how do you use the freedom that
 

00:46:23.359 --> 00:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
and then how do you use the freedom that
you<00:46:23.520><c> have</c><00:46:23.839><c> now</c><00:46:24.400><c> to</c><00:46:24.560><c> create</c><00:46:25.119><c> the</c><00:46:25.280><c> kind</c><00:46:25.520><c> of</c>

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
you have now to create the kind of
 

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.910 align:start position:0%
you have now to create the kind of

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
worked out perfectly
 

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.349 align:start position:0%
worked out perfectly
and<00:46:49.119><c> i</c><00:46:49.200><c> think</c><00:46:49.440><c> it's</c><00:46:49.599><c> helping</c><00:46:50.160><c> people</c><00:46:50.480><c> to</c><00:46:50.720><c> see</c><00:46:51.280><c> a</c>

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
and i think it's helping people to see a
 

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:54.710 align:start position:0%
and i think it's helping people to see a

more balanced view of their lives um and
 

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.349 align:start position:0%
more balanced view of their lives um and
i<00:46:54.800><c> think</c><00:46:54.960><c> it's</c><00:46:55.200><c> also</c><00:46:55.520><c> to</c><00:46:55.680><c> help</c><00:46:55.920><c> them</c><00:46:56.240><c> see</c><00:46:56.880><c> the</c>

00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's also to help them see the

i think it's also to help them see the
