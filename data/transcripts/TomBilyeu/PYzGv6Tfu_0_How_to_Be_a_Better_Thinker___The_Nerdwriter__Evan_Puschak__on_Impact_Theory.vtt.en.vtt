00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
work on child B yeah so now what so in
 

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
work on child B yeah so now what so in
that<00:19:14.230><c> and</c><00:19:14.470><c> that</c><00:19:14.500><c> was</c><00:19:14.740><c> actually</c><00:19:14.860><c> really</c>

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:15.190 align:start position:0%
that and that was actually really
 

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.350 align:start position:0%
that and that was actually really
interesting<00:19:15.520><c> so</c><00:19:15.610><c> like</c><00:19:15.730><c> my</c><00:19:15.850><c> sister</c><00:19:16.180><c> and</c><00:19:16.270><c> I</c><00:19:16.300><c> grew</c>

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.850 align:start position:0%

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
up in the same household very different

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:19.330 align:start position:0%
outcomes so you know we had the same
 

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
outcomes so you know we had the same
parents<00:19:20.070><c> but</c><00:19:21.070><c> some</c><00:19:21.550><c> things</c><00:19:21.700><c> work</c><00:19:21.880><c> really</c><00:19:22.090><c> well</c>

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:22.270 align:start position:0%

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
parents but some things work really well
for<00:19:22.330><c> me</c><00:19:22.600><c> and</c><00:19:22.810><c> then</c><00:19:22.930><c> some</c><00:19:23.110><c> things</c><00:19:23.290><c> work</c><00:19:23.470><c> really</c>

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
for me and then some things work really
 

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
for me and then some things work really
well<00:19:23.830><c> for</c><00:19:23.890><c> her</c><00:19:24.100><c> and</c><00:19:24.460><c> but</c><00:19:24.610><c> they</c><00:19:24.790><c> weren't</c><00:19:25.000><c> there</c>

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.330 align:start position:0%

yeah and then there's like this area
that<00:26:41.090><c> does</c><00:26:41.480><c> an</c><00:26:41.660><c> overlap</c><00:26:41.990><c> where</c><00:26:42.230><c> we</c><00:26:42.350><c> see</c><00:26:42.560><c> things</c>

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:42.830 align:start position:0%
that does an overlap where we see things
