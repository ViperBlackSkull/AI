00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
right so i figured that if i had been

right so i figured that if i had been

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.110 align:start position:0%
my diet maybe until i was like six or
seven<00:27:19.840><c> i</c><00:27:20.000><c> think</c><00:27:20.159><c> i</c><00:27:20.320><c> probably</c><00:27:20.640><c> would</c><00:27:20.880><c> have</c><00:27:20.960><c> been</c>
