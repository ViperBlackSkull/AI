00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
unwind that so i i'm assuming you
 

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
unwind that so i i'm assuming you
literally<00:19:18.240><c> walk</c><00:19:18.480><c> yourself</c><00:19:18.720><c> through</c><00:19:18.960><c> that</c><00:19:19.120><c> so</c>

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
literally walk yourself through that so
 

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.630 align:start position:0%

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
so i guess i guess that would be the
 

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.870 align:start position:0%
so i guess i guess that would be the

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.029 align:start position:0%
second step you know first step
lose<00:25:19.120><c> the</c><00:25:19.279><c> certainty</c><00:25:19.840><c> second</c><00:25:20.159><c> step</c><00:25:20.720><c> is</c><00:25:20.799><c> to</c>

00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
lose the certainty second step is to
 

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:22.710 align:start position:0%
lose the certainty second step is to
