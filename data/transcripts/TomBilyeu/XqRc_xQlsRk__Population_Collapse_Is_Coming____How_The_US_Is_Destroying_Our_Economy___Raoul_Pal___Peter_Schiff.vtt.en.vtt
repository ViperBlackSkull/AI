do you guys think the price of Bitcoin
 

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.630 align:start position:0%
do you guys think the price of Bitcoin
is<00:17:52.440><c> going</c><00:17:52.520><c> to</c><00:17:52.640><c> be</c><00:17:53.320><c> well</c><00:17:53.600><c> I</c><00:17:53.679><c> would</c><00:17:53.880><c> guess</c><00:17:54.120><c> lower</c>

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be well I would guess lower
 

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.110 align:start position:0%
is going to be well I would guess lower
actually<00:17:54.880><c> it's</c><00:17:55.039><c> gone</c><00:17:55.240><c> up</c><00:17:55.400><c> so</c><00:17:55.600><c> much</c><00:17:55.799><c> at</c><00:17:55.960><c> this</c>

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
actually it's gone up so much at this
 

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.909 align:start position:0%
actually it's gone up so much at this
point<00:17:56.440><c> 6</c><00:17:56.640><c> months</c><00:17:56.880><c> from</c><00:17:57.039><c> now</c><00:17:57.440><c> my</c><00:17:57.600><c> my</c><00:17:57.720><c> guess</c>

00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
point 6 months from now my my guess
 

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.830 align:start position:0%
point 6 months from now my my guess
would<00:17:58.039><c> be</c><00:17:58.200><c> lower</c><00:17:58.559><c> it's</c><00:17:58.799><c> it's</c><00:17:58.919><c> about</c><00:17:59.120><c> 60,000</c>

00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
would be lower it's it's about 60,000
 

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.510 align:start position:0%
would be lower it's it's about 60,000
now<00:18:00.080><c> right</c><00:18:00.679><c> 61,000</c><00:18:01.600><c> so</c><00:18:02.039><c> i'</c><00:18:02.200><c> take</c><00:18:02.400><c> the</c><00:18:02.520><c> under</c>

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
now right 61,000 so i' take the under
 

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.909 align:start position:0%
now right 61,000 so i' take the under
for<00:18:03.720><c> 6</c><00:18:03.960><c> months</c><00:18:04.679><c> I'll</c><00:18:05.039><c> take</c><00:18:05.240><c> the</c><00:18:05.360><c> over</c><00:18:05.640><c> just</c><00:18:05.799><c> on</c>

00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
for 6 months I'll take the over just on
 

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.590 align:start position:0%
