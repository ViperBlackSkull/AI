because i don't know any better
 

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.230 align:start position:0%
because i don't know any better
so<00:20:42.000><c> when</c><00:20:42.320><c> i</c><00:20:42.640><c> am</c><00:20:42.799><c> performing</c><00:20:43.280><c> these</c><00:20:43.520><c> actions</c>

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
so when i am performing these actions
 

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.350 align:start position:0%
so when i am performing these actions
and<00:20:44.480><c> getting</c><00:20:44.799><c> this</c><00:20:45.039><c> feedback</c><00:20:46.000><c> it</c><00:20:46.159><c> tells</c><00:20:46.640><c> me</c>

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
and getting this feedback it tells me
 

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
and getting this feedback it tells me
what<00:20:47.520><c> i'm</c><00:20:47.679><c> good</c><00:20:47.919><c> at</c><00:20:48.080><c> and</c><00:20:48.240><c> where</c><00:20:48.400><c> i</c><00:20:48.480><c> should</c><00:20:48.720><c> put</c>

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm good at and where i should put
 

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.710 align:start position:0%
what i'm good at and where i should put
more<00:20:49.120><c> of</c><00:20:49.280><c> my</c><00:20:49.440><c> energy</c><00:20:49.760><c> to</c><00:20:50.000><c> and</c><00:20:50.159><c> where</c><00:20:50.400><c> i</c><00:20:50.480><c> should</c>

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
more of my energy to and where i should
 

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.870 align:start position:0%
more of my energy to and where i should
divert<00:20:51.440><c> my</c><00:20:51.600><c> energy</c>

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
divert my energy
 

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
divert my energy
so<00:20:53.039><c> i</c><00:20:53.200><c> think</c><00:20:53.360><c> that's</c><00:20:53.600><c> really</c><00:20:53.840><c> important</c><00:20:54.320><c> is</c><00:20:54.640><c> is</c>

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that's really important is is
 

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
so i think that's really important is is
knowing<00:20:55.520><c> not</c><00:20:55.679><c> only</c><00:20:55.919><c> what</c><00:20:56.080><c> you're</c><00:20:56.240><c> good</c><00:20:56.400><c> at</c><00:20:56.559><c> and</c>

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
knowing not only what you're good at and
 

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.390 align:start position:0%
knowing not only what you're good at and
what<00:20:56.799><c> you</c><00:20:57.039><c> like</c><00:20:57.280><c> but</c><00:20:57.440><c> what</c><00:20:57.600><c> you</c><00:20:57.840><c> don't</c><00:20:58.080><c> like</c>

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
what you like but what you don't like
 

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.750 align:start position:0%
what you like but what you don't like
and<00:20:58.559><c> so</c><00:20:58.720><c> look</c><00:20:58.960><c> for</c><00:20:59.280><c> models</c><00:21:00.159><c> get</c><00:21:00.640><c> feedback</c>

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so look for models get feedback
 

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.470 align:start position:0%
and so look for models get feedback
and<00:21:02.000><c> then</c><00:21:02.320><c> really</c><00:21:02.960><c> really</c><00:21:03.440><c> think</c><00:21:03.679><c> about</c>

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
and then really really think about
