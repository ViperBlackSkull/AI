Tom: Everybody welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.950
You are here because like me you believe that
human potential is nearly limitless but you

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.930
know that having potential is not the same
as actually doing something with it.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.040
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.580
are going to help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.500
All right, today’s guest is one of the most
popular on air commentators and opinion writers

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.640
for CNN and her unique brand of raw and relatable
advice has made her one of the most sought

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.230
after speakers and media personalities.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.660
Watching her you get the feeling that this
mother of three is just getting started.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.070
Her well researched and really powerful insights
into what it means to be a human come wrapped

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.950
in both science and lovely mid-western charm,
allowing her to cut through the formality

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.469
of typical business jargon and grab her audiences
by the emotions.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.280
She has made a name for herself by being;
blunt, unapologetic and yet totally vulnerable.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
She says what everybody is already thinking
but is just a little too scared to say and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.409
it makes people absolutely love her.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.079
It is not hard to understand why her Ted Talk
titled; how to stop screwing yourself over

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.090
is one of the most watched Ted Talks of all
time.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.479
It’s also easy to see why she is an award
winning talk radio host who is trusted by

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.039
some of the biggest brands on the planet to
help motivate and advice their teams.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.679
She has appeared on everything from Good Morning
America and The Today Show to Dr. Phil and

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:35.679
Oprah.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.279
Somehow she has also made time to found an
inspirational news site called inspire52.com

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.359
and found and sell a retail and internet tech
company.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:51.240
Please help me in welcoming the former criminal
defense attorney who has been called an explosion

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.639
of inspiration.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.639
The bestselling author with a brand new book
titled; The 5 Second Rule.

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.319
The master of motivation herself; Mel Robbins.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.439
It’s really good to have you on the show.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.710
Mel: Oh my gosh thank you.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.710
Tom: Absolutely.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.450
Mel: You called me the master of motivation
and I think motivation is complete garbage

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790
so maybe we should start there.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.000
Tom: That is a perfect place to start so I
totally agree with you but why do you say

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Mel: You do?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Tom: I do 100%.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.180
Now I said that in the spirit of I know what
you are trying to do so it is meant with absolute

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.100
reverence, but why do you say that it’s
garbage?

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.600
Mel: Well and we’ll talk a lot about this
but I think it’s garbage because at some

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.260
point we all bought into this lie that you’ve
got to feel ready in order to change.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.110
We bought into this complete falsehood that
at some point you are going to have the courage,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.590
at some point you are going to have the confidence
and it’s total bullshit frankly.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.290
Are we allowed to swear on this show?

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.290
Mel: Absolutely.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.020
Tom: Okay, it’s complete garbage so there
are so many people in the world and you may

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.980
be watching this right now and you have these
incredible ideas and what you think is missing

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.930
is motivation and that’s not true.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.500
Because the way that our minds are wired and
the fact about human beings is that we are

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.660
not designed to do things that are uncomfortable
or scary or difficult.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.080
Our brains are designed to protect us from
those things, because our brains are trying

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.690
to keep us alive.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.850
In order to change, in order to build a business,
in order to be the best parent, the best spouse

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.580
to do all those things that you know you want
to do with your life, with your work, with

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.710
your dreams you are going to have to do things
that are; difficult, uncertain or scary.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.410
Which sets up this problem for all of us,
you are never going to feel like it.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.290
Motivation is garbage, you only feel motivated
to do the things that are easy right?

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.430
Tom: Why do you think that is?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.040
Mel: I know exactly why that is because I’ve
studied this so much, because for me one of

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:08.650
the hardest things to figure out was why is
it so hard to do the little things that would

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.330
improve my life.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.850
What I’ve come to realize and what we’ll
talk a lot about today is that the way that

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:24.120
our minds are designed is our minds are designed
to stop you at all cost from doing anything

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.130
that might hurt you.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.069
The way that this all happens is it all starts
with something super subtle that none of us

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:40.449
ever catch and that is with this habit that
all of us have that nobody is talking about.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.590
We all have a habit of hesitating.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.521
We have an idea you are sitting in a meeting
you have this incredible idea and instead

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:54.540
of just saying it you stop and you hesitate.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.759
Now what none of us realize is that when you
hesitate just that moment that micro moment,

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.889
that small hesitation it sends a stress signal
to your brain.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.580
It wakes your brain up and your brain all
of a sudden goes, “Wait a minute why is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.770
he hesitating he didn’t hesitate when he
put on his killer spiky sneakers, he didn’t

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.569
hesitate with the really cool track pants,
he didn’t hesitate with a NASA t-shirt now

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.909
he’s hesitating to talk something must be
up.”

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.159
Then your brain goes to work to protect you,
it has a million different ways to protect

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.289
you one of them is called the spotlight effect.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.479
It’s a known phenomenon where your brain
magnifies risk, why?

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.169
To pull you away from something that it perceives
to be a problem.

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:40.110
You can truly trace every single problem or
complaint in your life to silence and hesitation,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.159
those are decisions.

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:47.370
What I do and what’s changed my life is
waking up and realizing that motivation is

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.310
garbage I’m never going to feel like doing
the things that are; tough or difficult or

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.610
uncertain or scary or new so I need to stop
waiting until I feel like it.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.659
Number two, I am one decision away from; a
totally different marriage, a totally different

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:07.599
life, a totally different job, a totally different
income, a totally different relationship with

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:08.819
my kids.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:16.169
Not like one decision I’m divorcing you
in a marriage example but one decision on,

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.449
you could be having a conversation with your
spouse and you feel your emotions rise up

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:29.069
and within a tiny window those emotions can
take over and can impact how your marriage

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.930
goes.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.150
You can learn how to take control of that
micro moment and make a decision to act in

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.419
a way that actually shifts your marriage.

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.559
Your life comes down to your decisions and
if you change your decisions you will change

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:45.689
everything.

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:53.360
Tom: That core concept comes through so powerfully
in your book which is phenomenal and I would

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.180
love it if you would take a second to tell
people the story of how, and by the way I

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.129
wore the NASA shirt because of the imagery.

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.680
Mel: Oh is that why you wore it?

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680
Tom: Of course.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.020
Mel: Oh my God I’ve like falling my glasses
off that is, I did not even get that.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.210
I was going to ask you why you wore that shirt
oh my gosh, wow.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.210
Tom: Break it down.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.330
Mel: You actually do your homework.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.160
Tom: Of course Mel absolutely.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.689
Mel: Let me just take you back, so what you
are talking about is the five second rule

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:24.129
which has become literally my life’s work
and it was all a gigantic mistake.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:32.789
I read up on you too and understand how quest
like was born out of misery.

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:39.290
The five second rule and my life now and my
20 year marriage and everything that I’m

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.580
doing and the companies that I’ve built
and sold and the company I’m building now,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:48.199
it all comes back to a point in my life that
completely and utterly blew.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:56.620
I was 41 years old I was unemployed, my husband
had started a restaurant business which was

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.099
his dream this is actually a funny story.

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:03.069
When he got laid off from a big job in high
tech and I think he was really relieved, you

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:07.279
know how a lot of us wait to quit our jobs
and then we get laid off and are like, “Yes.”

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.430
He said, “I’m not going to look for a
job I’m going to go into the restaurant

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.879
business,” and I think I said the most famous
lines of our marriage at that point.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:19.009
I looked at him and I said, “Listen buddy
inspiration is for strangers you get your

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:23.719
butt back to that job and you pay the mortgage.”

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:25.180
Again micro moment where …
Tom: That is amazing.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.599
Mel: ... I’m being a jerk instead of being
a supportive wife.

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:31.849
That’s an example of where when he said
he was not going to go get a job but he was

00:08:31.849 --> 00:08:36.500
going to start a business, the first thing
that was there was fear.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.260
Fear was making the decision for me.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.151
Tom: God I love that you could share that
though, that’s so powerful.

00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:45.330
Mel: What happened is the first restaurant
was a home run and of course what do you do

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.330
when things are successful?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.130
You grow it, you grow it really big.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:55.070
They decided to raise money and we threw in
our home equity line, the kid’s college

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.600
savings, they tried to open a second and a
third and at the same point a grocery store

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
chain.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.880
I encouraged them to go into wholesale, so
it basically got way too big way too first

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.690
and the wheel started to come off.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:14.430
They came off so badly that the second restaurant
failed and they held on to it for too long

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.570
like a lot of us do.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.780
It’s another trick our brains play on us
called [inaudible 00:09:18].

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.320
When you throw a ton of time and a ton of
money at something it’s really hard to let

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.570
go of it and if you haven’t done it in business,
we all had a relationship in our past stayed

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.970
way too long that was a trick your brain played
on you.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.110
By the time that they closed the second restaurant
it was an $800,000 loss.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.330
Tom: Whoa.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.570
Mel: I mean that meant our entire home equity
line gone.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:47.450
It meant kid’s college, I just choked just
thinking about how terrifying it was.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:54.650
I found myself at the age of 41 like just
feeling like a complete failure and so did

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.750
Chris.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:02.780
To make it worse not only had we lost all
of our savings, but so many friends and family

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.180
members had invested so there was this real
tension between the truth of what was happening

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:15.230
and what you had to do in public because it
was public business; shame, failure, embarrassment

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.850
and the lien started to hit the house.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.720
The phone started to ring and it was nothing
but collection calls.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:28.180
I just remember feeling this tremendous shame
and at some point I think we all hit that

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.680
moment in life where things just are not going
how you thought they would go.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.000
What’s amazing about those moments is we
all respond very differently.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.440
My husband he would spring out of bed and
he would head right out that door six o’clock

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.740
in the morning and he would go meet his partner
and they would go to the bank and they would

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.350
dig right in and they would face their problems
head on.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.840
He is also a smart guy I mean he did not want
to be in the house when yours truly woke up

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.240
because I was a raging bitch at that point
in our lives.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.800
The reason why is because when you are scared
and you are afraid and you are jealous and

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.220
you are overwhelmed with emotions, it is so
much easier to point the finger at other people.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.880
That’s a decision by the way one you may
not be aware that you are making but you are

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.750
still making it.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.420
What would happen to me is the exact opposite,
is Chris would be gone the alarm would go

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.540
off at six o’clock in the morning and I
would lie there.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.810
I would think about the lien on the house
and I would think about the bankruptcy that

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:36.051
we were facing and I would think about how
much we had fought the night before and I

00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:39.700
would think about the fact that I was unemployed.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:46.080
I would hit the snooze button I mean why would
you get up when your life is like that?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.140
Why would you?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.870
I needed confidence, I needed courage I was
so tapped out.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.160
In the scheme of life hitting the snooze button
is not that big of a deal but here is the

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.700
thing about life; none of us wake up and say,
“Today is the day I destroy my life.”

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:11.750
What we do is we kind of check out because
it feels overwhelming or we check out because

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.690
we’re afraid or we check out because we
start listening to self-doubt and then we

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:21.810
make these teeny-tiny decisions all day long
and we don’t even realize it.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.830
Decision to not get up on time, a decision
to not eat the right thing, a decision to

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.700
snap at your kids, a decision to not speak
at a meeting, a decision to not look for a

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.021
job, a decision to not deal with your finances,
a decision to not call your parents like whatever

00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:35.720
it is.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.520
All day long these tiny decisions that take
you so far off track and then you wake up

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.230
like I did and you look at your life and you
think, “How the hell did I get here,”

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.360
and more importantly how do you get back over
there and you have no idea.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.650
I was to strapped and I know from your story
you felt the same way, like you knew that

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:01.390
there was more in store for you but you couldn’t
figure how do you close that gap.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.500
How do you find the power that’s in you,
how do you discover your greatness, how do

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.300
you solve these problems I feel so overwhelming.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:15.520
When you can … I mean I would go to the
grocery store and the items would scan and

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:23.170
I would be sitting readying my excuse because
there was no way that my check card was going

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.620
to clear.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.080
Tom: Wow.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:33.040
Mel: I got in this struggle with myself that
a lot of us find ourselves in and that is

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.570
you get trapped in what I call the knowledge-action
gap.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:43.130
You know what to do but you can’t seem to
make yourself do it.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:48.270
I mean every one of us is one Google search
away from a list of instructions that if you

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.190
follow any of them …
Tom: That’s a really good point.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.040
Mel: ... it will change your life.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.300
How do you get out of your head and stop thinking
about what you need to do and actually do

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.300
it.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.881
In my case this stuff was pretty easy; get
up on time, make breakfast for the kids, get

00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:11.690
them on the bus, start looking for a job,
be nicer to Chris, don’t drink so much.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.870
Instead of isolating yourself pick up the
phone and call a friend, get yourself out

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.150
into the woods and go for a walk, start running
again.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:26.001
Like all these little things that I was capable
of but I couldn’t get out of here, could

00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:29.350
not get out of here and if you are stuck that’s
the problem.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.370
The problem is you are in your head, your
thinking.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.380
That is the universal problem and it all starts
with this knowledge of what to do and then

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.820
you hesitate and you think about whether or
not you feel like doing it.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.870
For a couple of months I was really stuck,
Chris would get up at six I’d hit the snooze

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.370
and then I’d hit the snooze and then I hit
the snooze the kids would miss the bus.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.560
Then every night I’d do the same thing I’d
go in bed, have ever had one of those nights

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:58.800
probably before you started your company where
you would go in bed and you are like, “All

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.990
right Tom that’s it tomorrow it’s the
new me, tomorrow.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:10.800
Tomorrow I am going to get up on time, I am
going to go to the gym, I am going to look

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.820
for a job, I’m not going to drink so much
it’s going to be amazing.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.210
The new me, the future me whoa let’s do
this,” right?

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.365
Then you go to bed and you wake up seven hours
later and you are like, “I don’t feel

00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:23.550
like the new me.”

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.760
Tom: Who was that?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.790
Mel: Who the, that’s the stupidest … See
motivation is garbage, it’s never there

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.210
when you need it ever.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:35.810
Here is what happened to me and thank you
for wearing the NASA t-shirt.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.810
Tom: Of course.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.160
Mel: It’s a really stupid story.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.000
Tom: It’s a powerful story.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.850
Mel: One night Chris had gone to bed I had
been struggling, we still had all the same

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.320
problems.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.340
I we still had the lien on the house, still
facing bankruptcy, still fighting like crazy,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.200
I was still unemployed.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.210
They still hadn’t figured out the solution
yet for the business and I was about to turn

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.250
off the TV.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:08.550
There on the TV there was this rocket launching
and I thought, “Oh my gosh that is it.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:17.120
I am going to launch myself out of bed like
a rocket ship like NASA right here and launch

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
me out of that bed.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.390
I’m going to move so fast that I don’t
think.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.790
I’m going to beat my brain.”

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:30.420
Now here is a really interesting point, I
talk a lot about your instincts and inner

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.720
wisdom and we can get into this a little bit
later.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.810
A lot of us talk about the fact that you have
a gut feeling, but what all these research

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.840
that I’ve done for the book and all the
speaking that I do.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.950
What I’ve discovered that’s fascinating
is actually when you set goals, when you have

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.740
an intention on something that you want to
change about your life your brain helps you.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.280
What it does is it opens up a check list and
then your brain goes to work trying to remind

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.830
you of that intention that you set.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:05.669
It’s really important to develop the skill
and I say that word purposefully, the skill

00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:11.550
of knowing how to hear that inner wisdom and
that intention kicking in and leaning into

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.030
it quickly.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:19.170
For me my brain saying, “That’s it right
there move as fast as rocket Mel,” I wanted

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.860
to change my life.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:27.530
I think most people that are miserable or
that are really dying to be great and dying

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.710
to have more; we want to change, we want to
live a better life, we want to create more

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.560
for our families, we want to be happier.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.740
The desire is there again it’s about how
do you go from knowledge to action.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.650
The first thing in this story that’s important
is realizing that the answer was in me and

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.230
my mind was telling me, “Pay attention.”

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.180
Could have also been the bourbon I mean I
had had a couple of Manhattans that night.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:59.740
Anyway, the next morning the alarm goes off
and I pretend that NASA was there.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.260
It’s the stupidest story I literally went;
five, four, three, two, one I counted out

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.470
loud and then I stood up.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:13.990
I’ll never forget standing there in my bedroom;
it was dark, it was cold, it was winter in

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.880
Boston.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.520
For the first time in three months I had beaten
my habit of hitting the snooze button.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.660
I couldn’t believe it and I thought, “Wait
a minute counting backwards that is the dumbest

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.809
thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life.”

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.770
Well the next morning I used it again and
it worked.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.720
The next morning I used it again and it worked.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.820
The next morning I used it and it worked.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:44.260
Then I started to notice something really
interesting, there were moments all day long

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:53.620
just like that five second moment in bed where
I knew knowledge what I should do.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:19:00.150
If I didn’t move within five seconds my
brain would step in and talk me out of it.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.410
Every human being has a five second window
might even be shorter for you, you have about

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:11.510
a five second window in which you can move
from idea to action before your brain kicks

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:17.670
in to full gear and sabotages any change in
behavior.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.630
Remember your brain is wired to stop you from
doing things that are uncomfortable or uncertain

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.880
or scary.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:30.240
It’s your job to learn how to move from
those ideas that could change everything into

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.860
acting on them in the smallest moment.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:38.570
Tom: For anyone right now at home who is thinking
like this sounds too simple, too easy.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:44.520
Talk a bit about your community, because reading
some of their comments it’s crazy how many

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.380
people like the sheer volume of the people
you quote in your book.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.100
If you also go online and just look at the
people that are directly reaching out to you,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.390
it is an avalanche of people that have stories
around the five second rule.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.680
Mel: One of the reasons why I’m so excited
about this book and look you don’t have

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.710
to buy the book this is an idea that you can
use it’s free it’s backed by science,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.270
more than eight million people around the
world have discovered it.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.810
You are talking about the number of people
we’ve heard from more than a hundred thousand

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.250
people in 80 countries …
Tom: That’s crazy.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.820
Mel: ... that are using this rule.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.520
We know of 11 people who have stopped themselves
from killing themselves using this rule.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.410
Tom: I saw one of those outreaches which is
…

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.100
Mel: There is a guy Steve who wrote to us
who was a veteran.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.140
He was suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder, he boarded a ferry overseas with

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.300
the intention to jump over.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:40.929
He walked over the railing and his inner wisdom
kicked in.

00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:45.650
In that moment the five second rule; five,
four, three, two, one counting backwards moved

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.940
away from the railing asked for help saved
his life.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.960
His story has inspired countless other people
that have heard me in the speeches that I

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.370
give around the world about this one tool.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.610
The thing that’s so cool about this, and
I should tell you the science behind it because

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.510
I’m going to be honest with you it is stupid.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:12.120
Had I ever thought that I would find myself
eight years after discovering it spending

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.250
my days telling people about the five second
rule, first of all I would have picked a different

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.480
name because it reminds you of the one where
you have to pick up food in five seconds off

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.530
the floor.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.580
Tom: Yeah.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:29.240
Mel: It was my secret weapon this was something
I did, I never intended to tell anybody.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.160
I went from getting up on time and waking
up on time to shaking up my entire life.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.530
Because when you understand the power of a
five second decision and you understand that

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.650
you always have a choice to go from autopilot
to decision maker everything in your life

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.650
will change.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.010
You will be a different negotiator, you will
different in sales, you will be unstoppable

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:55.230
on the gym because you will realize the amount
of garbage that you put in the way; of your

00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.670
hopes, of your dreams, of your potential,
of your confidence, of your courage.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.429
Everything comes down to the decision that
you make.

00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:09.330
We all know what to do none of us know how
to make ourselves do it.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.320
I started researching it why does something
so stupid work, why?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.790
Why does something so silly create such powerful
and profound change?

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.290
Well here is why, the rule is a form of metacognition.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.540
Metacognition is a fancy pants term that means
something real simple; you can out smart your

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.250
own brain in furtherance of goals.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.250
Tom: Agree.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.770
Mel: There are tricks that you can use that
actually outsmart the tricks your brain plays

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.220
on you.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:45.820
In furtherance of a higher purpose we all
know this, you can restrain yourself if you

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.170
are in a situation that calls for it.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:55.370
You can jump into a raging river to save your
dog or your kid, you can direct yourself in

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.460
ways if it’s important to you.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.470
The rule what it does is it does something
really remarkable.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:09.100
When you count backwards; five, four, three,
two, one what you are actually doing is you

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:15.690
are interrupting what researchers call habit
loops that get in coded as close loop patterns

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.720
in your basal ganglia.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.990
That’s the part of the brain where your
feelings, where your emotions every habit

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.940
that you have which is nothing more than behavior
that you repeat that you don’t even think

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.940
about.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.250
Tom: I’ve heard it referred to as a gear
box, because you shift your attention from

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.250
[inaudible 00:23:28].

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.920
Mel: Yes, so when you go; five, four, three,
two, one it interrupts what’s going on here

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:39.430
that’s spinning without you thinking and
it moves and awakens your prefrontal cortex.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:45.580
When you hit one your habit has been interrupted
so you’ve interrupted self-doubt, you’ve

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.350
interrupted maybe snapping at your kids, you’ve
interrupted the desire to grab for drink,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.880
you’ve interrupted procrastination.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:59.920
You’ve also by counting backwards done an
action, it awakens your prefrontal cortex

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.260
that is the part of the brain that’s awake
when you are changing behavior, when you are

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.510
learning new things.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.340
When you hit one it’s also a prompt.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:15.880
In the language of research you’ll hear
people talk about starting rituals, that is

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.240
something that’s proven to help you learn
a new habit.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.590
The five second rule when you repeat it becomes
a starting ritual that triggers you to act

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.679
with confidence, that triggers you that this
is a moment for courage, that triggers you

00:24:26.679 --> 00:24:28.720
to shift gears.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.400
Because you’ve also done the manual work
of awakening the part of the brain that you

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.190
need to change, you’ve set yourself up for
success.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.400
It doesn’t work if you count up because
you can keep going and also counting up doesn’t

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.809
require a focus.

00:24:41.809 --> 00:24:46.800
If you count backwards; five, four, three,
two, one it again awakens the prefrontal cortex

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.730
and it prompts you to move.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.280
When you start to use it and then you read
about it you’ll see that it’s being used

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.700
all over the place; they use it in the armed
services in order to align troops and get

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.179
them to start an exercise, they use it in
elementary schools; five, four, three, two,

00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:03.530
one at big assemblies to get a huge room full
of kids to stop talking.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.970
Tom: Exactly, a really simple and interesting
example yeah.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:10.150
Mel: Because it requires you to focus it’s
not a habit.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:14.940
It will become a habit that prompts you to
have confidence and courage, but in the beginning

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:20.490
it interrupts patterns of behavior that you
do on autopilot, it helps you assert control

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:25.170
and it teaches you how to become the kind
of person that moves from thinking about something

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.250
to actually doing it.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.980
Tom: It’s incredible so there is so many
things in that story and guys I’m telling

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.660
you it’s, you are going to love the depth
of brain research that is put in the book.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.840
It’s really quite extraordinary you really
have an amazing grasp of the brain and it

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.140
really, really came through in the book.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.590
For me it was a wonderful balancing act between
the raw emotion of the people writing in and

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.580
some of the stories that you are sharing and
the imagery of the rocket ship which you are

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.210
very open about.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:58.390
It’s sort of a silly visual metaphor, but
because it’s effective that silliness is

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.390
somewhat relevant.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:04.190
Mel: What’s incredible is in five seconds
flat self-doubt can take over and rob you

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:13.570
of your power and rob you of joy and rob you
of your potential or in five seconds flat

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:18.760
you can actually use one stupid little trick
to push yourself to grab it.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:24.320
Tom: What I loved in the book is because you
paint the picture so very well you are also

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.860
just a good writer, so you paint the picture
like I could feel the crisp winter air of

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:36.070
Boston stalking you out of the under the comforter.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:41.450
I could really feel that I was there with
you as Chris’ business is struggling, so

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.480
you really feel all of that.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.700
The moment when you do the countdown you spring
out of bed and you are almost like taking

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.610
yourself by surprise and you are like moving
before you realize it.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:55.100
But you are reading it from the perspective
of I already knew who you were, so it was

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.190
it gave me the chills.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:02.920
It was more difficult to picture you as stuck
than it was to know, “I know where she goes.”

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.760
I had already seen the Ted Talk by the time
I read the book, I knew what you were doing

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.010
from a media perspective, I knew how many
people and companies you would help.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:15.179
For me it was like watching it in reverse,
so I’m watching it from the safety of, “I

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:19.690
know she crushes,” it so if this is the
thing and I love that this isn’t your first

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.000
book.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.080
This was the secret that you planned to keep
hidden in the drawer forever.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.720
Mel: Yeah I was not going to tell anybody
because it was stupid and it also worked so

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.990
it was my thing and it’s not your thing.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:35.760
See the real thing that happened for me and
this is something that is a really important

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:42.340
topic for me, is that there is when you talk
about personality so extroverts, introverts

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:48.429
a lot of us really I know I did this I was
all wrong about what confidence meant.

00:27:48.429 --> 00:27:50.450
I thought confidence was a personality trait.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.110
Tom: I love this tell me more.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:58.810
Mel: I thought that people that are outgoing
are the confident ones and the truth is confidence

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.590
is not a personality trait at all, it’s
a skill.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.660
A lot of the extroverted people that you know
are actually very insecure, I used to become

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.660
of them.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.720
I used to be the kind of bossy class loud
mouth; that didn’t believe in myself, that

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.049
didn’t believe in my ideas, that didn’t
have the confidence and the courage to really

00:28:19.049 --> 00:28:24.280
be the real me; who I am, who I’m not flaws
and all.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:30.760
There are tremendous number of introverted
people that feel uncomfortable putting the

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.410
attention on themselves, but they are very,
very confident in their ideas.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.700
They definitely believe in themselves.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:44.350
When you start to separate confidence not
as a matter of personality but as a skill

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:50.650
that you can acquire because confidence is
the ability to move in my opinion from thought

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.230
to action.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:58.130
Because when you are a confident person you
believe enough in yourself and your capability

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.830
that you are willing to try, that you are
willing to share.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:07.980
To me confidence isn’t the assuredness that
it turns out, it’s the willingness to try

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.960
and that was a huge insight for me.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.980
What a lot of people don’t know about me
although I share this on stage and I’m extremely

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.580
open about this because this is a topic that’s
really important to me.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:29.930
The single most profound use of the five second
rule is mind control and I say that as a lawyer.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.760
I will tell you, you can use this stupid trick
to cure yourself of anxiety.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.130
Tom: Yeah I wanted to talk about that, so
you struggled very profoundly with anxiety

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.150
so walk us through some nuts and bolts of
how you use the five second rule.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.429
I think, so my hypothesis and he reason we
founded Impact Theory is that the world is

00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:51.309
living through two pandemics; the pandemic
of the body which everybody understands because

00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:58.590
it’s so visual; being overweight, dying
of diet related diseases such as diabetes.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.772
Because the second pandemic the pandemic of
the mind is invisible people don’t realize

00:30:03.772 --> 00:30:10.429
how pervasive a suicide is and I think it’s
the leading cause of death among young men

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:11.429
I mean it’s crazy.

00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:16.970
Then that there are ways that they can go
about attacking that and fixing the problem,

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.620
so walk us through that.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.460
Mel: Sure I would love to.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.890
First of all I literally have struggled with
anxiety my entire life and anxiety for this

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:31.830
conversation the way I define it is it is
the habit of worrying spiraled out of control.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:37.440
You may say that you are a worrier that’s
not true you have a habit of worrying.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.730
A habit is a pattern of behavior or thinking
that you repeat without realizing it.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:49.610
Anxiety happens when that pattern of worrying
about things spirals out of control and now

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:54.150
it starts to marry and manifest itself with
physical sensations too, that’s all that

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.190
it is.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.230
I know that I said that that’s all that
it is.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:02.970
Me personally I struggled with anxiety I think
my entire life, it became quite acute when

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:06.520
I was in my late teens and early twenties.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.600
I became medicated in the middle of law school
I took Zoloft for two decades.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.789
When our first daughter was born who is now
17 the postpartum depression and the cascading

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:21.480
panic was so terrible that not only was I
medicated and couldn’t breast feed, but

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.970
I couldn’t be left alone with her.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:23.970
Tom: Wow.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:29.280
Mel: When I say you can cure yourself of anxiety
I don’t say that lightly.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.651
Four years ago after I had been using the
five second rule to change my behavior; how

00:31:34.651 --> 00:31:39.370
I spoke to my husband, how I negotiate in
business meetings, how I conduct sales, the

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:44.850
kind of parent that I am, my health habits,
my eating habits, curbing the drinking.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:52.280
I thought, “I wonder if I can use this;
five, four, three, two, one thing to get control

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.720
of my thought patterns.”

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.980
Not my behavior patterns, my thought patterns
yes you can.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.980
Tom: Wow.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.231
Mel: We’re going to build this conversation
because I want to start with something that

00:32:03.231 --> 00:32:08.650
we can all relate to and that is how do you
stop worrying and how do you stop listening

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.059
to self-doubt, this is how you are going to
do it.

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:18.610
All day long you are going to have moments
where your thoughts drift and I use that word

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.850
on purpose.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:24.780
Because for me there is a physical sensation
when you start to use the five second rule

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:30.100
and you start to wake up, not only on time
in the morning but you wake up to your life

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.610
and the opportunities in your life.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.919
There is your thoughts drift, like you’ll
just be hanging out with your friends and

00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:38.960
then suddenly you are like, “I’m not sure
that that person likes me anymore.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.940
I haven’t heard from my kids lately I wonder
if they are dead or I was going to check,”

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.460
you just start worrying about stuff why?

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.990
Because it’s a habit.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.559
Because when you are not paying attention
your brain shifts from you being a decision

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:56.860
maker and paying attention to you just spending
things on autopilot and one of your habits

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.090
is worrying.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:03.049
The second you wake up and you notice, “Holy
cow I’m talking some negative garbage to

00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:08.299
myself right now,” five, four, three, two,
one you’ve just shifted the part of the

00:33:08.299 --> 00:33:10.330
brain that you are using.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.970
You have shifted from the basal ganglia which
is where your habit loops are spinning and

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.950
you have awakened your prefrontal cortex.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.080
You’ve also interrupted that pattern.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.470
Now what you are going to do because your
mind is actually ready to receive a different

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:30.970
thought because of the counting, now you can
put in an anchor thought.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:35.610
Like if you have a mantra, if you have a vision
about the way that your business is going

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.980
to turn out in five years.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:42.290
If you just have a thought that makes you
really happy and proud insert that.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.850
Now why does this work?

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:50.220
It works because of the counting and I’m
not kidding.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.860
We know based on research the positive thinking
alone not effective.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.630
In some instances trying to force yourself
to think positive can actually make the worries

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.410
worse, why?

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:06.090
Well the reason why is because it’s really
hard to just change the channel, what we have

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:11.720
to do first is basically interrupt it and
turn off the TV and then turn it back on with

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.820
the prefrontal cortex awakened, so the counting
is essential.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:22.090
You can start using this today, you catch
yourself talking garbage to yourself because

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:25.419
we all know if I were to put a speaker on
your head and broadcast you wouldn’t be

00:34:25.419 --> 00:34:29.030
sitting here in the audience you would be
in an insane asylum because the crap that

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.560
you say to yourself is insane.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.480
The problem is we listen to it, you’ll be
in a sales meeting and you’ll be undermining

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.300
yourself, “They are not going to buy oh
my gosh I’m in trouble,” you are not even

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.590
present; five, four, three, two, one switch
it back.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.780
Get back to that vision that you have about
toasting your success or this customer being

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.860
really happy or you being proud of yourself.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.669
Whatever that vision may be you can control
your thoughts and this is not just us talking

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:58.250
about it, this is a tool that you can use.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:05.060
Let’s take it a step further, so worrying
if you let it go unchecked what will happen

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.460
is you will get used to worrying.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.280
You will get used to living in a state where
you are slightly agitated all the time.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:17.460
Let me talk a little bit about agitation,
so what we know based on research is that

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:27.460
physically in your body so physiologically
being excited is the exact same thing as being

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.460
afraid.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:36.690
Let me say that again because it is so important;
in your body being excited is the exact same

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:37.940
thing as being afraid.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:42.970
Your body doesn’t know the damn difference;
your heart races, your armpits sweat, you

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:48.859
may get tight in your throat, you may your
cheeks may get pink like mine do when I get

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:50.520
excited.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.940
The only difference between excitement and
fear is what your brain says and the problem

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.600
is if you have a habit of worrying, guess
what you are going to tell yourself is going

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.760
on that you are freaking out.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.520
That you are not excited that something must
be wrong, oh gosh why would you say something

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.760
is wrong because you got a habit of saying
that all the time.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:15.080
Even as I became a speaker for a living where
I would be on CNN when I first started doing

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.620
it I would be freaking out back stage.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:27.210
Even though like just last week he is standing
back stage about to go on 8,000 people; heart

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:33.690
races, armpits sweat, my hands get clammy
I’m not nervous though not at all I’m

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:34.690
excited.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:39.370
I developed this technique and research out
of Harvard not based on my technique but something

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:45.210
very similar proofs that if you basically
right before you are about to do something;

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:50.800
take a test, run a race, pubic speaking, a
business negotiation, ask somebody to marry

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800
you.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.060
Whatever it may be that gets your heart racing
just do this go, “I’m excited.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.320
I’m excited to give that speech, I’m excited
to ask him or her, I’m excited to do this

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.690
race, I’m excited.”

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.950
What happens is you give your brain context
so your brain doesn’t escalate the stuff

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.080
going on in your body, your brain is not worried
makes sense?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080
Tom: Yeah.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.630
Mel: You can combine this with the five second
rule.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.160
We know how to do worrying you catch your
thoughts through a; five, four, three, two,

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.480
one anchor thought.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.790
If you start to feel your heart racing; five,
four, three, two, one to awaken the prefrontal

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:26.760
cortex and then start going, “I’m really
excited to do this.”

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:33.590
Another technique that you can use is ask
I think they call it interrogatory questions

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:38.420
where instead of giving yourself a pep talk
say, “Well why I’m I ready to do this?

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.520
Why I’m I ready?”

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.140
Because that will force you to answer the
question which then convinces you.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.830
“Why I’m I ready to close this sale, why
I’m I ready to give this speech, why I’m

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.830
I ready?”

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.400
Those are two strategies that you can use
backed by science that are proven to actually

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.119
make your performance be much better.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:38:00.680
Now let’s take it a step further to anxiety.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.050
Anxiety is what happens when the habit of
worrying spins out of control, your body gets

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:13.420
really agitated and then you allow your mind
to escalate it into a full blown panic attack.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.600
For those of you that have not had the pleasure
of having a panic attack let me explain what

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.600
it’s like.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.790
Have you ever been in your car and you are
driving down the road and you go to change

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.920
lanes and then all of a sudden there is like
oh my God there is a car right here.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.790
You swerve a little bit and then your heart
is like and you may sweat a little bit and

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:36.290
you grip the wheel really tight and you are
super locked in on the road ahead of you.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:42.150
Then that car pulls away and the near miss
scenario passes and your mind starts going,

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.510
“Okay you are all right now that’s it.”

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:50.350
That’s what a panic attack is only it happens
while you are standing in front of your coffee

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.619
pot, seriously.

00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:58.340
You have that same, “Oh my God [inaudible
00:38:55],” and your heart’s racing and

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:04.510
the problem for your brain is that your brain
can’t look around and say, “Holy cow we

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.940
almost got hit by a car.”

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.410
Your brain is saying, “What the hell is
wrong with her, she is making coffee and she

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.061
is freaking out,” so now your brain is the
problem because what’s our brain’s job

00:39:14.061 --> 00:39:17.450
it’s designed to protect you.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:22.650
Your brain will now do whatever it can to
magnify the problem remember we talked about

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.570
the spotlight effect.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.350
It will start telling you all kinds of crazy
stuff because it can’t figure out contextually,

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.450
“What the hell is going on she is just making
coffee now her heart is racing and she is

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:35.950
breathing really, holy cow maybe she is having
a heart attack.”

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.510
A lot of people that have panic attacks say,
“I think I’m dying oh my God what’s

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.330
happening,” or you see them do the deer
in the headlights thing where they got to

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.000
get out of the room.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.099
That is the spotlight effect in your brain
now taking control and magnifying everything

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.140
to get you out of whatever it was.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.660
Here is how you use the second rule; you use
it to stabilize your thoughts before the panic

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.660
escalates.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.960
Then what happens is it drifts into worry
and then it disappears.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.300
The second you feel worry you catch it you
train yourself to do that.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.720
If you start feeling yourself getting your
heat racing you can; five, four, three, two,

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.460
one and use the, “I’m excited, I’m excited.”

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:23.270
If that doesn’t work literally; five, four,
three, two, one and just give yourself an

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.359
anchor thought literally of you being okay.

00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:30.100
I’ll give you another quick example because
this is one that we have a tremendous number

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:34.420
of success with and people that hear the example
use it immediately and are blown away.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:40.060
I used to be terrified of flying, terrified
every bump I’d be freaking out.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:46.230
I started using this strategy with the plane,
so the second that you feel yourself getting

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.630
nervous; five, four, three, two, one and then
your anchor thought is a vision of what you

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.410
are going to do when you get to where you
are going.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.200
When I get on the plane tomorrow to fly back
to Boston I’ll think about walking in the

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.180
house and the place is like a disaster.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.720
It’ll look like everybody’s stuff got
loaded into a can and then fired all over

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.950
the first floor.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:09.830
If we hit turbulence; five, four, three, two,
one I’ll think about that vision because

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:15.540
cognitively for my brain if I’m walking
in the house and it’s a disaster the plane

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.589
made it that’s the power of this.

00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:19.589
It’s incredible.

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:24.360
Tom: What I love about you Mel is that a,
I love how raw and real you are about your

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.640
own situation which … Because people are
going to look at you and the first thing they

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.230
are going to want to do is make you extraordinary
way not to have to live up to your standard

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.330
because what you have accomplished really
is astonishing and seeing you on stage is

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:35.660
unbelievable.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:42.330
You are so good at that and I know that it
comes from working your ass off but wow it’s

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.330
very, very impressive.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.330
Mel: Thank you.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:50.260
Tom: Then that you use techniques like that
you’ve got answers for how have I done this

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.170
I’ve done it like this and I’ve had cast
sit across to me that that’s not their stake.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.540
Like they have done truly extraordinary things
with their life but they seem just like totally

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.160
blind to how they did it.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.750
The fact that you can walk people through
it is so cool.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:09.650
Mel: Well I think we are all flawed and that’s
the beauty of who you are.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:15.360
Instead of trying to make yourself perfect
in every area it’s so much easier when you

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.820
accept the things that you are terrible at
or that are your weaknesses or that are things

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.210
about your wiring.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:25.530
Look if I were diabetic I would take insulin
I happen to be somebody that’s wired for

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.340
anxiety no big deal.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:35.300
Figure out how to instead of fighting those
things actually trick it, because the truth

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.010
is that you are never going to feel ready
to make these changes.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:44.400
You are never going to feel like doing them
but you can always make a decision that’s

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.580
always in your control.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:52.150
Staying with somebody that treats you like
garbage is a decision, it is.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.920
Staying at a job that you hate is a decision.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.480
Staying in the body that you are not proud
of is a decision.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.830
Is it going to be easy?

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:09.410
No it’s not going to be easy to change it’s
simple, do a Google search and then use the

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:13.780
five second rule to force yourself to do that
stuff.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.540
Change comes down to five second decisions
and this is why the five second rule is important

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.430
for everybody to know.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:27.230
It’s your job to push yourself and I don’t
care if you are Dr. Martin Luther King Junior

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:33.130
or you are Michelangelo or you are Lin-Manuel
Miranda who wrote Hamilton you will struggle

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.700
with self-doubt.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.030
Everybody that you admire everybody and the
list is the same; Oprah Winfrey and I want

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:46.200
to be like Tom and I want to be like Branson
and I want to be like Jay-Z and I want like

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.920
… Everybody is listed as a Bill Gates.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:54.670
Do you know what those people do, they do
not have the habit of hesitating they trust

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:55.670
themselves.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.340
Tom: Now really fast before we go tell us
about the million dollar mornings and setting

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.340
yourself up.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.670
Mel: Yes, I have a gift.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:06.359
Here is the thing I did one thing other than
the five second rule that has changed my life,

00:44:06.359 --> 00:44:07.359
my marriage everything.

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:11.540
I do not have the phone in my bedroom.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:16.410
The phone is designed by people like your
phone you should not have your phone in your

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.010
bedroom and here is why; because what’s
on your phone is not your dreams.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.849
What’s on your phone is stuff that’s been
designed by people that studied game theory.

00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:26.380
You know why you check your email all the
time?

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.120
You know why you are constantly looking at
your phone?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.940
It’s called random rewards.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:35.859
It’s a psychological principal that explains
why we pull slot machines, because every six

00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:39.589
or seven times we get a little random reward
so we keep going back.

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:42.710
I know most emails blow but every once in
a while you get a good one that’s why you

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.490
keep looking.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:50.220
I created this course called The Million Dollar
Morning; whether you want to make a million

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.010
dollars a year or in a morning or whether
you want to wake up and feel like a million

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.010
bucks.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:45:01.270
This is the science backed strategy step by
step for how to wake up because it’s not

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:06.720
when you wake up that matters it’s how you
wake up that matters.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.460
We filmed it at the house I walk you through
all the science, I show you the whole routine

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.440
and we’re giving it to your audience for
free.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.600
Tom: Wow thank you.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.839
Mel: You are welcome, because look I want
you to use things.

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:26.240
It’s one thing to talk, talk, talk and think
it’s another thing to actually take action.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.119
The more that you can provide, that I can
provide that shows people what to do and the

00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:38.859
more tools that we can give people to get
out of their heads and into action the more

00:45:38.859 --> 00:45:41.950
the world is going to improve, the more your
life will improve.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:47.650
Tom: All right I get the feeling that this
whole time has sort of been answering this

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.330
question but I’m going to ask it anyway;
what’s the impact that you want to have

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.950
on the world?

00:45:51.950 --> 00:46:01.530
Mel: The impact that I want to have is I want
to teach people how to discover the power

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.710
that’s inside of them.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:13.880
To live fully in the open and share themselves;
who they are, who they are not like there

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.650
is so much fear that we live with.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:20.780
I want to teach people how to live with more
courage because courage is nothing more than

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.610
the ability to do things that are uncertain.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:35.800
In today’s world we have the internet you
can literally learn, launch, do anything.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:44.290
The only thing that’s truly stopping you
are the limiting patterns that you think;

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:49.599
the self-doubt, the fear, the habits that
you have and you can break them.

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:53.369
You can break them five seconds at a time.

00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:57.880
The impact that I want to have is I want to
teach people a simple way to discover the

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.420
power that’s locked inside them and then
to unleash it and go out and live the life

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.570
they’ve always dreamt of.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:08.240
Tom: Awesome Mel thank you so much for [crosstalk
00:47:07].

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.980
Mel: I want a hug get over there.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.380
Tom: Got it.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.520
Guys you are going to want to dive into the
very warm waters that are this woman’s world.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.530
It is absolutely astonishing I’m talking
raw vulnerability but what I love is no matter

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:29.150
how silly some of the things she may say they
are, they are incredibly powerful.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:33.710
You will see her community they will reach
out, you will see them talking about how they

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:38.000
have changed in real time whether it’s stepping
back of a ledge and not making a catastrophically

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.060
bad decision.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.280
Whether it’s just truly jumping out of bed
and attacking their life, unleashing the power

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.690
that they have within themselves to live the
life they were meant to live, to finally own

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:52.550
what they actually want which is something
that she really, really encourages everybody

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.230
to do especially our community.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:48:02.020
It is unbelievable and you guys will benefit
so tremendously from somebody who is able

to convey the difference between motivation
which is bullshit and action which is real.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:14.190
That is where she has made a name for herself,
she is all about action you guys.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:19.100
Heard it today she breaks things down into
the not always easy but the always simple

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:24.560
steps and if you follow those steps you will
be able to transform your life really in five

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.560
seconds or less.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.620
