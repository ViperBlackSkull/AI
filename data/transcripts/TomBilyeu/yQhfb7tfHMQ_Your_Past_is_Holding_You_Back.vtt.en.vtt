00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
I've seen a lot of incredible people stopped

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.460
By an unwillingness to let go of a past that doesn't help them, but as Lily Tomlin said

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.170
Forgiveness means giving up hope for a better past

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.859
And that's the truth isn't it. There's nothing you can do about the past

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.199
There's nothing you can do to undo it or to change. What's already been done and yet somehow

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.320
This is the area that people struggle most with in their lives the thing that is hardest for people is

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.869
To recognize the immutability of that fact, there's nothing you can do

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.390
It's done and gone forever

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.989
And there's no way to get it back and the key in your life is to

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.320
Understand that that's fine that you're going to learn from what happened that you're gonna grow and get better and that living your life in

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.259
The past is stopping you from having a future

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.219
But as Seneca noted every new beginning comes

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.500
from some other beginnings end

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.299
And if you can accept that if you can literally close the door on your past if you can accept

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.619
It's never going to get better if you can accept that it is what it is if you can accept that

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.099
Part of what makes you a beautiful human being is that horrible thing that happened to you or that horrible thing that you did that?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Thing that you think there's no way

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.510
You could ever be forgiven for

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.199
But there's no one to forgive you but you and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.590
The only thing that you need to realize in order to give yourself that forgiveness is to understand that nothing is ever going to make

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.009
It any different

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.009
But in the way that you think

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.839
You can make it better and just by reframing that by reframing

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.930
What's happened by asking yourself a very simple question?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.519
How is that bad thing that happened to actually the best thing that ever happened to you?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.850
And if you can take control of that situation and really look into it and understand that from that something has come or

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.810
something can come

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.369
That is great that makes you stronger that makes you better and that the fortitude to look at that thing to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.869
Fortitude to find in paying something beautiful

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.999
Something that makes you a better person something that allows you to help other people then

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.759
Then you really can free yourself from being bound by the past and turn into something new

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.639
Close the door on something so that you really can go somewhere

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280
new and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.429
in the discovery of that new you in the discovery of the new place that you can go in the discovery of something new and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.360
Better for yourself you realize that you're writing that future

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.630
And once you realize that you're writing your future once you realize that you can help other people write theirs once you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.069
Realize that you can take control of all that mental baggage and turn it into something positive that literally the bricks that wage you down

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.359
Can be the bricks with which you build something new, then you will go on to do something incredible?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.729
Then you will go on to help other people then you will lift other people up and be able to do something that brings

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340
Beauty to this world

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220
but first

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.709
You have to forgive

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.630
First you have to understand that you're never going to have a better past

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.810
But you can definitely have a better future

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.370
As

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.450
An evolved avi Kant said the only way to truly learn something is by doing it

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700
Yes listen to guidance

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.870
But don't wait

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.739
That is such a powerful idea and I know right now you're listening to this because you want

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.499
Motivation you want to be inspired, but my greatest

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.790
fucking fear is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.900
that you'll get

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.769
Motivated you'll get inspired and that'll just be a declining art for a few minutes after you listen to this video that ends with you

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:46.410
doing

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.910
nothing

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.069
And what I want what I really hope for and the reason that I give myself over to making these so

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.119
Completely as I know some percentage of you on the other side of this will

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.000
Ultimately be prepared to take that first step

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.119
You will realize that the only thing that matters is action

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.560
and you will take the action and it's in that action that your potential greatness waits and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.440
As Martin Luther King said take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.110
Just take the first step

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.100
You've just got to believe

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.619
That you can learn you don't have to believe that you're already capable of doing what you want

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.440
You don't have to believe that you can already build that thing that you dream

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.160
You don't have to believe that you already are extraordinary

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.619
You simply have to believe that if you take that first step you

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.820
Put yourself on a journey not of execution you put yourself on a journey of learning so that you can execute and that

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.700
When you understand that difference?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.730
That's when you really will be on that path to greatness and that is the thing that I want for everybody listening to this please

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.709
Understand the only thing you need to know is that you have to take the first step

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.079
Whatever the vision is that you have for your life

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.480
You absolutely can make it come true

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.599
And the process is very simple the process is about learning the process is about growing and getting better

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.279
It's about recognizing what you're not good at it's about recognizing what you have to learn. It's about taking that first step on faith

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.390
on

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.049
Faith that you can get better not on faith that you're great on faith that you can

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.539
Become the greatest of all time

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.100
Once you have that faith once you know that simply being a human being

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.489
Puts you in this rare category of creature that can get better through pressure through pain through

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.870
difficulty through failure

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.229
Those are the things that are going to be the building blocks of your success but in order to begin on that road in order

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.659
To have your first glorious failure you must first take that first step

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.060
So, please

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.390
Don't waste your time being motivated or inspired spend every second of your time

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.210
moving forward

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.790
That's how you're gonna get where you want to go

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.589
Greatness is the most demanding mistress you're ever going to encounter

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.260
And I understand the advice that I'm about to give you is not

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.820
For everyone most people should turn this off

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.269
But if you're gonna stick with me if you're going to listen to what I have to say it's because you want something

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.950
Tremendous in your life you want to stand out from everyone else you want to do something

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.679
More than other people think it's possible

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.530
You literally want to stand outside the norm, and if that's the case for you

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:49.359
Then understand that as Albert Einstein said only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.119
Strength and soul can be a true master for this reason

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.299
mastery demands all of a person

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.849
if you want to

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.760
get great if you really want to make a skill set your own if you want to be able to do something and at the

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.579
end of the day if you want to transform the world if you want to make grand changes if you want to do all of

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.840
That shit all the empty words that people spout all the time

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.160
Let me tell you the only thing that's going to separate you from all the other blowhards

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.929
We're just talking words, and we'll never do anything is

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.349
To give yourself over completely to let that obsession let that thing that you love

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:43.000
completely consume you and in that your only chance to really become great lies as

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:52.510
Friends Kafka said don't bend don't water down. Don't try to make it logical rather follow your most intense

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:54.590
obsessions

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.470
mercilessly

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.839
Can you do that can you become?

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.940
mercilessly obsessed

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.760
Can you let something occupy you to where all?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.390
Logic and reason is gone out the window and the only thing that matters is whether or not you accomplish

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.149
Will you hold yourself accountable to metrics?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.010
Will you look at the world and see am I actually making change?

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:24.939
Are you prepared to hold yourself to that standard because if you are there is nothing you can't fucking do if you're willing to take

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:30.070
That responsibility on to transform yourself as a human being if you give

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.130
your self over to

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.140
Getting

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.520
great

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.020
If you give yourself over to that obsession if you feed it

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:47.229
Like you would feed a beast if you feed it like you would feed a fire that can wipe out an entire

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.610
mountainside

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.440
Then you've got a chance

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.650
But it's got to burn within you like that. You've got to feed it like that. You've got to feed its skills

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.499
You've got to get better every day. You've got to constantly wake up and understand exactly

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.039
what it is you're building towards that and build towards it with a

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.840
Relentlessness that other people think is mania that other people can see only

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.499
madness in what you do and

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.919
if you can push yourself to that level

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.369
then the world will bend to your will as

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.219
Epictetus said he is a wise man who does not grieve for things which he has not

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.089
But rejoices for those which he has

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:37.240
And that's gratitude isn't it it's the very base decision that we all have to make

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:45.459
Are you grateful for the things you have in your life or are you always wanting more and trust me I get it I?

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.719
Understand people that strive for more I understand people that want something bigger and better

00:09:52.970 --> 00:10:00.790
But at the same time if you allow yourself to only think about what you don't have to only be striving for something more

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:08.349
That that obsession will begin to overtake you it will begin to corrode you but ultimately it's a choice ultimately at any time

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.810
right now in this moment you can stop and

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.180
Think about what you have you can put your attention on the things you're grateful for and watch what it does

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:24.759
watch what it does in that instance the way that it changes you the way that it changes your chemistry your feelings in a

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.600
moment

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.350
Can shift from negative and dark?

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.290
to beautiful

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.189
With nothing else changing around you nothing but you deciding

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.670
That you're gonna focus on the things you're grateful for nothing

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.409
But deciding that there are things in your life to be grateful for and that is a decision no matter

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:51.099
What is happening in your life at any moment right now in the depths of a depression in something going on?

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.519
terribly in your life you can choose right now to

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.910
Think about the things you're grateful for

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.130
the breeze a

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:06.730
smile from somebody kind a stranger who holds open a door for you anything, but it's a choice and

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.139
As Einstein said there are only two ways to live your life

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.170
One is as though. Nothing is a miracle

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:21.010
The other is as though everything is a miracle and what choice are you making?

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.769
What are you choosing to focus on right now?

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.759
do you

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:29.649
Gratitude fill you up or not and here's the critical part

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:34.689
and I want you to listen to this really well whatever you decide whether you decide we live in a

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:42.129
Of miracles or whether we decide to live in a world devoid of miracles you were choosing one thing to the exclusion

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:49.389
Of the other and when you focus on something that you're grateful for when you look at those little moments in your life and choose

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.199
to see them as grand miracles even whinny there's only a

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:59.140
Gentle hand on your shoulder even then it's only a kiss from somebody who you've kissed a thousand times before

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:06.279
Even when it is only holding the hand of somebody who needed their hand held even when it's something that simple

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.869
It really is a miracle that it really is something that can fill you it really is something that will change your chemistry

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.210
bring a connection between two people allow you to see a grander Vista or even just

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.849
open a window and look out at the world and realize that you're alive that this is all a

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.169
Miracle that none of this is guaranteed that every breath you take

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.690
could be your last and

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.100
in that

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:45.810
You can choose to cherish what you have in that you can decide to focus on

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.080
that you have a breath to take and

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:56.489
Even when it's something that simple when you train your mind to do that when you train yourself to

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.210
Decide to see the beauty in that

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.929
that nobody can ever take it away from you and

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.250
Matter where you are no matter what's going on in your life

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.750
You'll be able to rise up and feel the beauty

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.570
That is being alive

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:23.310
So take a minute at the worst times in your life and focus on the things you're grateful for

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:28.579
I

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:34.469
Wanted to spell a myth for you, it's the talent myth

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:43.229
It's the belief that some people were just born with more than others that some people are naturally gifted in some art

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.869
and that's just the way the cookie crumbles and

00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:53.399
Whatever you're gonna. Be is essentially determined by how you started that your DNA is exactly your destiny

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:57.118
I'm here to tell you right now. That's

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.238
Bullshit it's just not true

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:04.649
It's not the truth of the way that humans are designed as a species were the ultimate

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:11.069
Adaptation machine that the very thing that puts us at the top of the pyramid is our ability to adapt

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:17.339
It is the fact that the brain is plastic that it responds to change it responds to stressors it

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:20.128
responds to repetition and

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:23.938
repetition is a slave to obsession as

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.779
Conor McGregor said there's no talent here. This is hard work. This is an obsession

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:33.868
You could be anyone if you put in the time

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:39.269
That's one of the greatest athletes of our time telling you that he's not the result of

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.139
Genetics. He's not the result of natural gifts. He hasn't been bestowed something by God

00:14:46.209 --> 00:14:52.558
He has shown up day after day in the most mundane of conditions on the cold days on the hot days

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.618
He put in the work because he was obsessed with

00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:58.139
What he could become and that repetition?

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:04.109
That you need to actually gain a skill follows that obsession so in you right now right now

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:09.959
Today you want to start building that obsession you want to look at it like an ember that can become a raging fire

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:12.688
But it needs your time and attention

00:15:13.689 --> 00:15:17.729
It needs your time and attention you've got to take that

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.660
Interest you've got to take that

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.290
Spark of desire and you've got to fan the flame

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:28.770
You've got to turn it into that obsession and from that obsession if you put in the work if you do the things day in

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.439
And date out the back-breaking work pushing through the pain

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:38.130
Fighting through feeling like an idiot fighting through embarrassment getting up brushing yourself off doing it again

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.550
Practicing putting yourself at somebody's feet and asking

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.310
What could I have done better?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.680
Not look at the things you're doing well

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.729
But look at the things we're doing wrong look at the things you're doing poorly staring at your inadequacies

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400
with no loss of pride

00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:00.030
Because the only thing you value in yourself is your willingness to do that your ruling is to work your ass off

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:07.830
And as Sylvester Stallone said, I'm not the richest smartest or most talented person in the world, but I succeed

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.539
because I keep going and going and going and

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.109
That's the secret there's nothing more than that

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.129
The people that you see that win at the highest level they were the ones that didn't give up

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.160
They're the survivors and you've got to ask yourself am I a survivor type am I the type of person that?

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.670
continues to push through

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:34.060
When it gets hard when it gets boring when I feel lost when I don't know what I'm doing when I have no faith in

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.829
Myself even in that darkest hour can I push?

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:45.550
Forward can I accept that the human body will respond to that stress it will respond to that stimulus

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.240
But I have to show up and I have to do the work

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:53.949
And so that's the beautiful thing you're not gonna separate yourself based on your genetics

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.799
You're not gonna separate yourself based on who your parents were where you were born

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:05.890
You're gonna separate yourself by showing up when you don't want to you're gonna separate yourself by pushing forward when it hurts

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:09.399
You're gonna separate yourself by always

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.259
Moving forward even when the forward is falling on your face

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.660
So never lose sight of that. It's the person that keeps going that can't be defeated

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.019
Here's the hard truth about getting great

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.150
It takes time and dedication

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.209
It takes a willingness to accept that you're not yet. Good enough it takes the ability

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:43.960
To stare at the places that you know that you're weak to really look at those things and not let it affect

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:50.380
Your sense of self-esteem and not let it affect your sense of self-worth so that you can still get the momentum going

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.869
But you have to understand that in the beginning

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.719
We're all terrible and as henri cartier-bresson said your first

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:05.379
10,000 photographs are your worst and so the thing that really makes great art are the people that

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:11.620
Continue to push and the people that continue to work and face how inadequate they are and really

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:15.009
Understand that at the end of the day greatness is a craft

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.620
Greatness is a process

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:22.209
Greatness is a habit greatness is the little things that you do every

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.069
over time going out everyday

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:31.729
Unafraid of whether or not this is one of the 10,000 terrible things that you're going to do

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.329
It's being unafraid to make those mistakes as being unafraid

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.090
That you're not yet great

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.520
And as Marianne rad maker said courage doesn't always war

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:50.479
Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying I will try again tomorrow

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:56.750
And that's it if you want to be great. That's what you have to do you've got to get up again tomorrow

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.819
You've got to be willing to face another day

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.160
You've got to be willing to accept that you've got to get through the bad ideas before you can get to the good

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.589
You've got to understand that you have to start as an apprentice

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.169
You have to start as a person going and getting tea

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:15.050
And you have to accept that that's the job that you should be playing that you should be working for somebody else you should be

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.190
Looking up to somebody else's seeing what they can teach you because what you know?

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.140
Is that you're there to learn what you know is that you're there to get through the?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:32.419
10,000 bad photographs that you need to get through to ultimately achieve greatness, and if you make the catastrophic error, that's so

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.300
many make

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.880
To try to tell them whether you're extraordinary

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.320
To try to get the world to follow you and look up to you and think here something today

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.040
Because the people that living win the ones that

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:54.290
Today the ones that listen today the ones that spend every ounce of their energy

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.430
Amassing mastery getting better every day

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.490
working their asses off to improve their skill set to

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.519
relentlessly look at the things that they're not doing well to

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:10.639
Understand that they have to break themselves down and get rid of all of their ego before they can really find greatness

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.120
Those are the people that we remember

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.820
So if you want to be remembered if you want to achieve real greatness

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.530
you just need to have the courage to show up every day and

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.940
Take another swing

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.860
Take another photo

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:35.000
Try another task do something that scares you and do those little things over and over

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.330
and over until you win as

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:44.030
Kurt Vonnegut one of the greatest authors in modern time said

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.609
When I write I feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.580
but he still did it and

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:57.829
That's the kind of thing that you're gonna hear from the Great's you're not gonna hear that it was easy you're not gonna hear that

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:04.789
They felt suave and cool even the greatest of all time have that awkwardness not clumsiness

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:11.029
They're never quite as good as they want to be but what I want you to understand is even though Kurt Vonnegut said those words

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.200
He wrote

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.200
tons of books that

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.039
changed people's lives that changed the landscape of

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.509
Literature because despite the fact that he felt awkward and clumsy

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:30.859
He kept doing it and doing it and forcing himself to move forward to take one step after another even when the process

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:38.479
Was not exactly rewarding he believed in something. He knew that what he was trying to do would ultimately

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:46.550
Get better he knew that if he wanted to accomplish something great that he had to push through the awkwardness and that

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.140
Is the very trick to getting great?

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.039
You just have to do it you have to go you have to take that first step

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.319
You have to push you have to drive you have to strive

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:03.090
every time to get a little bit better you have to strive not to fall prey to your own doubts and insecurities and

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.720
As Joan Amos said

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:09.989
If you aren't going all the way why go at all?

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:15.510
But it's doing that in face of the fear. It's doing that in face of the difficulties

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:21.239
It isn't only because someone is great that they say you should either do it all the way to play hard or go home

00:22:21.429 --> 00:22:24.749
They're not saying it because the process is in and of itself rewarding

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.500
They're saying it because there is something that they're trying to accomplish that demands it

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:35.189
But they're prepared to play on a world stage and once you know why you're doing what you're doing once something sits at the core

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:40.049
Of your being and despite how difficult painful awkward it may be to push forward

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.559
you push forward no matter what the odds and

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.230
as Hannibal said one of the greatest military leaders of all time I

00:22:52.899 --> 00:22:59.638
Wider find a way, or I'll make one and he said that as he was getting elephants across the Alps

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:06.029
Now when you think of the difficulties that you face in trying to do what you're trying to accomplish think about that man

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:12.839
Amassing an army and getting elephants to climb a mountain and saying not this is impossible

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.079
But rather if there's not already a way present

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.480
I will make one and when you can look at that when you can look at your own inadequacies when you can accept

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.000
But you were not yet good enough, but you know then you'll put in the work to get there

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.819
You know the allure the things you need to learn that you will push and you will practice and you will shape yourself

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:39.178
Into someone capable of doing it and if you have to literally carve your own path out of these stone

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.969
granite of a mountainside you will do that because that's what your goals demand and

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:53.280
When you're prepared to do what ever your goals demand you will accomplish whatever you set your mind to

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.600
As Albert Einstein said try not to become a man of success

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.959
But rather try to become a man of value

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.629
This is something that I think about a lot at the end of the day success is incredibly

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:17.069
Motivating in accomplishing your goals and your dreams is something that I wanted to do since I was a little kid

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.070
That's been a driving force in my life

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:24.959
but through all of that the times that I've felt happiest the times that I felt most secure the times that my

00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:27.359
anxiety and my stress have been at zero

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.120
Are the times where I felt like I was being

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:36.750
Most true to myself where I was trying to really become a person of substance. I wasn't looking for something extrinsic

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:42.119
I was focused inward and trying to develop the person that I'm becoming that I had some

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.609
Code that I was living by that. I was really

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.919
Deciding not just what outwardly success looks like but what does it mean to be a good person?

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:51.720
What does it mean to be an effective person?

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.280
What does it mean to be worthy of trust and those things at the end of the day?

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:02.669
Those things are something that when you invest in finding value in that that it takes you somewhere

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.060
Amazing and as Bruce Lee said knowledge will give you power

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:13.089
But character will give you respect and at the end of the day. I really can't think of anything better than that

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.090
I can't think of anything that will

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.329
Keep me company when I'm alone when there's nothing but silence around

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:25.690
When all I can hear the sounds of my own thoughts the only thing that is going to bring me or you comfort is

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:33.129
Respect this self-love is knowing who you are really and knowing that you're true to that even when nobody's looking and that

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:39.160
Concept that notion of having a guiding light of principle something by which you steer by that you are always

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:44.349
true to and then in your moments of stress chaos confusion of

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.060
Desire that in your moments of deepest desire

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.910
That you're still true to that

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.650
That all you think about is that Norstar of being that person that you want to be

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.689
When you let that be your guiding light when you stay true to that

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.840
nothing can hurt you

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.109
Because nothing will be able to make you feel badly about yourself

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.170
Because once you know who you are and you're true to it nothing else matters

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.770
As

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.770
Walt Disney said

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.920
If you can dream it you can do it

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.749
Now what makes me laugh is I know right now some of the people listening to that

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:50.240
They say that's bullshit. They're just limits to what humans can do and

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.429
I get that response I understand it. I used to respond to everything like that

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.590
I used to see only the difficulty I used to see only the ways in which it couldn't work out

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:04.249
And I couldn't see I was literally blinded by fear

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:09.560
I was blinded by some bizarre sense of pride that wanted to justify my limited existence

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:15.769
That didn't want to have to face that I could be doing more that I couldn't be more that my life was somehow less

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.530
than what it could be and

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.779
So I would laugh at quotes like that and I know right now of the chills I know right now

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:29.869
There are people that are laughing at that and all they can think about are the limits all they can think about are the things

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.580
That prove him wrong and guess what he is wrong there really are limits

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.019
But if you fucking waste your time focused on that you're never

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:45.050
Going to create the momentum that you need to actually make something come true in your life. You can build

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:52.040
virtually anything, but if you get hung up on the fucking virtual part if you let that stop you if you

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.710
Immediately go to the things that ultimately limit you and hold you back that is where you're gonna stay

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:04.190
forever because if you argue for your limitations guess what my friend they become yours and

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.749
Congratulations. You now get to live in that box you get to live in that

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.580
self-defined prison

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.710
but if like Teddy Roosevelt said

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:18.949
Instead of that you keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground and you don't act like somebody who can't see

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.489
That sure there are limits. There are edges to this universe

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.509
But you're looking at that

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.559
You're looking at how he really executes. You're

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.009
Dreaming big and you're remembering that your feet

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:40.150
ultimately is that contact point it is where the rubber meets the road it is that moment of doing and

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.090
so if instead of

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.059
Rejecting it because your feet must stay planted on the ground

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:52.270
Remember that in keeping your feet on the ground. That's the moment of action. That's the moment of doing something about it

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.629
that's the moment of seeing the fucking possibilities and then

00:28:56.179 --> 00:28:58.179
moving

00:28:58.309 --> 00:29:01.479
Doing something making it real so right now

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:08.110
Give up on those weird mental mechanisms that make you actually want to fight for the things

00:29:08.419 --> 00:29:12.729
That aren't possible to get people to believe in it to get people to understand why

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.850
You've chosen to stand still

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:23.949
Instead of that convince yourself that you should be moving and don't do what you know you're destined to do

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.760
as

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.760
Haroon 'yeah noted I

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:36.280
always wonder why birds stay in the same place when they can fly anywhere on earth, and then I ask myself the same question as

00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:43.149
Mark twain put it the secret of getting ahead is getting started, and that's where people get stuck

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.650
You're literally like the bird. You could fly anywhere you want you can go

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.630
Anywhere you want to go and look

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:54.520
I know you've got a litany of excuses and all of them are valid you've got a job

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.439
You can't just leave well. You don't have a job, and you don't have the money your family is in one place

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.470
It's the only thing that you've ever known. You only speak one language

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:08.140
You've never traveled before you don't have a passport you can't afford the gas money. There are a thousand

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.309
real

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:12.309
Reasons not to go

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.380
But the truth is that none of them matter the truth is if you want to build something in your life that you have to

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:22.420
Remember Mark Twain said you have to get started because at the end of the day that is

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:30.219
Literally the only thing that's holding you back you're not moving and once you get the simplicity of that once you understand

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:36.729
That you could act right now. You could say fuck all the excuses you can stop making them

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.740
You could stop giving in to them no matter how?

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:46.539
Valid they are no matter how real they may seem you can finally decide that you're going to get up immunity

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:52.690
You're gonna create that momentum that you're going to take a step that you're gonna make the demand that you create momentum that you get

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.480
Something done, but you fucking find an answer

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:02.199
or as Hannibal said that you're going to find a way or make one if you have to carve through fucking rock do it because

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200
humans before you

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.890
Have done it

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:11.259
And that's the simple truth that is the simple fucking truth and everything else is bullshit

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:19.719
Everything else is the weak voice in your mind holding you back and making you a less version of yourself, so I ask you

00:31:20.929 --> 00:31:23.559
Why doesn't the bird fly wherever it wants to go?

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.100
Because that's all it's known

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.350
Because that's what's safe

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.489
Because that's what's comfortable well because it's a dumb fucking animal

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.500
What do you want to be if this isn't the life you want to live?

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.380
Do something about it?

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.940
You
