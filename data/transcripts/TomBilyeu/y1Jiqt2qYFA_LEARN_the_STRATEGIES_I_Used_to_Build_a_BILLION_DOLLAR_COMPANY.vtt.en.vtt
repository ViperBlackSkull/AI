dig this
 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.390 align:start position:0%

then<00:03:19.360><c> we're</c><00:03:19.519><c> going</c><00:03:19.599><c> to</c><00:03:19.680><c> go</c><00:03:19.760><c> down</c><00:03:20.000><c> the</c><00:03:20.080><c> process</c>

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go down the process
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.030 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go down the process
of<00:03:20.560><c> gaining</c><00:03:21.200><c> mastery</c><00:03:22.080><c> only</c><00:03:22.400><c> in</c><00:03:22.560><c> the</c><00:03:22.640><c> process</c>

but because it was a startup they just
 

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.509 align:start position:0%
but because it was a startup they just

there's never like well how about this
 

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.590 align:start position:0%
there's never like well how about this
we<00:24:00.159><c> were</c><00:24:00.320><c> never</c><00:24:00.559><c> in</c><00:24:00.640><c> a</c><00:24:00.799><c> situation</c><00:24:01.279><c> where</c><00:24:01.440><c> we</c>

we were never in a situation where we

were in a three-way deadlock
 

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.430 align:start position:0%
were in a three-way deadlock
so<00:24:03.679><c> it</c><00:24:03.760><c> was</c><00:24:03.919><c> just</c><00:24:04.240><c> far</c><00:24:04.480><c> too</c><00:24:04.640><c> easy</c><00:24:04.880><c> one</c><00:24:05.120><c> person</c>

but<00:32:24.720><c> i</c><00:32:24.880><c> definitely</c><00:32:25.200><c> created</c><00:32:25.600><c> a</c><00:32:25.760><c> macro</c><00:32:26.240><c> culture</c>

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
but i definitely created a macro culture
 

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.669 align:start position:0%
but i definitely created a macro culture

of entitlement
 

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.509 align:start position:0%

because<00:32:27.919><c> i</c><00:32:28.080><c> had</c><00:32:28.240><c> people</c><00:32:28.559><c> over</c><00:32:28.799><c> everything</c><00:32:29.440><c> and</c>

00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
because i had people over everything and
 

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
because i had people over everything and
