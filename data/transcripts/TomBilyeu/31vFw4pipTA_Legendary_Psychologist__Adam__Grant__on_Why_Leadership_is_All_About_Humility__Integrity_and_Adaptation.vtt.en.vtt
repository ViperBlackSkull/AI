skills
all<00:04:01.280><c> right</c><00:04:01.519><c> so</c><00:04:01.840><c> before</c><00:04:02.159><c> we</c><00:04:02.560><c> go</c><00:04:02.799><c> on</c><00:04:02.879><c> to</c><00:04:03.040><c> skills</c>

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
all right so before we go on to skills
 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.710 align:start position:0%
all right so before we go on to skills
let's<00:04:03.599><c> talk</c><00:04:03.760><c> about</c><00:04:03.920><c> those</c><00:04:04.239><c> in</c><00:04:04.319><c> a</c><00:04:04.400><c> little</c><00:04:04.560><c> more</c>

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
let's talk about those in a little more
 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.149 align:start position:0%
let's talk about those in a little more
depth<00:04:04.959><c> so</c><00:04:05.200><c> one</c><00:04:05.360><c> of</c><00:04:05.439><c> the</c><00:04:05.519><c> things</c><00:04:05.760><c> i</c><00:04:05.840><c> found</c>

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
depth so one of the things i found
 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
depth so one of the things i found
interesting<00:04:06.640><c> in</c><00:04:06.720><c> the</c><00:04:06.799><c> book</c>

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
interesting in the book
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.550 align:start position:0%
interesting in the book
is<00:04:08.640><c> when</c><00:04:08.879><c> you're</c><00:04:09.040><c> talking</c><00:04:09.360><c> about</c><00:04:10.000><c> takers</c>

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
is when you're talking about takers
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.710 align:start position:0%
is when you're talking about takers
givers<00:04:11.120><c> matchers</c><00:04:11.599><c> that</c><00:04:11.760><c> you</c><00:04:11.920><c> said</c><00:04:12.560><c> the</c>

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
givers matchers that you said the
 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
givers matchers that you said the
interesting<00:04:13.200><c> thing</c><00:04:13.439><c> about</c><00:04:13.840><c> givers</c><00:04:14.239><c> is</c><00:04:14.319><c> that</c>

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about givers is that
 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.069 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about givers is that
they<00:04:14.640><c> represent</c><00:04:15.040><c> both</c><00:04:15.280><c> ends</c><00:04:15.439><c> of</c><00:04:15.519><c> the</c><00:04:15.680><c> spectrum</c>

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
they represent both ends of the spectrum
 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.069 align:start position:0%
they represent both ends of the spectrum
so<00:04:16.320><c> you</c><00:04:16.479><c> see</c><00:04:16.720><c> some</c><00:04:16.880><c> of</c><00:04:17.040><c> the</c><00:04:17.280><c> least</c><00:04:17.519><c> successful</c>

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
so you see some of the least successful
 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.749 align:start position:0%
so you see some of the least successful
people<00:04:18.400><c> are</c><00:04:18.560><c> givers</c><00:04:18.959><c> and</c><00:04:19.120><c> then</c><00:04:19.359><c> the</c><00:04:19.519><c> most</c>

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
people are givers and then the most
 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.909 align:start position:0%
people are givers and then the most
successful<00:04:20.320><c> people</c><00:04:20.560><c> are</c><00:04:20.720><c> givers</c><00:04:21.600><c> and</c><00:04:21.680><c> so</c><00:04:21.840><c> i'd</c>

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
successful people are givers and so i'd
 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
successful people are givers and so i'd
love<00:04:22.079><c> to</c><00:04:22.240><c> know</c><00:04:22.639><c> how</c><00:04:22.800><c> to</c><00:04:22.960><c> use</c><00:04:23.199><c> it</c><00:04:23.440><c> functionally</c>

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
love to know how to use it functionally
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.990 align:start position:0%
love to know how to use it functionally
and<00:04:24.240><c> when</c><00:04:24.479><c> it</c><00:04:24.639><c> sort</c><00:04:24.800><c> of</c><00:04:24.880><c> metastasizes</c><00:04:25.919><c> and</c>

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
and when it sort of metastasizes and
 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.510 align:start position:0%
and when it sort of metastasizes and
becomes<00:04:26.320><c> a</c><00:04:26.400><c> problem</c>

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem
yeah<00:04:27.759><c> so</c><00:04:27.919><c> if</c><00:04:28.000><c> you</c><00:04:28.080><c> look</c><00:04:28.240><c> at</c><00:04:28.320><c> the</c><00:04:28.479><c> differences</c>

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you look at the differences
 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.870 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you look at the differences
between<00:04:29.280><c> failed</c><00:04:29.520><c> and</c><00:04:29.600><c> successful</c><00:04:30.160><c> givers</c>

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
between failed and successful givers
 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.749 align:start position:0%
between failed and successful givers
they<00:04:31.199><c> break</c><00:04:31.440><c> down</c><00:04:31.680><c> into</c><00:04:31.840><c> the</c><00:04:32.000><c> question</c><00:04:32.320><c> of</c>

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
they break down into the question of
 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.990 align:start position:0%
they break down into the question of
actually<00:04:34.000><c> it's</c><00:04:34.160><c> three</c><00:04:34.479><c> questions</c><00:04:35.040><c> one</c><00:04:35.759><c> who</c><00:04:35.919><c> do</c>

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i think to me it's it's so much
 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.629 align:start position:0%
and i think to me it's it's so much
better<00:14:14.639><c> to</c><00:14:14.800><c> be</c><00:14:14.959><c> on</c><00:14:15.120><c> an</c><00:14:15.279><c> upward</c><00:14:15.519><c> trajectory</c>

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
better to be on an upward trajectory
 

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
better to be on an upward trajectory
than<00:14:16.800><c> it</c><00:14:17.040><c> is</c><00:14:17.199><c> to</c><00:14:17.519><c> you</c><00:14:17.680><c> know</c><00:14:17.839><c> to</c><00:14:18.000><c> flatline</c><00:14:18.639><c> at</c>

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
than it is to you know to flatline at
 

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.750 align:start position:0%
than it is to you know to flatline at
some<00:14:19.040><c> level</c><00:14:19.519><c> uh</c><00:14:19.760><c> or</c><00:14:19.920><c> to</c><00:14:20.079><c> stagnate</c><00:14:20.639><c> and</c><00:14:20.800><c> so</c>

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
some level uh or to stagnate and so
 

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.509 align:start position:0%
some level uh or to stagnate and so
i<00:14:22.000><c> i</c><00:14:22.160><c> think</c><00:14:22.320><c> that</c><00:14:22.480><c> that</c><00:14:22.720><c> requires</c><00:14:23.120><c> short-term</c>

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%

the water was completely different in
 

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.230 align:start position:0%
the water was completely different in

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
see
 

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.350 align:start position:0%

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
blind spots which are weaknesses that we
 

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.430 align:start position:0%

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
to do is
 

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.590 align:start position:0%
to do is
make<00:26:32.080><c> sure</c><00:26:32.320><c> that</c><00:26:32.640><c> core</c><00:26:32.960><c> values</c><00:26:33.279><c> that</c><00:26:33.440><c> are</c>

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't like i think that you have to
 

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:41.669 align:start position:0%
doesn't like i think that you have to
filter<00:26:40.080><c> to</c><00:26:40.240><c> a</c><00:26:40.320><c> large</c><00:26:40.640><c> extent</c><00:26:41.120><c> and</c><00:26:41.279><c> so</c><00:26:41.520><c> the</c>

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
filter to a large extent and so the
 

00:26:41.679 --> 00:26:42.870 align:start position:0%
filter to a large extent and so the
question<00:26:41.919><c> is</c><00:26:42.000><c> what</c><00:26:42.159><c> do</c><00:26:42.240><c> you</c><00:26:42.320><c> filter</c><00:26:42.559><c> for</c><00:26:42.720><c> and</c><00:26:42.799><c> i</c>

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
question is what do you filter for and i
 

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
question is what do you filter for and i
think<00:26:43.039><c> most</c><00:26:43.200><c> people</c><00:26:43.440><c> filter</c><00:26:43.760><c> for</c><00:26:43.919><c> skill</c><00:26:44.240><c> set</c>

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
think most people filter for skill set
 

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
think most people filter for skill set
it's<00:26:44.799><c> very</c><00:26:44.960><c> easy</c><00:26:45.200><c> to</c><00:26:45.279><c> put</c><00:26:45.520><c> on</c><00:26:45.600><c> a</c><00:26:45.679><c> resume</c>
