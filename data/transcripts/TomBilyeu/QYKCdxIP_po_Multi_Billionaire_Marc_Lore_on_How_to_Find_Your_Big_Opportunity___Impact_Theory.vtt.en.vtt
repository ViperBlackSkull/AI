i<00:20:37.679><c> think</c><00:20:38.080><c> you</c><00:20:38.240><c> can</c><00:20:38.480><c> definitely</c><00:20:39.039><c> be</c><00:20:39.360><c> better</c><00:20:39.840><c> at</c>

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think you can definitely be better at
 

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.789 align:start position:0%
i think you can definitely be better at
it<00:20:40.559><c> but</c><00:20:40.799><c> i</c><00:20:40.880><c> do</c><00:20:41.120><c> think</c><00:20:41.280><c> there's</c><00:20:41.600><c> something</c>
