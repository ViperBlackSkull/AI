00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
faster sprint even farther but it's just
 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
faster sprint even farther but it's just

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
finding that balance that's really
 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.270 align:start position:0%
finding that balance that's really
effective<00:03:44.080><c> for</c><00:03:44.239><c> me</c><00:03:44.400><c> to</c><00:03:44.560><c> get</c><00:03:44.799><c> what</c><00:03:44.959><c> i</c><00:03:45.040><c> need</c><00:03:45.200><c> to</c>

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
effective for me to get what i need to
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.670 align:start position:0%

get<00:03:45.440><c> done</c><00:03:46.080><c> and</c><00:03:46.239><c> how</c><00:03:46.560><c> do</c><00:03:46.720><c> you</c><00:03:46.959><c> find</c><00:03:47.200><c> that</c><00:03:47.440><c> like</c>

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
get done and how do you find that like
 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
get done and how do you find that like
is<00:03:47.840><c> there</c>

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
is there
 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
is there
an<00:03:49.040><c> internal</c><00:03:49.840><c> uh</c><00:03:50.319><c> self-awareness</c><00:03:50.959><c> that</c>

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
an internal uh self-awareness that
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.030 align:start position:0%
an internal uh self-awareness that
you've<00:03:51.280><c> cultivated</c><00:03:52.000><c> or</c>

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
you've cultivated or
 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
you've cultivated or
yeah<00:03:53.280><c> there's</c><00:03:53.519><c> like</c><00:03:53.760><c> a</c><00:03:54.000><c> natural</c><00:03:54.720><c> sense</c><00:03:55.439><c> to</c>

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah there's like a natural sense to
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.429 align:start position:0%
yeah there's like a natural sense to
find<00:03:56.080><c> balance</c><00:03:56.560><c> and</c><00:03:56.640><c> i</c><00:03:56.720><c> think</c><00:03:56.879><c> we</c><00:03:57.040><c> all</c><00:03:57.200><c> have</c>

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
find balance and i think we all have
 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
find balance and i think we all have
