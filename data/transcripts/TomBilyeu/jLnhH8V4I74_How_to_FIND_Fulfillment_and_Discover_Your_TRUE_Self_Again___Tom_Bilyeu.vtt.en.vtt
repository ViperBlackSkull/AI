00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
formula so first of all it's very
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
formula so first of all it's very

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
important to understand that growing up
 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.190 align:start position:0%
important to understand that growing up
on<00:01:33.119><c> the</c><00:01:33.200><c> plains</c><00:01:33.680><c> of</c><00:01:33.920><c> the</c><00:01:34.079><c> savannah</c><00:01:34.880><c> you</c><00:01:35.119><c> would</c>

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
on the plains of the savannah you would
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
on the plains of the savannah you would
have<00:01:35.280><c> had</c><00:01:35.520><c> to</c><00:01:35.680><c> work</c><00:01:36.000><c> really</c><00:01:36.240><c> hard</c><00:01:36.640><c> to</c><00:01:36.880><c> stay</c>

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
have had to work really hard to stay
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
have had to work really hard to stay
alive<00:01:37.920><c> to</c><00:01:38.079><c> feed</c><00:01:38.240><c> your</c><00:01:38.400><c> family</c><00:01:38.960><c> so</c><00:01:39.200><c> you</c><00:01:39.360><c> had</c><00:01:39.439><c> to</c>

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
alive to feed your family so you had to
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
alive to feed your family so you had to
face<00:01:39.920><c> tremendous</c><00:01:40.560><c> danger</c><00:01:41.040><c> massive</c><00:01:41.439><c> obstacles</c>

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
face tremendous danger massive obstacles
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.230 align:start position:0%
face tremendous danger massive obstacles
and<00:01:42.479><c> so</c><00:01:43.040><c> nature</c><00:01:43.520><c> only</c><00:01:43.759><c> has</c><00:01:44.399><c> two</c><00:01:45.119><c> ways</c><00:01:45.600><c> to</c><00:01:46.000><c> get</c>

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
and so nature only has two ways to get
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.030 align:start position:0%
and so nature only has two ways to get
you<00:01:46.560><c> moving</c><00:01:46.880><c> and</c><00:01:47.040><c> that</c><00:01:47.280><c> is</c><00:01:47.759><c> pleasure</c><00:01:48.240><c> and</c><00:01:48.399><c> pain</c>

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
you moving and that is pleasure and pain
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.429 align:start position:0%
you moving and that is pleasure and pain
punishment<00:01:49.600><c> reward</c><00:01:50.399><c> so</c><00:01:50.720><c> when</c><00:01:50.880><c> it</c><00:01:51.040><c> wants</c>

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
punishment reward so when it wants
 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.270 align:start position:0%
punishment reward so when it wants
behavior<00:01:52.000><c> it's</c><00:01:52.159><c> going</c><00:01:52.320><c> to</c><00:01:52.479><c> reward</c><00:01:52.880><c> that</c><00:01:53.119><c> by</c>

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
behavior it's going to reward that by
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.149 align:start position:0%
behavior it's going to reward that by
making<00:01:53.600><c> it</c><00:01:54.079><c> uh</c><00:01:54.560><c> feel</c><00:01:54.960><c> amazing</c><00:01:55.759><c> and</c><00:01:55.920><c> if</c><00:01:56.079><c> it</c>

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
making it uh feel amazing and if it

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't want behavior then it's going to
 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't want behavior then it's going to
make<00:01:58.640><c> sure</c><00:01:58.960><c> that</c><00:01:59.200><c> if</c><00:01:59.360><c> you're</c><00:01:59.680><c> engaging</c><00:02:00.159><c> in</c><00:02:00.240><c> it</c>

make sure that if you're engaging in it
 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.550 align:start position:0%
make sure that if you're engaging in it
it<00:02:00.560><c> sucks</c><00:02:01.200><c> and</c><00:02:01.520><c> if</c><00:02:01.759><c> it</c><00:02:01.920><c> wants</c><00:02:02.159><c> you</c><00:02:02.240><c> to</c><00:02:02.399><c> do</c>

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
it sucks and if it wants you to do
 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
it sucks and if it wants you to do
something<00:02:02.880><c> and</c><00:02:02.960><c> you</c><00:02:03.119><c> don't</c><00:02:03.360><c> do</c><00:02:03.520><c> it</c><00:02:03.680><c> that</c><00:02:03.920><c> will</c>

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
something and you don't do it that will
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
something and you don't do it that will
also<00:02:04.479><c> suck</c><00:02:05.119><c> so</c><00:02:05.520><c> this</c><00:02:05.759><c> is</c><00:02:05.920><c> where</c>

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
also suck so this is where
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.469 align:start position:0%
also suck so this is where
pleasure<00:02:07.200><c> and</c><00:02:07.360><c> pain</c><00:02:07.600><c> come</c><00:02:07.759><c> in</c><00:02:08.000><c> and</c><00:02:08.160><c> where</c><00:02:08.319><c> you</c>

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
pleasure and pain come in and where you
 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.309 align:start position:0%
pleasure and pain come in and where you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
have to really understand
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.190 align:start position:0%
have to really understand
why

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
why
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
why
this<00:02:11.520><c> cycle</c><00:02:12.319><c> is</c><00:02:12.640><c> so</c><00:02:13.120><c> deeply</c><00:02:13.680><c> embedded</c><00:02:14.319><c> in</c><00:02:14.480><c> your</c>

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
this cycle is so deeply embedded in your
 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
this cycle is so deeply embedded in your

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
brain
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.229 align:start position:0%
brain
so

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.790 align:start position:0%
so
because<00:02:17.120><c> from</c><00:02:17.280><c> an</c><00:02:17.440><c> evolutionary</c><00:02:18.080><c> standpoint</c>

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
because from an evolutionary standpoint
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
because from an evolutionary standpoint
working<00:02:19.200><c> hard</c><00:02:19.680><c> was</c><00:02:19.920><c> necessary</c><00:02:20.640><c> for</c><00:02:20.879><c> survival</c>

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
working hard was necessary for survival
 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
working hard was necessary for survival
then<00:02:21.840><c> working</c><00:02:22.160><c> hard</c><00:02:22.879><c> working</c><00:02:23.280><c> hard</c><00:02:23.680><c> has</c><00:02:23.920><c> to</c>

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
then working hard working hard has to
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.390 align:start position:0%
then working hard working hard has to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
working hard then you're going to feel a

the set of skills is really about

the set of skills is really about

serving the group
 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.710 align:start position:0%
serving the group
so

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.750 align:start position:0%
so
we<00:03:26.959><c> know</c><00:03:27.519><c> that</c><00:03:27.840><c> humans</c><00:03:28.319><c> are</c><00:03:28.720><c> a</c><00:03:28.959><c> creature</c><00:03:29.519><c> that</c>

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
we know that humans are a creature that
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.030 align:start position:0%
we know that humans are a creature that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.789 align:start position:0%
leverages culture so so many other
animals<00:03:33.680><c> are</c>

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
animals are
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start position:0%
animals are

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:start position:0%

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
are different than that so we take this
 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.270 align:start position:0%
are different than that so we take this
