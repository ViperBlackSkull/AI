well if i just accomplish this this is
 

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.190 align:start position:0%
well if i just accomplish this this is

um<00:23:26.559><c> sometimes</c><00:23:27.039><c> it's</c><00:23:27.200><c> an</c><00:23:27.360><c> endless</c><00:23:27.679><c> cycle</c><00:23:28.240><c> in</c><00:23:28.400><c> a</c>

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's an endless cycle in a
 

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.549 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's an endless cycle in a

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
negative way for some people
 

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.990 align:start position:0%
negative way for some people
because<00:23:30.799><c> they</c><00:23:30.960><c> think</c><00:23:31.200><c> once</c><00:23:31.440><c> they</c><00:23:31.600><c> accomplish</c>

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
because they think once they accomplish
 

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
because they think once they accomplish
those<00:23:32.240><c> things</c><00:23:32.400><c> they'll</c><00:23:32.640><c> be</c><00:23:32.720><c> happy</c><00:23:33.520><c> and</c><00:23:33.600><c> then</c>

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
those things they'll be happy and then
 

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.149 align:start position:0%
those things they'll be happy and then
sometimes<00:23:34.240><c> it's</c><00:23:34.480><c> a</c><00:23:34.960><c> positive</c><00:23:35.520><c> cycle</c><00:23:35.919><c> for</c>

00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a positive cycle for
 

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:37.909 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a positive cycle for
people<00:23:36.400><c> because</c><00:23:36.720><c> it's</c><00:23:36.960><c> just</c><00:23:37.600><c> about</c>

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%

um deep-rooted thing that's below that
 

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.830 align:start position:0%
um deep-rooted thing that's below that
and<00:25:04.080><c> just</c><00:25:04.240><c> kind</c><00:25:04.400><c> of</c><00:25:04.960><c> discovering</c><00:25:05.520><c> what</c><00:25:05.600><c> that</c>

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and just kind of discovering what that
 

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.310 align:start position:0%
and just kind of discovering what that
is<00:25:06.559><c> and</c><00:25:06.799><c> then</c><00:25:07.200><c> um</c>

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
is and then um
 

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
is and then um
yeah<00:25:08.559><c> i</c><00:25:08.640><c> mean</c><00:25:08.960><c> it's</c><00:25:09.200><c> it</c><00:25:09.440><c> varies</c><00:25:09.760><c> for</c><00:25:09.919><c> different</c>

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it's it varies for different
 

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it's it varies for different
characters<00:25:11.039><c> so</c><00:25:11.200><c> sometimes</c><00:25:11.600><c> it's</c><00:25:11.760><c> something</c>

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
characters so sometimes it's something
 

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.590 align:start position:0%
characters so sometimes it's something
that's<00:25:12.320><c> inside</c><00:25:12.559><c> of</c><00:25:12.640><c> me</c><00:25:12.799><c> that</c><00:25:12.960><c> i</c><00:25:13.120><c> completely</c>

wanted outside of my mother and sisters
 

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.470 align:start position:0%
wanted outside of my mother and sisters
and<00:28:52.720><c> that</c><00:28:52.880><c> was</c><00:28:53.039><c> enough</c><00:28:53.279><c> for</c><00:28:53.440><c> me</c><00:28:53.840><c> but</c><00:28:54.080><c> in</c><00:28:54.159><c> terms</c>

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that was enough for me but in terms
 

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
and that was enough for me but in terms
of<00:28:54.559><c> relationships</c><00:28:55.760><c> i</c><00:28:55.840><c> had</c><00:28:56.000><c> resigned</c><00:28:56.480><c> myself</c>

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
of relationships i had resigned myself
to<00:28:57.520><c> this</c><00:28:57.679><c> is</c><00:28:57.840><c> a</c><00:28:57.919><c> very</c><00:28:58.159><c> conditional</c><00:28:58.720><c> thing</c>

00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
to this is a very conditional thing
 

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
to this is a very conditional thing
so<00:28:59.760><c> if</c><00:28:59.919><c> it</c><00:29:00.000><c> works</c><00:29:00.240><c> for</c><00:29:00.399><c> me</c><00:29:00.559><c> i'll</c><00:29:00.720><c> do</c><00:29:00.880><c> it</c><00:29:01.039><c> if</c><00:29:01.120><c> it</c>

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
so if it works for me i'll do it if it
 

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.470 align:start position:0%
so if it works for me i'll do it if it

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't i won't
