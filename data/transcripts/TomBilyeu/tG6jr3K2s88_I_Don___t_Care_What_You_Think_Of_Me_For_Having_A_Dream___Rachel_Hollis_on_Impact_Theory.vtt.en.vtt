00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.750 align:start position:0%
so for me
this<00:13:36.000><c> is</c><00:13:36.399><c> a</c><00:13:36.560><c> very</c><00:13:36.880><c> dramatic</c><00:13:37.360><c> thing</c><00:13:37.519><c> but</c><00:13:37.680><c> i</c>

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is a very dramatic thing but i
 

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.829 align:start position:0%
this is a very dramatic thing but i
