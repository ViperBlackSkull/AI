I<00:15:49.820><c> was</c><00:15:50.000><c> like</c><00:15:50.240><c> well</c><00:15:51.230><c> I</c><00:15:51.529><c> thought</c><00:15:51.770><c> this</c><00:15:51.920><c> would</c><00:15:52.070><c> be</c>

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.130 align:start position:0%
I was like well I thought this would be
 

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.750 align:start position:0%
I was like well I thought this would be
way<00:15:52.430><c> better</c><00:15:53.500><c> then</c><00:15:54.500><c> was</c><00:15:54.710><c> actually</c><00:15:55.400><c> here</c><00:15:55.640><c> and</c>

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
way better then was actually here and
 

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.610 align:start position:0%
way better then was actually here and
and<00:15:56.060><c> that</c><00:15:56.390><c> wasn't</c><00:15:56.660><c> even</c><00:15:56.810><c> fun</c><00:15:57.020><c> was</c><00:15:57.260><c> it</c><00:15:57.410><c> even</c>

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:57.620 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't even fun was it even
 

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't even fun was it even

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.210 align:start position:0%
worth it and now it's never enough it's
 

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.650 align:start position:0%
worth it and now it's never enough it's
like<00:15:59.270><c> never</c><00:15:59.600><c> enough</c><00:15:59.990><c> and</c><00:16:00.500><c> I</c><00:16:01.310><c> just</c><00:16:01.730><c> felt</c><00:16:02.029><c> so</c>
