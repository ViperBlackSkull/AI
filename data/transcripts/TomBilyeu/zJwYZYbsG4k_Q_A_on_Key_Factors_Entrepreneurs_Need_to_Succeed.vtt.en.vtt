coming to understand the brain was how I
 

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.340 align:start position:0%
coming to understand the brain was how I

so<00:13:29.030><c> anxiety</c><00:13:30.030><c> is</c><00:13:30.320><c> literally</c><00:13:31.320><c> a</c><00:13:31.590><c> mental</c><00:13:32.780><c> wiring</c>

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
so anxiety is literally a mental wiring
 

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.350 align:start position:0%
so anxiety is literally a mental wiring
problem<00:13:34.140><c> so</c><00:13:34.320><c> you've</c><00:13:34.830><c> taken</c><00:13:35.190><c> a</c><00:13:35.580><c> stimulus</c><00:13:36.210><c> a</c>

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
problem so you've taken a stimulus a
 

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.870 align:start position:0%
problem so you've taken a stimulus a

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
situation and you've wired it to your
 

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.350 align:start position:0%

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
obsession over imagining a future that
 

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
obsession over imagining a future that
has<00:13:42.450><c> not</c><00:13:42.600><c> yet</c><00:13:42.750><c> happened</c><00:13:43.020><c> that</c><00:13:43.410><c> was</c><00:13:43.590><c> negative</c>

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
has not yet happened that was negative
 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.950 align:start position:0%
has not yet happened that was negative
and<00:13:44.340><c> so</c><00:13:44.820><c> your</c><00:13:44.970><c> brain</c><00:13:45.270><c> just</c><00:13:45.510><c> like</c><00:13:45.600><c> starts</c>

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
and so your brain just like starts
 

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.300 align:start position:0%
and so your brain just like starts
freaking<00:13:46.380><c> out</c><00:13:46.500><c> like</c><00:13:46.530><c> oh</c><00:13:46.740><c> my</c><00:13:46.860><c> god</c><00:13:47.010><c> this</c>

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:47.310 align:start position:0%
freaking out like oh my god this
 

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.770 align:start position:0%
freaking out like oh my god this
scenario<00:13:47.760><c> like</c><00:13:47.880><c> it</c><00:13:48.030><c> could</c><00:13:48.150><c> go</c><00:13:48.270><c> wrong</c><00:13:48.450><c> all</c>

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
scenario like it could go wrong all
 

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
scenario like it could go wrong all
these<00:13:48.990><c> ways</c><00:13:49.320><c> and</c><00:13:49.680><c> so</c><00:13:50.220><c> you</c><00:13:50.280><c> begin</c><00:13:50.580><c> to</c><00:13:50.640><c> hardwire</c>

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.210 align:start position:0%
these ways and so you begin to hardwire
 

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
these ways and so you begin to hardwire
for<00:13:51.420><c> that</c><00:13:51.540><c> and</c><00:13:51.750><c> so</c><00:13:51.930><c> you</c><00:13:52.470><c> allow</c><00:13:52.770><c> your</c><00:13:53.010><c> brain</c><00:13:53.190><c> to</c>

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.250 align:start position:0%
for that and so you allow your brain to
 

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.130 align:start position:0%
for that and so you allow your brain to

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:17.790 align:start position:0%
whatever what's happening is you're
 

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.730 align:start position:0%
whatever what's happening is you're
myelinating<00:15:18.540><c> so</c><00:15:18.780><c> then</c><00:15:18.930><c> the</c><00:15:19.170><c> electrical</c>

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
myelinating so then the electrical
 

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
myelinating so then the electrical
impulses<00:15:20.190><c> can</c><00:15:20.340><c> travel</c><00:15:20.610><c> faster</c><00:15:21.420><c> between</c><00:15:21.930><c> those</c>

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:22.530 align:start position:0%
impulses can travel faster between those
 

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
impulses can travel faster between those
neurons<00:15:22.890><c> and</c><00:15:23.100><c> that's</c><00:15:23.310><c> really</c><00:15:23.640><c> what</c><00:15:24.180><c> getting</c>

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:24.810 align:start position:0%
neurons and that's really what getting
 

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
neurons and that's really what getting
good<00:15:25.110><c> at</c><00:15:25.260><c> something</c><00:15:25.530><c> is</c><00:15:25.740><c> you</c><00:15:26.430><c> build</c><00:15:26.670><c> this</c>

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:26.850 align:start position:0%
good at something is you build this
 

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.790 align:start position:0%
good at something is you build this
really<00:15:27.180><c> densely</c><00:15:27.540><c> connected</c><00:15:27.810><c> set</c><00:15:28.410><c> of</c><00:15:28.590><c> neurons</c>

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
really densely connected set of neurons
 

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.230 align:start position:0%
really densely connected set of neurons
so

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
so
they<00:15:29.420><c> can</c><00:15:29.540><c> communicate</c><00:15:29.930><c> very</c><00:15:30.529><c> rapidly</c><00:15:31.390><c> and</c>

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.410 align:start position:0%
they can communicate very rapidly and
 

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.570 align:start position:0%
they can communicate very rapidly and
that's<00:15:33.410><c> it</c><00:15:33.589><c> like</c><00:15:33.740><c> once</c><00:15:34.010><c> I</c><00:15:34.100><c> could</c><00:15:34.220><c> understand</c>

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:34.580 align:start position:0%
that's it like once I could understand
 

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's it like once I could understand
that<00:15:34.610><c> then</c><00:15:34.880><c> it</c><00:15:34.940><c> was</c><00:15:35.029><c> like</c><00:15:35.120><c> wait</c><00:15:35.480><c> a</c><00:15:35.510><c> second</c><00:15:35.839><c> I've</c>

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:35.930 align:start position:0%
that then it was like wait a second I've
 

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.510 align:start position:0%
that then it was like wait a second I've
created<00:15:36.230><c> what</c><00:15:36.800><c> Tony</c><00:15:36.980><c> Robbins</c><00:15:37.310><c> calls</c><00:15:37.459><c> a</c>

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
created what Tony Robbins calls a
 

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.280 align:start position:0%

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:44.810 align:start position:0%
right for me like learning business was
 

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
right for me like learning business was

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.380 align:start position:0%
anxiety was in a high-stress environment

happening at first like if I had caught
 

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
happening at first like if I had caught
it<00:16:02.930><c> early</c><00:16:03.260><c> uh</c><00:16:03.290><c> yeah</c><00:16:04.220><c> but</c><00:16:04.820><c> I</c><00:16:04.880><c> didn't</c><00:16:05.149><c> understand</c>

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:05.450 align:start position:0%
it early uh yeah but I didn't understand
 

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.850 align:start position:0%
it early uh yeah but I didn't understand
the<00:16:05.540><c> brain</c><00:16:05.690><c> well</c><00:16:05.899><c> enough</c><00:16:06.110><c> who</c><00:16:06.230><c> knows</c><00:16:06.260><c> going</c><00:16:06.649><c> on</c>

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:06.860 align:start position:0%
the brain well enough who knows going on
 

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.250 align:start position:0%
the brain well enough who knows going on
so<00:16:07.040><c> I</c><00:16:07.070><c> like</c><00:16:07.339><c> it's</c><00:16:07.520><c> been</c><00:16:07.640><c> years</c><00:16:08.230><c> myelinating</c>

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:09.260 align:start position:0%

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
would exit the parking garage by going
 

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.389 align:start position:0%
would exit the parking garage by going
right<00:16:32.959><c> for</c><00:16:33.230><c> whatever</c><00:16:33.380><c> reason</c><00:16:33.829><c> and</c><00:16:34.010><c> one</c><00:16:34.250><c> day</c>

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
right for whatever reason and one day
 

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
right for whatever reason and one day
like<00:16:34.640><c> someone</c><00:16:34.880><c> was</c><00:16:34.970><c> coming</c><00:16:35.089><c> or</c><00:16:35.270><c> something</c><00:16:35.480><c> and</c>

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:35.570 align:start position:0%
like someone was coming or something and
 

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
like someone was coming or something and
so<00:16:35.630><c> I</c><00:16:35.660><c> turned</c><00:16:35.930><c> left</c><00:16:35.959><c> and</c><00:16:36.260><c> it</c><00:16:36.320><c> gave</c><00:16:36.410><c> me</c><00:16:36.440><c> anxiety</c>

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:36.649 align:start position:0%
so I turned left and it gave me anxiety
 

00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:40.060 align:start position:0%
so I turned left and it gave me anxiety
and<00:16:37.520><c> I</c><00:16:37.579><c> was</c><00:16:37.700><c> like</c><00:16:38.380><c> why</c><00:16:39.380><c> would</c><00:16:39.560><c> I</c><00:16:39.589><c> have</c><00:16:39.709><c> anxiety</c>

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.070 align:start position:0%
and I was like why would I have anxiety
 

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.410 align:start position:0%
and I was like why would I have anxiety
but<00:16:40.190><c> and</c><00:16:40.430><c> so</c><00:16:40.730><c> then</c><00:16:40.850><c> I</c><00:16:40.880><c> start</c><00:16:41.149><c> learning</c><00:16:41.240><c> about</c>

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:41.420 align:start position:0%
but and so then I start learning about
 

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.540 align:start position:0%
but and so then I start learning about
generalized<00:16:42.110><c> anxiety</c><00:16:42.350><c> and</c><00:16:42.890><c> how</c><00:16:43.040><c> like</c><00:16:43.250><c> if</c><00:16:43.370><c> you</c>

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:43.550 align:start position:0%
generalized anxiety and how like if you
 

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.340 align:start position:0%
generalized anxiety and how like if you
don't<00:16:43.730><c> catch</c><00:16:44.209><c> it</c><00:16:44.240><c> like</c><00:16:44.630><c> you</c><00:16:44.990><c> start</c><00:16:45.200><c> to</c><00:16:45.260><c> get</c>

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
don't catch it like you start to get
 

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.050 align:start position:0%
don't catch it like you start to get
anxious<00:16:45.529><c> about</c><00:16:45.709><c> random</c><00:16:46.610><c> like</c><00:16:46.910><c> yeah</c>

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.060 align:start position:0%
anxious about random like yeah
 

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.730 align:start position:0%
anxious about random like yeah
whatever<00:16:47.420><c> so</c><00:16:47.959><c> I</c><00:16:48.020><c> was</c><00:16:48.140><c> like</c><00:16:48.230><c> okay</c><00:16:48.529><c> wait</c><00:16:48.709><c> a</c>

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740 align:start position:0%
whatever so I was like okay wait a
 

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.870 align:start position:0%
whatever so I was like okay wait a
second<00:16:49.130><c> so</c><00:16:49.250><c> then</c><00:16:49.399><c> I</c><00:16:49.430><c> had</c><00:16:49.640><c> to</c><00:16:49.730><c> start</c>

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.980 align:start position:0%
second so then I had to start

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:24.630 align:start position:0%
are probably on a continuum and that
 

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
are probably on a continuum and that

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
nerves are like and like the beginning
 

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.659 align:start position:0%
nerves are like and like the beginning
of<00:18:27.570><c> something</c><00:18:27.630><c> and</c><00:18:28.530><c> then</c><00:18:28.620><c> anxiety</c><00:18:29.280><c> is</c><00:18:29.370><c> a</c><00:18:29.400><c> more</c>

00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:29.669 align:start position:0%
of something and then anxiety is a more
 

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
of something and then anxiety is a more

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.130 align:start position:0%

00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that will actually make
 

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:50.030 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that will actually make

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
this imagined reality come true so
 

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
this imagined reality come true so
understanding<00:19:50.640><c> all</c><00:19:50.760><c> of</c><00:19:50.790><c> this</c><00:19:50.970><c> was</c><00:19:51.179><c> like</c><00:19:51.360><c> this</c>

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:52.169 align:start position:0%
understanding all of this was like this
 

00:19:52.169 --> 00:19:54.169 align:start position:0%
understanding all of this was like this
is<00:19:52.440><c> the</c><00:19:52.620><c> dumbest</c><00:19:53.159><c> thing</c><00:19:53.340><c> ever</c>

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
is the dumbest thing ever
 

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:56.419 align:start position:0%
is the dumbest thing ever
so<00:19:54.299><c> getting</c><00:19:54.869><c> anxious</c><00:19:55.200><c> about</c><00:19:55.499><c> it</c><00:19:55.740><c> is</c><00:19:55.889><c> actually</c>

00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:56.429 align:start position:0%
so getting anxious about it is actually
 

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.430 align:start position:0%
so getting anxious about it is actually
going<00:19:56.580><c> to</c><00:19:56.730><c> make</c><00:19:56.820><c> me</c><00:19:56.999><c> perform</c><00:19:57.389><c> poorly</c><00:19:57.629><c> so</c><00:19:58.259><c> now</c>

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to make me perform poorly so now
 

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.169 align:start position:0%
going to make me perform poorly so now

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:02.129 align:start position:0%
I might become anxious so it's like this
 

00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:05.090 align:start position:0%
I might become anxious so it's like this
weird<00:20:02.700><c> like</c><00:20:03.509><c> loop</c><00:20:03.809><c> and</c><00:20:04.080><c> you</c><00:20:04.559><c> know</c><00:20:04.740><c> that</c><00:20:04.950><c> it's</c>
