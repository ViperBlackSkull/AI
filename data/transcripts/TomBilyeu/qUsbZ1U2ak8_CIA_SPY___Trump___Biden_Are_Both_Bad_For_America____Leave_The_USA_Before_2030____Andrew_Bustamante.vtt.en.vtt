extremely thoughtful and I think a
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.910 align:start position:0%
extremely thoughtful and I think a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
hyperoral person um but I also think
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.109 align:start position:0%
hyperoral person um but I also think
he's<00:01:11.119><c> wrong</c><00:01:11.320><c> about</c><00:01:11.520><c> this</c><00:01:12.159><c> so</c><00:01:12.720><c> my</c><00:01:12.960><c> thing</c><00:01:13.240><c> is</c>

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
he's wrong about this so my thing is
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
he's wrong about this so my thing is
okay<00:01:14.479><c> I</c><00:01:14.560><c> think</c><00:01:14.759><c> the</c><00:01:15.000><c> real</c><00:01:15.439><c> problem</c><00:01:15.799><c> we</c><00:01:16.040><c> have</c><00:01:16.520><c> is</c>

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay I think the real problem we have is
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 align:start position:0%
okay I think the real problem we have is
we<00:01:17.439><c> don't</c><00:01:17.799><c> agree</c><00:01:18.759><c> on</c><00:01:19.520><c> what</c><00:01:19.880><c> constitutes</c><00:01:20.720><c> an</c>

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.149 align:start position:0%
existential threat I actually don't know
that<00:01:22.880><c> we</c><00:01:23.159><c> disagree</c><00:01:23.920><c> about</c><00:01:24.200><c> what</c><00:01:24.320><c> to</c><00:01:24.479><c> do</c><00:01:24.799><c> in</c><00:01:24.960><c> the</c>

like<00:01:28.200><c> when</c><00:01:28.400><c> I</c><00:01:28.600><c> look</c><00:01:28.759><c> at</c><00:01:29.040><c> Trump</c><00:01:29.320><c> getting</c>

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
like when I look at Trump getting

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
the same time I don't see it as an
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
the same time I don't see it as an
