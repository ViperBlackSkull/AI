00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so I would say this is if I could
 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so I would say this is if I could

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 align:start position:0%
explain kind of how I did it I guess I
 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
explain kind of how I did it I guess I
would<00:07:04.720><c> say</c><00:07:04.840><c> because</c><00:07:05.020><c> this</c><00:07:05.140><c> is</c><00:07:05.200><c> what</c><00:07:05.290><c> I</c><00:07:05.320><c> try</c><00:07:05.500><c> to</c>

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 align:start position:0%
would say because this is what I try to
 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
would say because this is what I try to
make<00:07:05.740><c> sure</c><00:07:05.860><c> that</c><00:07:05.980><c> I</c><00:07:06.040><c> keep</c><00:07:06.220><c> doing</c><00:07:06.370><c> every</c><00:07:07.240><c> single</c>

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
make sure that I keep doing every single
 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.570 align:start position:0%
make sure that I keep doing every single

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
learned once I got there and then I
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
