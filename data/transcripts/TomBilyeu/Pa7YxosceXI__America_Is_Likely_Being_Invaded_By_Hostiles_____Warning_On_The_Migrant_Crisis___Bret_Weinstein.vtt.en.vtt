00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
then as the person that's just armchair
 

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.949 align:start position:0%
then as the person that's just armchair
quarterbacking<00:15:18.720><c> it</c><00:15:18.920><c> I'll</c><00:15:19.120><c> give</c><00:15:19.240><c> you</c><00:15:19.480><c> sort</c><00:15:19.639><c> of</c>

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
quarterbacking it I'll give you sort of
 

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:22.150 align:start position:0%
