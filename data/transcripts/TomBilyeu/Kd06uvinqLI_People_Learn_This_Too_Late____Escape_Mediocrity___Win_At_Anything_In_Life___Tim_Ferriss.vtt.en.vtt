00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.630
Tom: Hey everybody, welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.969
You're here because you believe that human
potential is nearly limitless but you know

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.420
that having potential is not the same as actually
doing something with it.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.710
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.060
will help you execute on your dreams.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.350
All right.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.090
Today's guest is the king of self optimization.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.850
A man who is constantly learning and testing
new theories in the real world so that he

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.460
can improve his skill set and do more.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.850
His ridiculous list of accomplishments is
proof that if you approach the world as a

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.260
student there's no such thing as the impossible.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.780
Here are just a few of the seemingly unreal,
albeit, entirely true highlights from his

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.780
resume.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.130
He's a former MTV break dancer in Taiwan,
the one time national Chinese kickboxing champion,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.219
the first American to hold the Guinness world
record in tango, a horseback archer, Princeton

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.210
University guest lecturer, and angel investor
who has racked up a serious string of entrepreneurial

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.750
maga hits, including Uber, Facebook, Twitter,
and Alibaba.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.610
He is an unparalleled, self experimenter,
professional note taker, and would be ninth

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.080
grade teacher, but you probably know him better
for his best selling books "The 4-hour Work

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.780
Week", "The 4-hour Body", and "The 4-hour
Chef".

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.010
Or perhaps you're more familiar with his number
one iTunes TV show, or his unbelievably popular

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.600
podcast, which has been downloaded more than
one hundred million times.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.869
But even if you don't know him from any of
that you're certainly going to know him for

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.619
his most recent book, "Tools of Titans: The
Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires,

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.810
Icons, and World Class Performers."

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.479
He's been called the Oprah of audio and the
Indiana Jones for the digital age, please

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.869
help me in welcoming the New York Times best
selling author multiple times over, the man

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.060
behind the Tim Ferriss Show.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.260
The human guinea pig himself, Tim Ferriss.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Tim: Hey man.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.079
Tom: Awesome my brother, how you doing?

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.000
Tim: Good to see you again.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.840
Tom: Good to see you as well man.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.230
Tim: It's all downhill after that intro.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.599
Tom: I'm not so sure about that.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.599
The sheer weight of this bad boy ...
Tim: I know.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.870
Tom: ... Tells me that it's not gonna be all
downhill from here.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.520
Tim: It was supposed to be one sentence a
page.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.470
Maybe a little check out book in the aisle.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.379
I can't help myself.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.920
Tom: Yeah I saw that.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.819
If you had to boil it down to one sentence,
what was your purpose in writing it?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.640
Tim: The purpose in writing it was to create
the ultimate cliff notes for myself and then

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.660
I got about halfway through it and one of
my friends was taking a look at it and he

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.319
goes, "This is exactly what your readers would
want.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.260
Why don't you just publish it?"

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.170
And that led ultimately to the book, which
is about half new material.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.849
I would say 50 to 60% brand new.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.980
Some brand new recommendations from past guests,
new guests that people haven't met yet like

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.440
Jack Dorsey, who's a very impressive cat,
and Cheryl Strayed and many others but the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.930
six to 10,000 of pages of transcripts got
boiled down to about 350 pages in here and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.940
the vetting process was choosing what I had
had a chance to apply myself or something

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.240
my close friends had applied at the highest
levels.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.870
Tom: Some of the people that you've interviewed
in the book, Peter Thiel being the first one

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.230
that comes to mind of just mega producers
or Reid Hoffman.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.470
I mean it is absurd the number of people that
you've come in contact with that are just

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.100
absolute apex predators in the world of whatever
it is that they do.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.370
I mean it's really, really incredible.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.260
Tim: So Amelia Boone, I don't know if you've
ever met her.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.519
She's so tough.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.330
My god, she's a three time World's Toughest
Mudder champion.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.530
She is full time attorney at Apple.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.530
Tom: Woah.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.750
Tim: She, in the 2012 Toughest Mudder, which
is a 24 hour race.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.100
You have to complete a course of obstacles
for as many repetitions as you can and she's

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.540
done more than 90 miles in that case but it's
like climbing ropes and carry-

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.610
Tom: 90 miles of obstacles?

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.400
Tim: Of obstacles and in eight weeks of after
knee surgery more than 1,000 competitors,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.690
90% plus of which are men, she came in second
place.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.740
Tom: Oh my god.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.760
Tim: Out of everybody.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.010
Tom: What do you think drives her?

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.280
Like that's crazy.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:29.350
She's super successful but you don't do 90
miles in a 24 hour period without some intense

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.699
thing pushing you forward, if you had to guess.

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:38.180
Tim: If I had to guess I think it is pretty
simple.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.410
Now with endurance, ultra endurance athletes,
one of the common questions is are you running

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.169
towards something or are you running from
something?

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.169
Tom: Yeah, for sure.

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.419
Tim: Two things I really like about Amelia.

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.930
Number one, what would you put on a billboard
if you could put anything on a huge billboard?

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.930
Tom: I love that question.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.990
Tim: "No one owes you anything."

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.310
[crosstalk 00:04:56] That's her answer, so
great, and then her other quote which I had

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.470
to put right on the top of her chapter was,
"I'm not the strongest, I'm not the fastest,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.040
but I'm really good at suffering."

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.919
Tom: Yeah.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.990
Why does that resonate with you?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.370
Because that sits at the core of my being,
that very notion.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.370
Tim: Out endure.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.720
You can train yourself to out endure other
people.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.940
Tom: It really ... So when I think about what
gifts, you've talked about this before.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.190
Like everybody has a superpower and one of
my superpowers is the ability to suffer.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.190
Tim: Yeah.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.940
Tom: And it's one of those things that you
say and you know it's kinda tongue in cheek

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.330
and a little bit funny but at the same time
it's my fucking super power.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.669
Like people look at me and say, "Okay, well
how have you been able to do this?"

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.040
Because truly you spend enough time with me
you will know very, very quickly I am not

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.500
the brightest person and I don't pride myself
in that so that's not like, I don't ... I'm

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.960
not torn up about it.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960
Tim: Yeah.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.790
Tom: Not the brightest person.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.509
Didn't have any extreme advantages or anything
growing up.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:54.570
Certainly not physically more impressive than
the next person but my willingness to suffer

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.280
is absurd ...
Tim: Yeah.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.760
Tom: ... And when you direct that at something
that you care about, my whole thing is the

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.340
way that I think about it is I'll outlast
anyone, right?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.169
On a long enough timeline I can accomplish
and when people really start to look at that

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.660
but then it comes back to the next question,
which I want to know from you is what is the

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.660
driver?

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.460
What's that thing that makes you be so willing
to suffer?

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.560
Tim: It's the promise of that crack hit for
me, which is the aha moment.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.900
Tom: In you or in you and other people?

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:38.000
Tim: It's both and the reason I get such a
high from it is if I can crack the code in

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.940
the sense that I find something that saves
people hundreds of hours or myself hundreds

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.350
of hours in the learning curve for a particular
skill or a particular type of recovery or

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.819
fill in the bank, just an elegant or non-obvious
solution to a longstanding problem, I'm like,

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:03.740
"Okay, I can't wait to see how people are
gonna respond when I provide that to 1,000

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:10.699
people and I see, for most of them, the vast
majority just go holy fuck."

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.099
If you take someone for instance I didn't
learn how to swim until I was in my 30s.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.319
I think we may have talked about this.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:21.039
I grew up in Long Island but I was deathly
afraid of drowning because I had some near-drowning

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.199
incidents and some lung issues.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.490
Now at this point I was taught by this gentleman
named Terry Lockland something called total

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.220
immersion, which I first learned from a book
which I was introduced to by Chris Sacca who's

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.289
a billionaire investor in this book oddly
enough.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:41.970
But you can take someone, which I did with
Terry at one point for the Tim Ferriss Experiment,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.099
the first TV show I did.

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:49.141
This mother of two I think, Sarah, who had
never been able to swim, couldn't even put

00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:55.669
her head under water in the pool comfortably
and four days later open water swimming 500

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:03.080
meters in the ocean in like 40-foot deep water
freestyle and when you show someone an impossible

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.900
like that, it's not only possible but that
they can crack it really quickly, that's my

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.670
drug of choice.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.400
I just get such a high out of it.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.949
The other thing, why am I willing to suffer?

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:20.099
I'm willing to suffer because I guess much
like you I feel like I have my deficiencies.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.610
I have plenty of weaknesses.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:28.509
To go to the extreme is partially present
because I feel like the most interesting things

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:29.870
happen at the fringes first.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.690
Tom: Reading the press kit for your book,
I had that overwhelming sense of holy hell,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.019
what you've just spent the last however many
years collecting are all of those gems that

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:43.000
either other people just haven't aggregated
or they haven't distilled or they haven't

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
been willing to look at.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Tim: Yeah.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.180
Tom: But now exists in one place, which is
incredibly exciting.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:57.980
Now one of the promises in the press kit was
that you could test the impossible in 17 questions.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.980
Tim: Yeah.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.150
Tom: What are some of the questions?

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:10.660
Tim: So the questions are actual questions
that coincided with milestones or inflection

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.920
points or just a fork in my own life.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.910
It's actually laid out these questions, about
12 of them, coincided with exact points that

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.960
I can remember.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.700
Some of them would be, for instance, what
if I did the opposite for 48 hours?

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.530
This is a question that I ask myself when
I had my first job out of college.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.530
Talk about suffering.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.030
I mean my desk was in the fire exit.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.710
It was completely illegal.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:43.050
I slept under the desk, the whole nine yards
and don't regret a minute of it but I was

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.860
a technical sales guy.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.440
Outbound sales guy, so we had inside sales
and outside sales and my job was to close

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.290
deals with CTO's and CEO's for multi-million
dollar data storage systems.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.460
At that point storage area networks fiber
channel and what I realized at one point was

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.480
that all of the seasoned sales guys, who were
doing far better than I was doing, were making

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.050
phone calls between nine and five.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:14.890
Those were the office hours and I said, "Well,
I'm clearly not doing an effective job mimicking

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:15.890
them.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.290
What if I did the opposite for 48 hours?"

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.350
It's a very recoverable experiment.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.500
If it doesn't work, then I can always go back
to what I was doing.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:32.230
Doing the opposite meant making the calls
between let's just say 6:30 and 8:30 and then

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:40.800
5:30 to 7:00, 7:30 and it was just a hypothesis.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.050
Maybe I can get a hold of the people I need
to get a hold of more effectively when the

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.740
gatekeepers aren't there and that's exactly
what happened.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.450
I started booking more meetings and closing
more deals than the majority of the guys in

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.400
the company and it was just from asking that
question.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.760
What if I did the opposite for 48 hours and
you can apply that to many, many things.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:08.510
Some of the others would be, well, this is
one I asked in 2004.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.750
If I had a gun against my head and could only
work two hours per week, what would I do?

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.519
I know it's impossible, what would I do?

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:25.170
And that type of ludicrous question was necessary
to break my thinking patterns and stress test

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:31.990
my own assumptions of what was possible and
you find that that is a learnable skill.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:37.450
Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize,
who's really good at these types of questions.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.320
I mean he's attempting to solve some of the
biggest problems facing humanity in very innovative

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.300
ways.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.700
He would ask, for instance, start ups who
come to him for angel investment.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:54.600
He'll say, "What would you have to do in the
next six months," I'm paraphrasing here.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600
Tom: Sure.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.269
Tim: "... To 10X the economics of your business?"

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:01.190
And if they say it can't be done, he's like
I do not accept your answer.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.649
Literally he just says, "I do not accept your
answer, try again."

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:08.670
What's very important here is to realize the
expectation is not that you'll magically in

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:14.580
10 minutes come up with a plan to achieve
your 10 year goals in six months but that

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.280
you may get halfway there, right?

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.089
Tom: And largely just to shift your paradigm,
right?

00:12:21.089 --> 00:12:27.389
I know Peter very well and his whole thing
is if you're ... Naturally we think linearly,

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:28.389
right?

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:33.140
Until you break out of that and start thinking
exponentially, you're never going to get the

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.120
kind of breakthroughs that you want.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.320
There's two things I think that people don't
understand about being an entrepreneur.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.800
Number one is there's a ton of mundane stuff
that you're gonna have to do, like this set.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.930
My wife and I were hand painting it, which
is stupid by the way.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.950
It should've been done and sprayed but we
found ourselves in a situation where that

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.800
shit had to be hand painted.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.300
As I'm going through, literally at 3:00 AM,
painting this set I thought this is the part

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.529
of being an entrepreneur that people don't
see coming.

00:12:58.529 --> 00:13:00.050
Tim: That's not on the magazine covers.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.610
Tom: Yeah exactly, so it's like and do you
right your willingness to suffer?

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.610
Do you gut check?

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.610
Do you get through?

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:11.290
And then the other thing is how do you break
out of your dogmatic linear thinking to get

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.019
through to the big aha moment?

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:16.240
The I have a gun to my head, I only have two
hours which then becomes the four-hour workweek

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.130
because of a Google test and they thought
that it was ridiculous that it'd be two hours.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.130
Nobody's gonna believe that.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:25.990
I love that story, which then obviously has
massive paradigm shifting changes in people

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:31.570
and what I find so fascinating about asking
what is it that I would need to do or what

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.399
would stop me from executing a 10 year plan
in six months is it forces you to sort of

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:40.050
abandon all hope of clinging to what you already
know.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.360
That's the only time that you're gonna do
something differently is you have to approach

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.200
the problem from a radically different way.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.310
Take Uber for a second.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:53.449
Uber was one of those few ideas that the second
I saw it, I was like, "Oh my god, that's so

00:13:53.449 --> 00:14:01.670
brilliant," but I had never stopped to ask
the question, "What would it take?"

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.680
Riding in a cab stressed my ability to suffer,
right?

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.019
That's how much I fucking hated riding in
cabs.

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:09.940
It's just such a bad experience.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.959
Drivers are horrible to you.

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:14.170
The cars are disgusting.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.639
If you call them and have to wait, I mean
it's a joke right.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:19.380
All of it is just terrible terrible but I
never asked the question.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.910
What would it take to revolutionize this?

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.959
Getting down to asking these wildly divergent
questions, and I love your question about

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:32.260
what if I did the opposite, because by definition
it shatters the dogma.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Tim: Yeah.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.949
Even if you don't think it's gonna work, what
if I do the opposite for 48 hours?

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:42.709
Even if I'm almost 100% or 100% sure it's
not gonna work or be beneficial, as long as

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:44.990
you cap the downside in someway right?

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.089
Tom: Do you red team blue team?

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:50.190
Tim: I do, oh yeah.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.060
Red teaming, for those people that don't know,
this comes from military.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:01.660
It could be in any division of the military
where they'll take, let's just say, five guys

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:08.220
blue team, five guys designate them red team
and the job of the red team is to either,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:13.800
say, get into a building that the blue team
is supposed to protect, defeat defenses that

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.790
the blue team has created, or you can do this
in a corporate setting and Marc Andreessen

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:26.100
who's another billionaire and just fascinating
guy, incredible engineer also.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.769
They'll red team ideas.

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:33.260
They will create what he would call a counter
veiling force.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:39.300
If we're in a venture capital general partner
meeting and you come up with what you think

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.420
is a great thesis or a great company, even
if I think it's a good idea I will and I'll

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.950
take several other people and we will attack
it and try to tear it to death, tear it to

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.310
pieces and he calls it the torture test.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.279
That is also a form of red teaming, so I'll
do that with all sorts of things.

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:02.910
Tom: I also find that red teaming, like being
on the red team itself, sharpens your own

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.910
thinking.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.130
One, it's just a good exercise to be able
to put yourself in the other side so you don't

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.850
have to have other people always to red team.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.160
You can actually flip over.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
Tim: Yep.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.590
Tom: Back in high school I used to do speech
and debate and in debate you had to take both

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.590
sides of the argument.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.150
You had to be able to go back and forth.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.680
It made you so much more compelling because
you knew the weaknesses of both sides because

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.259
you got used to playing that.

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:25.259
Tim: Yeah.

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:30.329
Tom: And so like in the military where in
that moment you are investing everything into

00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:31.949
getting into that space, right?

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.889
I'm going to break the US defenses.

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:35.399
I'm going to get into this room.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.380
I'm going to show them that I'm better, right?

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.541
If you can, and we do that here at Impact
Theory, is to put yourself ... Even if you

00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:47.980
don't end up debunking it, practice being
able to put yourself on the other side.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.980
Tim: For sure.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.959
Tom: Because one of the things, dude, I fear
this more than I can tell you which is getting

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:55.480
trapped in my own dogma because I need to
codify the world.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480
I need it.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480
Tim: Yeah.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.660
Tom: Which is why this book is so fucking
interesting to me because it's basically a

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.389
bunch of codifications that are instantly
powerful.

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:05.610
They have that punch, you follow it up with
their own contextual stuff, which I think

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:10.600
is brilliant by the way, but you're giving
the codifications but in codifying the world

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.589
it tends to calcify for me, right?

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:13.589
Tim: Sure, sure.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:19.319
Tom: And when you look at genius being a young
man's game it's like I didn't get enough done

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.360
in my youth youth to be okay with that.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.150
I have done nothing that is going to earn
my a Nobel prize, let's start with that.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.789
Tim: Oh me neither, for what it's worth.

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:33.320
Tom: To continue to do profound things, it's
like you have to reinvent yourself.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.720
We just had Michael Strahan on the show and
his business partner Constance, who's just

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.880
an unbelievably talented woman and she has
every 10 years forced herself to do a totally

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880
new career.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880
Tim: Cool.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.080
Tom: Which is amazing and he was saying that's
basically what makes her so effective because

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.730
she's not drawing on the moment, she's drawing
on all these different angles of attack onto

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:56.730
her core skill set.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.820
Tim: Right, so one of the questions that you
can also ask, just like what if I did the

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.510
opposite for 48 hours, I'll give you another
question that I think you'll really like.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.580
It's one of the 17.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.800
What can I learn from the people I hate the
most?

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800
Tom: Wow.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.669
Tim: Now this does two things.

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:19.530
It forces you to separate your morality from
your search for effectiveness.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:27.290
It also helps you to develop some degree of
empathy and those two are very powerful.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:33.020
What can I learn from the people I hate most
is a very, very useful practice.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.820
I'll journal on that very often.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.400
In terms of patterns, we were talking about
some of the things I've spotted, meditation

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.890
or journaling are performed by close to 100%
of the people that I interview.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:51.621
The question, just to come back to that that
I thought you might enjoy is, and this is

00:18:51.621 --> 00:18:58.130
an example of taking something from someone
I disagree with on almost every level.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.600
Newt Gingrich.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.929
One of the questions that Newt would ask himself
and others is are you hunting antelope or

00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:11.059
are you hunting field mice and the story he
would tell is that of a lion in the Serengeti.

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:17.559
He's like, "If you're always chasing field
mice as a lion, you'll get a snack.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:23.910
You might even survive but you might end up
starving because you're getting these little

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.320
Scooby snacks."

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.550
That's not his words, mine.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:33.660
"That make you feel good and give you the
allusion of accomplishing something real,"

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.280
and for me that's translated into are you
being busy or are you being productive?

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.360
Tom: Yes.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.430
Tim: Right?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.510
Tom: Yes.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:47.250
Tim: And that was a question, I want to say
it was about five years ago or so, this antelope

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.250
versus field mice.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:53.440
Just the story, the parable and the metaphor
was so strong for me that I put that up where

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440
I would see it everyday.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.890
Tom: All right let's take a hard right.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.330
There's some interesting stuff in here about
creativity.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.330
What are some of the most interesting and
useful lessons about creativity you pulled

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.840
from the book?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:11.260
Tim: The first that comes to mind is setting
really low expectations and this-

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.650
Tom: Not what I was expecting you to say.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.150
Tim: Well not what a lot of people expect
and when I spoke to, say, Paulo Coelho, who's

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.690
sold 100 million plus copies, The Alchemist,
et cetera.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.340
You talk to Rick Rubin.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.010
Let me give his example first.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:34.640
When he has a musician who's stuck, great
musician but they've developed performance

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.039
anxiety about song writing for whatever reason,
he will say, "Do you think you could get me

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:45.990
one sentence or maybe two words that you like
by tomorrow?

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.090
That's it, two words.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.110
Can you do that for me?"

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.210
He gives them a micro assignment.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.299
Best writing advice that I probably ever received,
and I've received a lot of good writing advice,

00:20:55.299 --> 00:21:01.020
but I can get myself really wound up because
I expect perfection to flow from my fingertips

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:07.120
like magic and that never happens so then
I beat the hell out of myself and that makes

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.700
me less likely to put pen to paper in the
first place.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.470
I'll procrastinate, which is why if you write
two crappy pages per day you've won the day.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.340
That's a successful writing day and that does
a few things.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.720
It helps you to maintain enthusiasm because
you're constantly winning and of course on

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.430
many days you'll write more than two.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.799
You'll get to two then you'll go to five or
to 10 but if you're on an off day you write

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:31.799
two crappy pages.

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:37.169
Even if you never use it, it's a successful
day and that I think for longer term projects

00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:40.549
and extended creativity is really important.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:44.840
The story that this writer told me with that
tip, he said, "Okay this is where this comes

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840
from.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:53.840
Did you know that IBM, when it was the 800
pound gorilla it was an undefeatable sales

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.630
force?

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.940
Do you know what one of their rules was?"

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.940
I was like, "No."

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.240
He says, "Well what do you think their quotas
were?"

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.130
And I was like, "Well I'm sure it was really
high because they wanted to motivate their

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.429
guys to get after it."

00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:06.200
He goes, "No their quotas were the lowest
in the industry."

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200
Tom: Wow.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.549
Tim: And the rationale was we don't want our
sales people to be intimidated to pick up

00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:11.590
the phone.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.610
We want them to feel like they're gonna pass
their quota quickly, which they did and then

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.230
they shot well past it and clobbered the competition.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.330
Tom: That's interesting.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:26.900
Tim: The counter intuitive pairing of low
expectations leading to higher performance

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.309
is really odd, right?

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:31.370
Tom: So let's ask the obvious question then.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:38.880
As somebody who's had a lot of employees at
the height I had, over 1,000 employees, that

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880
feels dangerous.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
Tim: Yeah.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.100
Tom: And it feels dangerous and I think I
have my own answer but it feels dangerous

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.650
because some people, especially when an organization
gets that big, they're looking for a place

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.549
to hide and you give it to them.

00:22:51.549 --> 00:23:05.530
Tim: Yeah I think that the winning combination
is selectively low quotas on a daily basis

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.230
with high expectations for metrics on, say,
a quarterly or annual basis.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.440
You're tracking the numbers.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.309
You want them to hit home runs but it doesn't
have to be one at-bat.

00:23:15.309 --> 00:23:21.610
I think it's also very context and role specific
but if we're talking about creativity in particular,

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:28.100
right, so not necessarily work output, the
approach ... There are a number of prolific

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.659
writers who have said, Neil Strauss said this,
"There's no such thing as writer's block,"

00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:33.659
which drives me crazy.

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:35.980
I'm like come on.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.250
You might be a mutant like X-Men of writing
but for the normal humans, come on.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.250
Give me a break.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.250
He goes, "No, no, no.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.250
Hear me out."

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.010
Number one, he is a trained journalist and
journalists tend to have writing block beaten

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:52.060
out of them because their boss is like, "Oh
you can't find the right prose for your 500

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.670
word article?

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.600
Get it in by five o'clock asshole," and they're
just like, "Oh wait, this isn't school," and

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.240
they're like, "Yeah deadline, that's your
incentive.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.080
Writer's block my ass," and he's like, "Oh
okay."

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.190
But he said and what they learn is, he said,
"There's no such thing as writer's block."

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.390
He said, "What that is is performance anxiety
that you've imposed on yourself because your

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.020
expectations are too high."

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.760
He's like, "Just lower your standards.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.130
Lower your standards until you get started."

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.039
Tom: Can I back you up here for a second?

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.039
Tim: Yeah.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:25.720
Tom: Oh god this is embarrassing but I've
at least admitted it before.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.830
When I first started doing Instagram I was
like I want to really up Instagram's game,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.340
right, so I'm gonna make these posts really
mean something and I want to actually impact

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.850
somebody and if you read one of my posts you're
going to be impacted.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:45.299
Then there was one day, nine hours later I
had lost my entire Sunday writing this Instagram

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:47.590
post and I thought, "This is not scalable.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.940
Like, you cannot write a nine hour Instagram
post."

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.590
Because like the comments would be like, "It's
long but it's worth the read."

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.020
So I thought, "Wait, people actively don't
want to read this shit.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.740
Their friend has to convince them to do it
and I just spent nine hours writing it.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.740
This is madness."

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.740
Tim: Yeah.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.680
Tom: So I said, "Okay, I'm gonna write this
stuff in 20 minutes, like, simple as and they

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.270
get what they get in 20 minutes and it is
what it is," and I started getting better

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.270
reactions.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.370
It was like oh my god.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.370
It's hilarious.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:20.750
Tim: Oh it is hilarious and I give you another
example which is Ed Catmull, president of

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.750
Pixar.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:29.779
Pixar, I mean for god sakes, I mean Pixar
and he said to me, "The early versions of

00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:32.380
our movies," and I'm paraphrasing of course
but, "They're all crap."

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.700
And he talked about a few of my favorite movies.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.900
He said, "Oh yeah, they're all crap.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.070
We have to just toss them out and start over."

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.070
I said, "Wait a second."

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.830
I backtracked and I said, "So you just mean
the movies when they start are really rough

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.600
drafts and then you have to refine them?"

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.600
He's like, "No, no, no.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.600
That's the misconception.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.429
They think the early version of the movie
is just a rough draft of the later one."

00:25:51.429 --> 00:25:52.750
He's like, "No it's completely different.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:26:00.010
We literally scrapped it and started again
from scratch and then those starting from

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.760
scratch stories became some of the most popular
successful movies."

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.450
Tom: Wow.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.200
Do you find that a lot?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.980
Because when I write I will often hit that
point where I'm like this is so bad that trying

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.690
to just continue to make it better is the
wrong idea.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:20.370
I need to start over and then if you can put
words to this next emotion you will be my

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.280
hero.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.290
You get into this dark place, right, the writing
is not going anywhere.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.169
You're not able to get it out for whatever
reason.

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:33.929
That concept that you can feel in your mind,
you can't articulate and get it on paper and

00:26:33.929 --> 00:26:35.010
then you get this moment.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:41.350
For me a lot of times I just get angry enough
that that then becomes that energy that I

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.760
need and you talk about putting one song on
repeat.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.039
I've used this song a lot, is the song 'Faint'
by Linkin Park.

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.039
Tim: Yeah.

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:51.039
Tom: Which is hyper aggressive.

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.039
Tim: Yeah.

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:56.870
Tom: And I'll put that on over and over and
over to keep that energy because if I get

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.240
angry enough at my shit writing, I get this
breakthrough moment where I can start from

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:07.571
scratch and all of a sudden I can feel my
brain speed up and then I can write but it

00:27:07.571 --> 00:27:10.090
took like that however much time of getting
fed up.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.029
If you can put words around that moment.

00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:17.480
Tim: Well I'll put a phrase to that moment.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480
Tom: Perfect.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.481
Tim: "What makes you angry," was one of the
key pieces of advice that I was given by a

00:27:22.481 --> 00:27:24.120
writer named Po Bronson.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.000
When I asked him what do you do when you have
writer's block, he said, "What makes you angry?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.500
Just write that."

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:34.799
And that was also the advice that I was given
by Whitney Cummings and a few other stand

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:36.340
up comedians.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.340
How do you develop material?

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.340
What makes you angry?

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.390
Write about that.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:45.530
I think anger, as opposed to just labeling
it a bad thing, can be very useful fuel.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.940
So what makes you angry and let's just say
you're writing about something that doesn't

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.230
require or seem to require anger.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.240
Well, if you can't get started it doesn't
matter, so write about something else.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.640
Write about what makes you angry and either
you'll be able to sort of parry that into

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.850
this other subject once you get going or you'll
end up writing something completely different

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.850
and it'll end up better in the first place.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.640
Tom: And what does it mean to copyright your
faults?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.040
Tim: Ah yeah, this is a great one.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.920
Copyright your faults, this is from Dan Carlin.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.820
Dan Carlin is the host of my favorite podcast.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.220
It's just incredible.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.220
'Hardcore History'.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.220
Tom: Yes.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.190
Tim: And anyone who hasn't heard it should
start with Wrath of the Khans.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.490
If you have to buy it, buy it.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.899
Trust me but copyrighting your faults.

00:28:32.899 --> 00:28:40.240
Dan was a radio guy before he was a podcast
guy and he was constantly getting criticized

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.730
because he would go into the red.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.841
He would shout and he was really loud and
he'd go up and he'd peak and drive all the

00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:52.410
audio people crazy and then he'd get really
low and whisper and they're just like, "Dude,

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.410
come on.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.420
You're killing me here.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:02.460
Making my job really hard," and his supervisors
at the time they're like, "Look kid.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.460
What people want is this deep dignified baritone
voice for the radio."

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.610
I don't have voice for the radio so I can't
do it but-

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.450
Tom: Says the guy with 100 million downloads
by the way.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.450
Tim: Yeah right, right.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.450
Exactly.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.850
Tom: Which is terrible timing, I've been meaning
to tell you.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.850
Tim: Oh thank you.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.390
It's time to do the reveal now.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.390
Tom: Right.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:26.180
Tim: But that's a whole separate story, the
accidental podcast but later on he had such

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:32.900
a distinctive voice that people started complimenting
him and he's like, "Okay."

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:39.010
Now this so-called weakness that he was unable
to fix so he didn't fix it, not only that

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:44.440
but he avoided fixing it by having the intro
guys, the guys who'd be like, "Please welcome

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.860
or please enjoy blah blah blah, Dan Carlin,"
and he'd say, "He shouts, he whispers," or

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.860
something like that.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:56.149
He had the intro guy do a caveat so that he
didn't have to change his personal style,

00:29:56.149 --> 00:30:02.560
which later then became this huge asset and
his term is copyright your faults.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.720
Now if someone imitates me, that's my jam.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.529
That's my shtick.

00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:12.160
Copyright your faults and of course there
are weaknesses you should address but then

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.810
there are flaws that can be converted into
strengths.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:25.100
I think that's another way to catalyze creativity
or just creating anything is to realize that

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.780
some of your biggest flaws may in fact be
assets.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.780
Tom: Right.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.580
Tim: And so that could be a question you ask,
right?

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.370
How might some of my biggest weaknesses be
strengths or assets?

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:42.460
I think that's a very useful question to journal
on which I tend to do just about every morning

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.460
is freehand journaling in what are called
'morning pages'.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:51.060
Okay we're talking about creativity, morning
pages we should talk about.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:57.320
Julia Cameron describes them as spiritual
windshield wipers and the way I would translate

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.950
that is when you do morning pages, and you
might just be complaining.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.429
Like your lesser self, your worse self coming
out on pages.

00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:09.710
Just bitching and moaning is you get that
out of your system for the day so you don't

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.539
have it ricocheting around your head like
a stray bullet for the rest of your waking

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:15.330
hours interrupting everything else.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:21.370
You just trap it, you freeze it on paper and
that practice has been tremendously liberating

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:26.830
not only from a well being standpoint but
from just freeing up my CPU so that I can

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.279
focus on things that are more important.

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:32.029
If I have all that, "That guy and that and
that.

00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:35.080
I should say bah," all that bouncing around
all day.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.419
It's like you have anti virus software just
slowing down your, "Why is it so slow?"

00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:43.350
It's like yeah because you're thinking about
these stupid grudges that you're holding against

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.070
people for trivial bullshit.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.510
Like who cares if the guy at Starbucks bought
the last of cashews you idiot.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.370
Tom: Sounds deeply troubling.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.620
Tim: Yeah like, "Ferriss pull it together."

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.270
If I get it on paper though I'm like okay
I've dealt with that.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.539
Tom: Now in the book you encourage people
to bounce around.

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:02.270
What's one thing that you hope nobody skips?

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.620
Tim: The book's broken into three sections.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.480
You have healthy, wealthy, and wise which
is a nod to Ben Franklin.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.220
I mean they're all interdependent, right,
because they're sort of the three legs of

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.220
the stool.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.350
Healthy, wealthy, and wise.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.730
I do think you need all three.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:26.850
Derek Sivers is this programmer monk philosopher
king start up entrepreneur who started CD

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:33.460
Baby, which was the largest marketplace for
independent musicians at the time.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.399
Sold it for I think 24 million dollars but
he and Seth Godin I think are two examples

00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:44.920
of people who are very good at genuinely in
real life following contrarian rules that

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.250
work exceptionally well.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:52.740
Derek has a couple of one liners that I think
are really fantastic.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.480
I'll give you a few.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:01.559
One is, "If more information were the answer,
we'd all be billionaires with six pack abs."

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:02.590
That's a good one.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.830
Tom: Yeah.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:09.490
Tim: Just absorbing, not even absorbing, just
reading and watching and listening to more

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.830
isn't enough.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.830
You have to apply it.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.720
You have to use incentives.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.990
You have to have rewards and punishments set
for yourself so you actually get things done,

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.549
timelines, et cetera.

00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:20.549
That's one.

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:25.570
Another one is, "Don't be a donkey."

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.019
He says that to himself all the time.

00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:31.049
"Don't be a donkey, don't be a donkey," and
the reason is there's a, I want to say, it

00:33:31.049 --> 00:33:34.220
might be a philosopher's paradox but I don't
think it is.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.909
I think it's just a parable about burdens
ass.

00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:40.450
Burdens ass, about a donkey-
Tom: Good name.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.929
Tim: Yeah, my favorite porn.

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:43.330
No that's not it.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:48.820
It's about a donkey ... Sorry, too much caffeine.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:55.289
It's about a donkey who is thirsty and hungry
and there's water on one side a few feet away

00:33:55.289 --> 00:34:03.799
and hay on the other and he can't decide rather
to do the hay first or the water, the hay

00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:07.240
or the water, and he dies of thirst at the
end of it.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.730
He couldn't do them sequentially.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.850
Tom: Right.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:16.129
Tim: This is Derek's recommendation to his
younger self and really to any 20 or 30 something

00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:23.260
but it applies to everybody, which is in effect
you can do almost everything you want in life

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.429
but you can't do it at the same time and if
you can just dedicate yourself to one thing

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:34.080
for even a year and then the next thing for
a year you can do those 10 things but if you

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.310
try to do all 10 at once you're gonna be burdens
ass.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.649
"Should I do this or should I do this or should
I focus on this or should I focus on this?"

00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:42.410
Don't be a donkey.

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:49.119
The other one that, for me, was so helpful
to hear is I think he calls it, it's like

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.480
95 versus 100%.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:59.770
He tells this story of moving to around Santa
Monica and his friends getting him into biking

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.730
on the bike path, so up and down the boardwalk
right on the water.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:11.839
And so being a type A personality he would
get a stop watch and he'd start it and he'd

00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:16.930
huff and puff and race as hard as he could
all the way down to wherever and he would

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:21.520
time himself and everyday, no matter how hard
he did it, 43 minutes.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.390
43 minutes, just wouldn't improve.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.390
43 minutes.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:29.570
And this thing that should've been enjoyable
became painful in his mind.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.220
He started to avoid it.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.550
He'd be like, "Ah, there's other things to
do.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:37.469
No instead of bike riding I'll do this other
thing," and he realized at one point, "This

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:41.780
is really pathetic and this is really bad
that something that should be enjoyable I

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.880
am avoiding because I've made it so painful.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.270
I said why don't I just go for a bike ride
and enjoy it?"

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.589
He goes for a bike ride and it's just a leisurely
cruise.

00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:56.040
He's chilling, he's riding around and he's
seeing dolphins in the water.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.250
He's standing up, looking around, noticing
things he hadn't noticed before.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.490
At one point, this is Derek, he goes, "At
one point I looked up in the sky and there

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.520
was a pelican and I said wow pelican and it
shit in my mouth."

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.540
I was like, "Ahh."

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.570
He was like, "It was the best bike ride ever."

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.170
I was like, "Okay."

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:18.450
He's having a great time, pelican shit in
the mouth not withstanding and he gets back

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:23.850
and he looks at his watch and I think it was
45 minutes.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.709
And he's like, "Wait, what?"

00:36:25.709 --> 00:36:35.490
All that huffing and puffing, all that sweating
and leg cramps and pain was for an extra two

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.220
minutes off the clock?

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.980
That's outrageous.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.721
He started applying that to his entire life.

00:36:41.721 --> 00:36:44.090
He's like when it starts to get ... Now look.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:48.310
There are exceptions to all of this but he
said, "When I start to get really stressed

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:55.580
out I just stop because I realize 95% is enough
for getting almost all the results that I

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.770
want and making it sustainable," and this
comes back to the creativity right?

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:06.130
It's like if you always try to crank 100%,
you're like, "I need to get 2,000 awesome

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.260
words out today," that's like trying to hit
43 minutes every time and huffing and puffing.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.260
Tom: Right.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.349
Tim: And you're gonna start putting things
off.

00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:13.609
"Oh I need another cup of coffee.

00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:15.570
Oh my god my shoes are so dirty.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.570
I need to fix my shoes before I can go out
and write."

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:18.570
Tom: Possibly let that stand.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.230
Tim: And you'll do anything to put it off
because it becomes this intimidating task.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.780
So yeah, sort of the 95 versus 100% is another
one.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.490
Oh I've got another one, I have to share.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:28.490
Tom: Please.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.410
Tim: This is one of my favorites.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.130
Shaun White ... Two things that are very interesting
about Shaun White.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.690
Well there are a lot of things but he holds
the all-time record for medals at the X Games.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:44.180
He has, I think, two gold medals at the Olympics
and two things worth nothing for him and this

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.770
comes back to the high expectations thing.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:53.080
I asked him, "What is your self talk when
you come out of the gate for a gold medal

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.390
run at the Olympics?

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.579
What do you say to yourself?"

00:37:57.579 --> 00:38:01.250
He thought about it and the short version
is who cares.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.579
The short version is, "Who cares, I think
this is a really big deal.

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:10.660
Snowboarding, going down snow on this contraption
but at the end of the day I'm gonna go home,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.380
I'll see my family," which he borrowed from
Agassi.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:20.440
When Agassi sort of had his comeback that
was how he took the pressure off in very,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.270
very high pressure situations was to say,
"Who cares?"

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:24.470
Which is effective when you put in the training.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.400
If you put in the training you don't need
to stress in that last minute.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:33.420
The other thing I took away from Shaun is
when he has a really serious goal, like a

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:39.620
gold medal at Sochi or whatever it might be,
he also has a completely absurd goal to offset

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.810
how stress inducing that can be.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:47.230
At one point it was, "I want to wear American
flag pants on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine."

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.460
That was the other goal.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.109
He has some ludicrous goal to offset the serious
stuff.

00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:55.220
Tom: Wow that's cool.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.450
Tim: I've started trying to incorporate that
in my life.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.099
[crosstalk 00:38:58]
Tom: What's an absurd goal that you have right

00:39:00.099 --> 00:39:01.099
now?

00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:03.150
Tim: Okay, so this is an exclusive.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.410
This is breaking news.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.680
Tom: Here we go.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.089
Tim: And we'll see where it goes.

00:39:09.089 --> 00:39:14.050
I'm a little hesitant to even share this but
I'll give a teaser, I'll give a teaser which

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.170
is sufficient.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:19.740
Goal, I want this book to be everywhere.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.780
I want everyone to read this.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.730
Like a friend of mine said, "I bought 4-hour
Workweek for a few people who really needed

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.690
it for changing chapters in their lives or
starting a company.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.820
I've given 4-hour Body to people who want
to lose weight.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.150
This one I would give to everybody."

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.730
I have very big goals for this.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:41.890
I have some other plans, which I can't go
into huge detail with right now, but to create

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.320
a fragrance for men.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320
Tom: Really?

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.790
Tim: And I mean fucking look at me.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.670
I'm from Long Island.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.700
This is like a tuxedo for me.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.520
Don't really wear cologne or anything.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:01.060
Occasionally smell like I've been chased by
hyenas or something if I'm sweating a lot

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.010
but I was like how funny would it be if I
came out with a Tim Ferriss fragrance?

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.010
Oh my god.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.010
Tom: That would be amazing.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.830
Tim: How hilarious would that be?

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.160
Tom: What would Tim Ferriss smell like?

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.390
Tim: That I can't disclose but I do-
Tom: Oaky?

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.860
Tim: Oaky, like tequila.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.119
I think it'd be like a rough night.

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:23.230
[crosstalk 00:40:22]
Tom: That could be the name.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.470
Tim: Yeah, tequila and pine needles.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.030
It's like what happened?

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.880
Tom: Tim Ferriss: A Rough Night.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:35.510
Tim: Yeah, that's right and it'd be like a
rough night by Tim Ferriss.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.230
I want to have the cheesiest advertisements.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:46.280
You know, like the unbuttoned dress shirt
with the fancy watch looking like Blue Steel.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:51.390
I just want to make it as ludicrous as possible
but it will actually be ... I'm talking to

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.720
some of the best of the best people in that
world right now.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.720
Tom: Wow.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:00.681
Tim: It's like one part complete spinal tap
and then one part serious I actually want

00:41:00.681 --> 00:41:06.560
to make something cool but that to me is just
a psychological release valve so that when

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.130
I'm getting really wound up about this for
whatever reason, I can think about that.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.250
It just makes me laugh my ass off.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.750
When I have two glasses of wine, I chill out.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:21.960
Always pairing one serious with one absurd
goal I think is brilliant.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.260
It's so smart.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.920
I've been doing that since he first told me
about it and it's really improved the quality

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.260
of my life and my results.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.950
I also don't feel like I have all my eggs
in one basket.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:37.099
I'm diversifying my identity in a way, which
I think is very important.

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:40.200
Tom: All right, last question.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.520
What is the impact that you want to have on
the world?

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:51.980
Tim: The impact that I want to have on the
world right now would be creating a benevolent

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:59.400
army of super learners who test the impossibles
and teach other people to do the same.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.369
That's it, so whether it's 100,000, a million,
people who have mastered meta learning acquiring

00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:12.210
skills who are also willing to test the impossibles,
test the assumptions, and have the uncomfortable

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:18.220
conversations that I think this country is
largely dodging, that gets me all excited

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.690
and if they're able to then impart that to
more people.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:26.990
My goal is to make me obsolete as quickly
as possible.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.780
I think the goal of any really good personal
trainer should be to make themselves obsolete

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.680
and unnecessary as quickly as possible.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680
That's my goal.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.040
Tom: That's awesome man.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.730
Tim, thank you so much for coming in the show.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.730
Tim: Yeah thank you.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:40.730
Thanks for having me.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:41.730
Tom: Absolutely.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:47.500
Guys, you are going to want to get this book
talking about the toolkit to build that army

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.000
of super learners who are out there, actually
making an impact in the world.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.850
I have a feeling that this is gonna be the
book, I'm not kidding when I say that I have

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.670
not been this excited to read a book in a
very, very long time.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.950
It's the kind of book where you're gonna go
in and no matter what it is that you're facing

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:06.099
right now in your life, whether it's in healthy,
wealthy, or wise categories, there's gonna

00:43:06.099 --> 00:43:09.490
be something there from somebody who's living
it.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:12.470
They've done the kind of thing that you want
to do and they're giving you the real world

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:18.051
advice from right there, that minute in their
life which is incredibly exciting and there's

00:43:18.051 --> 00:43:19.660
two things about it that I like.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.119
One, the elements that they give you are very
punchy.

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:23.119
They're short.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.119
They're succinct.

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:25.119
It's easy to remember.

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.119
The good shit sticks.

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:29.460
It's gonna be a lot of stuff that really sticks
and will resonate with you, will echo through

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.079
your own mind, but he also allows them to
give their own context.

00:43:33.079 --> 00:43:37.280
It's not word in the abstract, it's actually,
take Jamie Foxx for instance.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.170
It's not just Jamie's quote about how there's
nothing beyond fear, it's actually explaining

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.420
what that means and being able to put it in
the context real world for him at that moment

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.210
and getting that allows these phrases to have
depth.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:57.730
I can't tell you how obsessively I collect
those codified nuggets of wisdom.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.530
My Evernote is bogged down.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.240
I swear my iPhone is actually heavier from
the number of those kind of nuggets that I've

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.119
collected and if you look at this tome, it
comes with the promise of that kind of stuff

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.119
in it.

00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:10.800
If you're like me and you've read everything
that this man has written, you've listened

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.690
to all the podcasts, you know he is not for
play and what he delivers always is usable

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.110
and that usability is my obsession.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.680
Join me in getting that copy.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.069
I'm gonna be buying an absurd number in the
name of Impact Theory and we're gonna be doing

00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:27.880
some kind of big giveaway.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.210
Yeah, if you haven't already read it go out
and get it.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.359

00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:33.710

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:37.130
Tim: Thank you.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.130
Tom: It is a pleasure.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.319
And of course Tim, we have to ask though.

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:43.319
Tim: Yeah.

00:44:43.319 --> 00:44:44.609
Tom: Where can they find you online?

00:44:44.609 --> 00:44:47.810
Tim: They can find me just about everywhere.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:52.520

two S's at Twitter.
