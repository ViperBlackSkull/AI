00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the approach now is
 

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.670 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the approach now is
always<00:12:20.490><c> thinking</c><00:12:21.420><c> of</c><00:12:21.690><c> new</c><00:12:21.720><c> ways</c><00:12:22.140><c> to</c><00:12:22.170><c> do</c><00:12:22.650><c> things</c>
