i was
 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.910 align:start position:0%
i was
in<00:00:12.080><c> shock</c><00:00:12.639><c> it</c><00:00:12.800><c> felt</c><00:00:13.200><c> unbelievably</c>

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
in shock it felt unbelievably
 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.109 align:start position:0%
in shock it felt unbelievably
efficient<00:00:15.920><c> it</c><00:00:16.000><c> probably</c><00:00:16.320><c> was</c>

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
efficient it probably was
 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.029 align:start position:0%
efficient it probably was
because<00:00:17.359><c> we</c><00:00:17.440><c> lose</c><00:00:17.680><c> so</c><00:00:17.840><c> much</c><00:00:18.160><c> time</c><00:00:18.480><c> every</c><00:00:18.720><c> time</c>

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
because we lose so much time every time
 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.429 align:start position:0%
because we lose so much time every time
we<00:00:19.279><c> are</c><00:00:19.840><c> looking</c><00:00:20.080><c> at</c><00:00:20.240><c> a</c><00:00:20.320><c> notification</c><00:00:21.199><c> and</c>

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
we are looking at a notification and
 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.550 align:start position:0%

then you have to get back to what you
are<00:00:22.640><c> doing</c><00:00:22.800><c> and</c><00:00:22.960><c> then</c><00:00:23.039><c> by</c><00:00:23.199><c> the</c><00:00:23.279><c> time</c><00:00:23.439><c> you're</c>

end of the day that is that is great um
 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.030 align:start position:0%
end of the day that is that is great um
i<00:00:31.679><c> a</c><00:00:31.760><c> lot</c><00:00:31.920><c> of</c><00:00:32.000><c> people</c><00:00:32.239><c> can't</c><00:00:32.480><c> quite</c><00:00:32.640><c> do</c><00:00:32.800><c> that</c>

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
i a lot of people can't quite do that
 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.229 align:start position:0%
i a lot of people can't quite do that
and<00:00:33.120><c> so</c><00:00:33.280><c> then</c><00:00:33.440><c> if</c><00:00:33.520><c> they</c><00:00:33.600><c> think</c><00:00:33.760><c> that's</c><00:00:34.079><c> the</c>

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
and so then if they think that's the
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.389 align:start position:0%
and so then if they think that's the

yeah<00:28:08.000><c> that</c><00:28:08.159><c> makes</c><00:28:08.640><c> a</c><00:28:09.039><c> lot</c><00:28:09.360><c> of</c><00:28:09.600><c> sense</c>

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that makes a lot of sense
 

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
yeah that makes a lot of sense
one<00:28:11.440><c> thing</c><00:28:11.679><c> that</c><00:28:11.840><c> i</c><00:28:12.000><c> found</c><00:28:12.399><c> for</c><00:28:12.559><c> me</c><00:28:12.799><c> that's</c>

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
one thing that i found for me that's
 

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
one thing that i found for me that's
really<00:28:13.279><c> been</c><00:28:13.440><c> extraordinary</c><00:28:14.000><c> and</c><00:28:14.080><c> i</c><00:28:14.240><c> just</c><00:28:14.480><c> did</c>

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
really been extraordinary and i just did
 

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.029 align:start position:0%
really been extraordinary and i just did
yesterday<00:28:15.600><c> an</c><00:28:15.760><c> experiment</c><00:28:16.159><c> with</c><00:28:16.320><c> this</c><00:28:16.559><c> and</c><00:28:16.720><c> i</c>

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday an experiment with this and i
 

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.389 align:start position:0%
yesterday an experiment with this and i
think<00:28:17.279><c> it's</c><00:28:17.520><c> going</c><00:28:17.679><c> to</c><00:28:17.760><c> work</c><00:28:18.000><c> it's</c><00:28:18.080><c> a</c><00:28:18.159><c> little</c>

00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
think it's going to work it's a little
 

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:20.070 align:start position:0%
think it's going to work it's a little
too<00:28:18.559><c> early</c><00:28:18.880><c> but</c><00:28:19.039><c> i</c><00:28:19.120><c> have</c><00:28:19.360><c> huge</c><00:28:19.600><c> switching</c>

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
too early but i have huge switching
 

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
too early but i have huge switching
costs<00:28:20.399><c> and</c><00:28:20.480><c> so</c><00:28:21.039><c> um</c><00:28:21.480><c> historically</c><00:28:22.559><c> until</c>

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
costs and so um historically until
 

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
costs and so um historically until
yesterday<00:28:24.080><c> i</c><00:28:24.880><c> would</c><00:28:25.440><c> check</c><00:28:25.679><c> my</c><00:28:25.840><c> phone</c>

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday i would check my phone
 

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.430 align:start position:0%
yesterday i would check my phone
routinely<00:28:26.559><c> because</c><00:28:26.720><c> if</c><00:28:26.880><c> somebody</c><00:28:27.200><c> had</c><00:28:27.360><c> a</c>

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
routinely because if somebody had a
 

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.549 align:start position:0%
routinely because if somebody had a

00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%

00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
got back to them quickly so i just felt
 

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
got back to them quickly so i just felt

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
like 5 p.m or something and then i
 

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
like 5 p.m or something and then i
started<00:28:55.279><c> getting</c><00:28:55.440><c> back</c><00:28:55.600><c> to</c><00:28:55.679><c> people</c><00:28:55.919><c> and</c>

started getting back to people and
 

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
started getting back to people and
responding<00:28:56.399><c> to</c><00:28:56.399><c> a</c><00:28:56.480><c> text</c><00:28:56.640><c> message</c><00:28:57.279><c> it</c><00:28:57.440><c> felt</c>

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
responding to a text message it felt
 

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.630 align:start position:0%
responding to a text message it felt

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
unbelievably efficient
 

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.830 align:start position:0%
unbelievably efficient
it<00:29:00.720><c> probably</c><00:29:01.039><c> was</c>

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
it probably was
 

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
it probably was
because<00:29:02.080><c> we</c><00:29:02.240><c> lose</c><00:29:02.480><c> so</c><00:29:02.640><c> much</c><00:29:02.880><c> time</c><00:29:03.200><c> every</c><00:29:03.440><c> time</c>

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
because we lose so much time every time
 

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.149 align:start position:0%
because we lose so much time every time
we<00:29:04.000><c> are</c><00:29:04.559><c> looking</c><00:29:04.799><c> at</c><00:29:04.960><c> a</c><00:29:05.039><c> notification</c><00:29:05.919><c> and</c>

00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
we are looking at a notification and
 

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
we are looking at a notification and
then<00:29:06.320><c> you</c><00:29:06.399><c> have</c><00:29:06.480><c> to</c><00:29:06.559><c> get</c><00:29:06.720><c> back</c><00:29:06.880><c> to</c><00:29:07.039><c> what</c><00:29:07.120><c> you're</c>

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
then you have to get back to what you're
 

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
then you have to get back to what you're
doing<00:29:07.600><c> and</c><00:29:07.679><c> then</c><00:29:07.760><c> by</c><00:29:07.919><c> the</c><00:29:08.000><c> time</c><00:29:08.159><c> you're</c><00:29:08.320><c> back</c>

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
doing and then by the time you're back
 

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.350 align:start position:0%
doing and then by the time you're back
in<00:29:08.559><c> what</c><00:29:08.640><c> you're</c><00:29:08.799><c> doing</c><00:29:08.960><c> there's</c><00:29:09.120><c> another</c>

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
in what you're doing there's another

in what you're doing there's another

so you know and if you can go till the
 

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
so you know and if you can go till the

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
end of the day that is that is great um
 

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
end of the day that is that is great um
i<00:29:16.399><c> a</c><00:29:16.480><c> lot</c><00:29:16.640><c> of</c><00:29:16.720><c> people</c><00:29:16.960><c> can't</c><00:29:17.200><c> quite</c><00:29:17.360><c> do</c><00:29:17.520><c> that</c>

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
i a lot of people can't quite do that
 

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.950 align:start position:0%
i a lot of people can't quite do that
and<00:29:17.840><c> so</c><00:29:18.000><c> then</c><00:29:18.159><c> if</c><00:29:18.240><c> they</c><00:29:18.399><c> think</c><00:29:18.559><c> that's</c><00:29:18.799><c> the</c>

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so then if they think that's the
 

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
and so then if they think that's the
goal<00:29:19.279><c> they're</c><00:29:20.000><c> like</c><00:29:20.159><c> well</c><00:29:20.399><c> i</c><00:29:20.480><c> can't</c><00:29:20.640><c> even</c><00:29:20.799><c> try</c>

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
goal they're like well i can't even try
 

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
goal they're like well i can't even try
so<00:29:21.279><c> i'm</c><00:29:21.520><c> not</c><00:29:21.679><c> gonna</c><00:29:21.760><c> bother</c><00:29:22.159><c> but</c><00:29:22.559><c> you</c><00:29:22.720><c> can</c>

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm not gonna bother but you can
