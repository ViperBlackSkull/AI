00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
and it helps them um so yeah i think
 

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.029 align:start position:0%
and it helps them um so yeah i think
it's

00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
it's

yeah<00:32:06.480><c> i</c><00:32:06.640><c> have</c><00:32:06.960><c> a</c><00:32:07.760><c> theory</c><00:32:08.240><c> about</c><00:32:09.120><c> what</c><00:32:09.360><c> it</c><00:32:09.519><c> is</c>

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a theory about what it is
 

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a theory about what it is
that<00:32:10.159><c> makes</c><00:32:10.480><c> that</c><00:32:10.799><c> worthwhile</c><00:32:11.440><c> so</c><00:32:11.600><c> the</c><00:32:11.679><c> human</c>

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
that makes that worthwhile so the human
 

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.830 align:start position:0%
that makes that worthwhile so the human

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
so naseem taleb has this idea of
 

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.630 align:start position:0%
so naseem taleb has this idea of
