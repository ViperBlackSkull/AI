00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
the honest through line of you it's
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.170 align:start position:0%
the honest through line of you it's
powerful<00:03:14.290><c> because</c><00:03:14.650><c> when</c><00:03:15.100><c> someone</c><00:03:15.520><c> sees</c><00:03:15.880><c> you</c>

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 align:start position:0%
powerful because when someone sees you
 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
powerful because when someone sees you
in<00:03:16.450><c> a</c><00:03:16.600><c> way</c><00:03:16.750><c> that</c><00:03:17.050><c> you</c><00:03:17.170><c> don't</c><00:03:17.320><c> necessarily</c><00:03:17.410><c> see</c>

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 align:start position:0%
yourself you can start to see yourself
 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
yourself you can start to see yourself
that<00:03:21.400><c> way</c><00:03:21.550><c> so</c><00:03:22.170><c> that's</c><00:03:23.170><c> being</c><00:03:23.380><c> conceptually</c>

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
that way so that's being conceptually
 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.190 align:start position:0%
that way so that's being conceptually
right<00:03:24.580><c> then</c><00:03:24.820><c> like</c><00:03:24.970><c> 30</c><00:03:25.209><c> seconds</c><00:03:25.720><c> ago</c>

like I couldn't do my career and that at
 

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
like I couldn't do my career and that at
the<00:13:22.800><c> same</c><00:13:22.830><c> time</c><00:13:23.280><c> and</c><00:13:24.150><c> then</c><00:13:24.360><c> I</c><00:13:24.450><c> realized</c><00:13:24.660><c> I</c><00:13:24.960><c> made</c>

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:25.170 align:start position:0%
the same time and then I realized I made
 

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
the same time and then I realized I made
that<00:13:25.350><c> up</c><00:13:25.520><c> that</c><00:13:26.520><c> I</c><00:13:26.550><c> can't</c><00:13:26.910><c> do</c><00:13:27.120><c> those</c><00:13:27.270><c> at</c><00:13:27.480><c> the</c>

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:27.570 align:start position:0%
that up that I can't do those at the
 

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.870 align:start position:0%
that up that I can't do those at the
same<00:13:27.780><c> time</c><00:13:28.160><c> somewhere</c><00:13:29.160><c> along</c><00:13:29.340><c> the</c><00:13:29.520><c> line</c><00:13:29.700><c> and</c>

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
same time somewhere along the line and
 

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
same time somewhere along the line and
so<00:13:32.880><c> I</c><00:13:32.940><c> think</c><00:13:33.000><c> that's</c><00:13:33.390><c> like</c><00:13:33.540><c> that's</c><00:13:34.350><c> one</c><00:13:34.650><c> of</c><00:13:34.800><c> the</c>

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:34.890 align:start position:0%
so I think that's like that's one of the
 

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:40.820 align:start position:0%
so I think that's like that's one of the
things<00:13:35.180><c> I</c><00:13:36.180><c> have</c><00:13:37.170><c> a</c><00:13:37.230><c> more</c><00:13:38.600><c> gargantuan</c><00:13:39.600><c> goal</c><00:13:40.590><c> I'm</c>

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:40.830 align:start position:0%
things I have a more gargantuan goal I'm
 

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.730 align:start position:0%

working<00:13:41.250><c> on</c><00:13:41.370><c> now</c><00:13:41.700><c> it's</c><00:13:41.970><c> sort</c><00:13:42.210><c> of</c><00:13:42.240><c> like</c><00:13:42.740><c> so</c>

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
working on now it's sort of like so
 

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.270 align:start position:0%
