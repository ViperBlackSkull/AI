you know i'm worried right now and their
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.870 align:start position:0%
you know i'm worried right now and their
inner<00:05:57.520><c> intention</c><00:05:57.919><c> might</c><00:05:58.080><c> be</c><00:05:58.240><c> to</c><00:05:58.400><c> not</c><00:05:58.639><c> have</c>

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
inner intention might be to not have

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
conflict so then they're against that
 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.870 align:start position:0%
conflict so then they're against that
worry<00:06:01.199><c> and</c><00:06:01.280><c> they're</c><00:06:01.440><c> actually</c><00:06:01.840><c> scared</c>

then<00:06:34.720><c> bigger</c><00:06:35.039><c> results</c><00:06:35.440><c> usually</c><00:06:35.919><c> show</c><00:06:36.160><c> up</c><00:06:36.720><c> as</c><00:06:36.880><c> a</c>

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
then bigger results usually show up as a
 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.749 align:start position:0%
then bigger results usually show up as a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
being that space
 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.110 align:start position:0%
being that space
so<00:06:41.520><c> to</c><00:06:41.680><c> me</c><00:06:41.840><c> an</c><00:06:42.000><c> intention</c><00:06:42.400><c> is</c><00:06:42.560><c> way</c><00:06:42.800><c> bigger</c>

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
so to me an intention is way bigger
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.350 align:start position:0%
so to me an intention is way bigger
because<00:06:43.759><c> you</c><00:06:43.919><c> don't</c><00:06:44.240><c> know</c><00:06:44.639><c> what</c><00:06:44.800><c> the</c><00:06:44.960><c> results</c>
