00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
already on our page and so we just start
 

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.910 align:start position:0%
already on our page and so we just start

leading and we've never found them and i
 

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.910 align:start position:0%
leading and we've never found them and i
so<00:16:34.160><c> i</c><00:16:34.240><c> think</c><00:16:34.399><c> there's</c><00:16:34.639><c> a</c><00:16:34.880><c> finding</c><00:16:35.680><c> and</c><00:16:35.759><c> then</c>

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a finding and then
 

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a finding and then
these<00:16:36.560><c> give</c><00:16:36.720><c> me</c><00:16:36.800><c> a</c><00:16:36.880><c> little</c><00:16:37.040><c> more</c><00:16:37.279><c> detail</c><00:16:37.600><c> on</c>

reflection

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
reflection
 

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.710 align:start position:0%
reflection
turns<00:24:00.480><c> experience</c><00:24:01.120><c> into</c><00:24:01.440><c> insight</c>

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
turns experience into insight
 

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.630 align:start position:0%
turns experience into insight
so<00:24:02.880><c> how</c><00:24:02.960><c> do</c><00:24:03.039><c> we</c><00:24:03.120><c> get</c><00:24:03.279><c> good</c><00:24:03.440><c> at</c><00:24:03.600><c> that</c><00:24:04.320><c> well</c><00:24:04.480><c> we</c>

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
so how do we get good at that well we
 

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.630 align:start position:0%
so how do we get good at that well we
get<00:24:04.799><c> good</c><00:24:05.039><c> at</c><00:24:05.200><c> that</c><00:24:05.360><c> by</c><00:24:05.760><c> understanding</c><00:24:06.400><c> that</c>

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
get good at that by understanding that
 

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.789 align:start position:0%
get good at that by understanding that
experience<00:24:07.120><c> isn't</c><00:24:07.440><c> enough</c><00:24:07.919><c> the</c><00:24:08.159><c> point</c><00:24:08.400><c> being</c>

i think they just have followers and one
of<00:32:14.640><c> the</c><00:32:14.720><c> reasons</c><00:32:15.120><c> is</c><00:32:15.279><c> a</c><00:32:15.360><c> lot</c><00:32:15.440><c> of</c><00:32:15.519><c> leaders</c><00:32:15.840><c> don't</c>

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the reasons is a lot of leaders don't
 

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.509 align:start position:0%
of the reasons is a lot of leaders don't
really<00:32:16.240><c> want</c><00:32:16.480><c> other</c><00:32:16.640><c> leaders</c><00:32:17.039><c> leaders</c><00:32:17.440><c> are</c>

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
cats you know i mean they just don't
 

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.110 align:start position:0%
cats you know i mean they just don't
they<00:32:21.279><c> just</c><00:32:21.440><c> don't</c><00:32:21.679><c> naturally</c><00:32:22.240><c> fall</c><00:32:22.480><c> in</c><00:32:22.720><c> line</c>

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
they just don't naturally fall in line

00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
so so i i think that first of all most
 

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.750 align:start position:0%
so so i i think that first of all most
people<00:32:25.840><c> don't</c><00:32:26.000><c> really</c><00:32:26.320><c> develop</c><00:32:26.880><c> leaders</c>

the third thing i think that is just
 

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
the third thing i think that is just

overlooked consistently in developing
leaders

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
leaders
 

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.990 align:start position:0%
leaders
is<00:34:56.399><c> that</c><00:34:56.560><c> you</c><00:34:56.879><c> you</c><00:34:57.040><c> you've</c><00:34:57.280><c> got</c><00:34:57.440><c> to</c><00:34:57.599><c> empower</c>

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that you you you've got to empower
 

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.109 align:start position:0%
is that you you you've got to empower
them

00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
them
 

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
them
you<00:34:59.760><c> you</c><00:35:00.000><c> have</c><00:35:00.320><c> got</c><00:35:00.640><c> to</c>

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
you you have got to
 

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.870 align:start position:0%
you you have got to
let<00:35:03.119><c> them</c><00:35:03.280><c> run</c><00:35:03.440><c> the</c><00:35:03.599><c> ball</c>

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
let them run the ball
 

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.069 align:start position:0%
let them run the ball
because<00:35:05.119><c> the</c><00:35:05.280><c> only</c><00:35:05.440><c> way</c><00:35:05.599><c> you</c><00:35:05.760><c> learn</c>

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
because the only way you learn
 

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.750 align:start position:0%
because the only way you learn
leadership<00:35:06.560><c> is</c><00:35:06.720><c> by</c><00:35:06.880><c> practicing</c><00:35:07.359><c> leadership</c>

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
leadership is by practicing leadership
 

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.150 align:start position:0%
leadership is by practicing leadership
so<00:35:07.920><c> i</c><00:35:08.000><c> think</c><00:35:08.240><c> what</c><00:35:08.400><c> a</c><00:35:08.480><c> good</c><00:35:08.640><c> leader</c><00:35:08.960><c> does</c><00:35:09.680><c> is</c><00:35:09.839><c> he</c>

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i think what a good leader does is he
 

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.589 align:start position:0%
so i think what a good leader does is he
sets<00:35:10.480><c> the</c><00:35:10.960><c> or</c><00:35:11.200><c> she</c><00:35:11.440><c> sets</c><00:35:11.839><c> the</c><00:35:12.400><c> stage</c><00:35:13.280><c> for</c><00:35:13.440><c> a</c>
