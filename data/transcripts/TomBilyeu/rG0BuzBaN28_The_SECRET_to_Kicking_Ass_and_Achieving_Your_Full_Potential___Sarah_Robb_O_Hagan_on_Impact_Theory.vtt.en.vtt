succeeded so
 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.870 align:start position:0%
succeeded so
why<00:04:41.120><c> is</c><00:04:41.280><c> that</c><00:04:41.680><c> how</c><00:04:41.840><c> did</c><00:04:41.919><c> that</c><00:04:42.080><c> play</c><00:04:42.400><c> out</c><00:04:42.639><c> yeah</c>

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
why is that how did that play out yeah
 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.270 align:start position:0%
why is that how did that play out yeah
so<00:04:43.199><c> i</c><00:04:43.360><c> don't</c><00:04:43.680><c> know</c><00:04:44.000><c> if</c><00:04:44.160><c> it's</c><00:04:44.479><c> just</c>

way around because i think
 

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.870 align:start position:0%
way around because i think
i've<00:08:50.480><c> learned</c><00:08:50.800><c> along</c><00:08:51.040><c> the</c><00:08:51.200><c> way</c><00:08:51.600><c> that</c><00:08:52.399><c> when</c><00:08:52.640><c> you</c>

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
i've learned along the way that when you
 

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.350 align:start position:0%
i've learned along the way that when you
are<00:08:53.120><c> trying</c><00:08:53.680><c> to</c><00:08:53.920><c> be</c><00:08:54.160><c> something</c><00:08:54.560><c> you're</c><00:08:54.800><c> not</c>

are trying to be something you're not
 

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.949 align:start position:0%
are trying to be something you're not
that's<00:08:55.680><c> when</c><00:08:55.839><c> you</c><00:08:55.920><c> lose</c><00:08:56.160><c> your</c><00:08:56.320><c> confidence</c><00:08:56.880><c> and</c>

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
that's when you lose your confidence and
 

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
that's when you lose your confidence and
so<00:08:57.120><c> i've</c><00:08:57.279><c> almost</c><00:08:57.519><c> gone</c><00:08:57.839><c> this</c><00:08:58.080><c> completely</c>
