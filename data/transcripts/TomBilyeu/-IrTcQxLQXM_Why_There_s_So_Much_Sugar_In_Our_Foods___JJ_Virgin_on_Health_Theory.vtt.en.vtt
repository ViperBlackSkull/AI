00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
so when you change your gut microbiome
 

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
so when you change your gut microbiome
become<00:08:30.479><c> more</c><00:08:30.879><c> glucose</c><00:08:31.360><c> and</c><00:08:31.520><c> tolerance</c><00:08:31.919><c> so</c><00:08:32.080><c> now</c>

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
become more glucose and tolerance so now

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
so knowing that i had a next step was
 

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.310 align:start position:0%
so knowing that i had a next step was
one<00:32:10.720><c> of</c><00:32:10.799><c> those</c><00:32:10.960><c> things</c><00:32:11.200><c> that</c><00:32:11.360><c> just</c><00:32:11.600><c> was</c><00:32:12.080><c> good</c>

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
one of those things that just was good
 

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.870 align:start position:0%
one of those things that just was good
for<00:32:12.559><c> anxiety</c><00:32:13.360><c> all</c><00:32:13.440><c> right</c><00:32:13.760><c> so</c><00:32:14.000><c> i</c><00:32:14.080><c> think</c><00:32:14.559><c> in</c>

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
for anxiety all right so i think in
 

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.029 align:start position:0%
for anxiety all right so i think in
anything<00:32:15.279><c> when</c><00:32:15.440><c> we</c><00:32:15.600><c> have</c><00:32:15.679><c> a</c><00:32:15.760><c> big</c><00:32:16.080><c> vision</c>

anything when we have a big vision
 

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.549 align:start position:0%
anything when we have a big vision
you<00:32:17.200><c> just</c><00:32:17.360><c> have</c><00:32:17.519><c> to</c><00:32:17.600><c> know</c><00:32:17.760><c> what</c><00:32:17.840><c> the</c><00:32:17.919><c> next</c><00:32:18.159><c> step</c>

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
you just have to know what the next step
 

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:19.269 align:start position:0%
you just have to know what the next step
is

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
is
 

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:21.029 align:start position:0%
is
so<00:32:19.440><c> how</c><00:32:19.600><c> do</c><00:32:19.679><c> you</c><00:32:20.159><c> how</c><00:32:20.320><c> do</c><00:32:20.399><c> you</c><00:32:20.480><c> find</c><00:32:20.720><c> that</c><00:32:20.880><c> next</c>

00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you find that next
 

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:23.190 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you find that next
step<00:32:21.279><c> i</c><00:32:21.360><c> mean</c><00:32:21.440><c> this</c><00:32:21.600><c> goes</c><00:32:21.840><c> back</c><00:32:22.080><c> to</c>

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
step i mean this goes back to
 

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.950 align:start position:0%
step i mean this goes back to
part<00:32:23.360><c> of</c><00:32:23.519><c> my</c><00:32:23.679><c> obsession</c><00:32:24.159><c> in</c><00:32:24.240><c> life</c><00:32:24.559><c> because</c><00:32:24.799><c> it</c>

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
part of my obsession in life because it
 

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.269 align:start position:0%
part of my obsession in life because it
was<00:32:25.120><c> so</c><00:32:25.360><c> scary</c><00:32:25.760><c> for</c><00:32:25.919><c> me</c><00:32:26.159><c> in</c><00:32:26.240><c> my</c><00:32:26.399><c> early</c><00:32:26.720><c> 20s</c><00:32:27.120><c> i</c>

00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
was so scary for me in my early 20s i
 

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
was so scary for me in my early 20s i
did<00:32:27.519><c> not</c><00:32:27.679><c> know</c><00:32:27.919><c> how</c><00:32:28.080><c> to</c><00:32:28.159><c> turn</c><00:32:28.399><c> rocks</c><00:32:28.720><c> over</c><00:32:29.039><c> and</c>

did not know how to turn rocks over and
 

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.590 align:start position:0%
did not know how to turn rocks over and
i<00:32:29.600><c> certainly</c><00:32:30.080><c> didn't</c><00:32:30.480><c> think</c><00:32:30.880><c> that</c><00:32:31.039><c> the</c><00:32:31.279><c> answer</c>

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
i certainly didn't think that the answer
 

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.430 align:start position:0%
i certainly didn't think that the answer
was<00:32:31.840><c> just</c><00:32:32.240><c> keep</c><00:32:32.480><c> turning</c><00:32:32.799><c> rocks</c><00:32:33.039><c> over</c><00:32:33.200><c> until</c>

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
was just keep turning rocks over until
 

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
was just keep turning rocks over until

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
identify the next step you know what's
 

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.630 align:start position:0%
