00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
mistake again
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.449 align:start position:0%
mistake again
you<00:04:10.500><c> know</c><00:04:10.590><c> that</c><00:04:10.739><c> was</c><00:04:10.859><c> that</c><00:04:11.010><c> was</c><00:04:11.129><c> really</c><00:04:11.160><c> the</c>

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 align:start position:0%
you know that was that was really the
 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.729 align:start position:0%
you know that was that was really the
thought<00:04:11.669><c> process</c><00:04:12.150><c> and</c><00:04:12.359><c> I</c><00:04:12.569><c> wasn't</c><00:04:12.840><c> it</c><00:04:13.139><c> wasn't</c><00:04:13.560><c> a</c>

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
thought process and I wasn't it wasn't a
 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.830 align:start position:0%
thought process and I wasn't it wasn't a
matter<00:04:14.160><c> of</c><00:04:14.310><c> mortality</c><00:04:14.940><c> or</c><00:04:15.090><c> fear</c><00:04:15.419><c> it</c><00:04:15.540><c> was</c><00:04:15.660><c> just</c>

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
matter of mortality or fear it was just
 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.779 align:start position:0%
matter of mortality or fear it was just
more<00:04:15.989><c> like</c><00:04:16.169><c> and</c><00:04:16.380><c> I</c><00:04:16.829><c> guess</c><00:04:17.010><c> I</c><00:04:17.130><c> realized</c><00:04:17.340><c> at</c><00:04:17.760><c> that</c>

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 align:start position:0%
more like and I guess I realized at that
 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:18.409 align:start position:0%
more like and I guess I realized at that
moment

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 align:start position:0%
moment
 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.750 align:start position:0%
moment
why<00:04:18.570><c> didn't</c><00:04:18.870><c> I</c><00:04:19.139><c> really</c><00:04:19.979><c> realized</c><00:04:20.489><c> that</c><00:04:20.609><c> them</c>

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
why didn't I really realized that them
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.870 align:start position:0%
why didn't I really realized that them
but<00:04:20.969><c> I'd</c><00:04:21.090><c> realized</c><00:04:21.570><c> it</c><00:04:21.690><c> later</c><00:04:21.930><c> that</c><00:04:22.229><c> that</c><00:04:22.880><c> I</c>

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
but I'd realized it later that that I
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.290 align:start position:0%
but I'd realized it later that that I
wasn't<00:04:24.270><c> really</c><00:04:24.360><c> afraid</c><00:04:24.570><c> to</c><00:04:24.659><c> get</c><00:04:24.780><c> hurt</c>

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 align:start position:0%
probably would have tried to skate and
 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
probably would have tried to skate and

make go of it however I could but I
 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.149 align:start position:0%
make go of it however I could but I
don't<00:05:01.449><c> think</c><00:05:01.630><c> I</c><00:05:01.870><c> would</c><00:05:02.080><c> have</c><00:05:02.110><c> been</c><00:05:02.229><c> successful</c>

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
don't think I would have been successful

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.350 align:start position:0%
assess their injury or to take care of

it because I've been through so many and
I<00:07:30.450><c> think</c><00:07:30.660><c> it's</c><00:07:30.780><c> just</c><00:07:30.930><c> more</c><00:07:31.110><c> leading</c><00:07:31.560><c> by</c>

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's just more leading by

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:09.850 align:start position:0%
for the first time that my voice was a
 

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.070 align:start position:0%
for the first time that my voice was a

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
part of my identity and I'd never
 

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
part of my identity and I'd never
realized<00:27:11.320><c> it</c><00:27:11.680><c> and</c><00:27:12.040><c> so</c><00:27:12.250><c> suddenly</c><00:27:12.460><c> I</c><00:27:12.640><c> felt</c><00:27:12.880><c> like</c>

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.090 align:start position:0%
realized it and so suddenly I felt like
 

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
realized it and so suddenly I felt like
a<00:27:13.240><c> different</c><00:27:13.930><c> person</c><00:27:14.380><c> and</c><00:27:14.740><c> a</c><00:27:15.010><c> less</c><00:27:15.430><c> person</c><00:27:16.030><c> if</c>

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.210 align:start position:0%
a different person and a less person if
 

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.910 align:start position:0%
a different person and a less person if
I<00:27:16.420><c> wasn't</c><00:27:16.690><c> gonna</c><00:27:16.900><c> be</c><00:27:17.080><c> able</c><00:27:17.170><c> to</c><00:27:17.290><c> vocalize</c><00:27:17.500><c> and</c>

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
I wasn't gonna be able to vocalize and
 

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.950 align:start position:0%
I wasn't gonna be able to vocalize and
so<00:27:18.490><c> my</c><00:27:18.760><c> mind</c><00:27:18.910><c> just</c><00:27:19.120><c> starts</c><00:27:19.330><c> running</c><00:27:19.600><c> away</c><00:27:19.690><c> and</c>

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
so my mind just starts running away and
 

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.590 align:start position:0%
so my mind just starts running away and
I<00:27:20.020><c> started</c><00:27:20.230><c> thinking</c><00:27:20.500><c> like</c><00:27:20.880><c> not</c><00:27:21.880><c> only</c><00:27:22.090><c> Who</c><00:27:22.390><c> am</c>
