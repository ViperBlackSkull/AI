00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.430 align:start position:0%
engine and that's expensive it's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
complicated you have to have technical
 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.869 align:start position:0%
complicated you have to have technical
expertise<00:03:54.239><c> in</c><00:03:54.400><c> some</c><00:03:54.640><c> way</c><00:03:54.879><c> which</c><00:03:55.120><c> my</c><00:03:55.360><c> dad</c><00:03:55.680><c> had</c>

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 align:start position:0%
expertise in some way which my dad had
 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
expertise in some way which my dad had
um<00:03:57.280><c> so</c><00:03:57.439><c> i</c><00:03:57.519><c> think</c><00:03:57.760><c> you</c><00:03:57.920><c> have</c><00:03:58.000><c> to</c><00:03:58.080><c> have</c><00:03:58.239><c> the</c>

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
um so i think you have to have the
 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
um so i think you have to have the
exposure<00:03:58.959><c> and</c><00:03:59.040><c> then</c><00:03:59.200><c> you</c><00:03:59.280><c> have</c><00:03:59.360><c> to</c><00:03:59.519><c> think</c><00:03:59.760><c> of</c>

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
exposure and then you have to think of
 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.429 align:start position:0%
exposure and then you have to think of
it<00:04:00.080><c> you</c><00:04:00.159><c> know</c><00:04:00.319><c> it's</c><00:04:00.400><c> not</c><00:04:00.560><c> a</c><00:04:00.640><c> sport</c><00:04:00.959><c> in</c><00:04:01.040><c> school</c>

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
you have to have that really
 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.309 align:start position:0%
you have to have that really

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i believe fate based on

00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
fear jealousy and then above that middle
 

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.349 align:start position:0%
fear jealousy and then above that middle
threshold<00:35:50.160><c> uh</c><00:35:50.640><c> is</c>

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
threshold uh is
 

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:54.470 align:start position:0%
threshold uh is
love<00:35:52.000><c> and</c><00:35:52.720><c> you</c><00:35:52.880><c> know</c><00:35:53.119><c> generosity</c><00:35:54.160><c> and</c>

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
love and you know generosity and
 

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
love and you know generosity and
gratefulness<00:35:55.599><c> and</c><00:35:56.000><c> kindness</c><00:35:56.960><c> and</c><00:35:57.280><c> joy</c>

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
gratefulness and kindness and joy
 

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.109 align:start position:0%
gratefulness and kindness and joy
those<00:35:59.200><c> being</c><00:35:59.520><c> the</c><00:35:59.839><c> higher</c><00:36:00.240><c> frequency</c>

00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
those being the higher frequency
 

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.829 align:start position:0%
those being the higher frequency
energies<00:36:02.160><c> and</c><00:36:02.400><c> so</c><00:36:02.640><c> for</c><00:36:02.880><c> me</c><00:36:03.119><c> i</c><00:36:03.200><c> try</c><00:36:03.359><c> and</c><00:36:03.520><c> focus</c>

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
energies and so for me i try and focus
 

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:05.109 align:start position:0%
energies and so for me i try and focus
on<00:36:04.000><c> the</c><00:36:04.079><c> higher</c><00:36:04.400><c> ones</c><00:36:04.640><c> because</c><00:36:04.800><c> that's</c><00:36:04.960><c> what</c><00:36:05.040><c> i</c>

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
on the higher ones because that's what i
 

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
on the higher ones because that's what i
want<00:36:05.280><c> to</c><00:36:05.359><c> attract</c><00:36:05.839><c> more</c><00:36:06.079><c> of</c>

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
want to attract more of
 

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.109 align:start position:0%
want to attract more of
so<00:36:08.480><c> i</c><00:36:08.800><c> think</c><00:36:09.040><c> that</c><00:36:09.440><c> if</c><00:36:09.680><c> you</c><00:36:10.160><c> are</c><00:36:10.480><c> operating</c><00:36:11.040><c> in</c>

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that if you are operating in
 

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
so i think that if you are operating in
a<00:36:11.200><c> lower</c><00:36:11.520><c> vibrational</c><00:36:12.079><c> state</c><00:36:12.480><c> based</c><00:36:12.800><c> on</c><00:36:12.880><c> your</c>

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
a lower vibrational state based on your
