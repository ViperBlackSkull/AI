00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:01.809 align:start position:0%
down so we thought okay what is the
 

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:03.870 align:start position:0%
down so we thought okay what is the

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
worst-case scenario and the worst-case
 

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
worst-case scenario and the worst-case
