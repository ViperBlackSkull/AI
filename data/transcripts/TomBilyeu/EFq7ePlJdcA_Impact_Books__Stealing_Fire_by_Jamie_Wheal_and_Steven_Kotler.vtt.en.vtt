00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.070 align:start position:0%
like this the Ellie is um isn't
judgmental<00:17:36.799><c> basically</c><00:17:37.200><c> and</c><00:17:37.280><c> so</c><00:17:37.440><c> people</c><00:17:37.679><c> are</c>

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
judgmental basically and so people are
 

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.990 align:start position:0%
judgmental basically and so people are
are<00:17:38.640><c> way</c><00:17:38.840><c> more</c><00:17:39.039><c> willing</c><00:17:39.320><c> to</c><00:17:39.440><c> open</c><00:17:39.640><c> up</c><00:17:39.720><c> to</c><00:17:39.840><c> her</c>

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
are way more willing to open up to her
 

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
are way more willing to open up to her
and<00:17:40.080><c> then</c><00:17:40.200><c> the</c><00:17:40.320><c> second</c><00:17:40.520><c> part</c><00:17:40.640><c> of</c><00:17:40.760><c> the</c>

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then the second part of the
 

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.909 align:start position:0%
and then the second part of the
hypothesis<00:17:41.679><c> is</c><00:17:41.760><c> that</c><00:17:41.919><c> the</c><00:17:42.080><c> reason</c><00:17:42.400><c> that</c><00:17:42.559><c> Ellie</c>

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
hypothesis is that the reason that Ellie
 

00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:44.789 align:start position:0%
hypothesis is that the reason that Ellie
is<00:17:43.120><c> able</c><00:17:43.440><c> to</c>

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
is able to
 

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.710 align:start position:0%
is able to

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
um effectively connect with people if
 

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
um effectively connect with people if
that's<00:17:47.840><c> the</c><00:17:48.000><c> right</c><00:17:48.120><c> word</c><00:17:48.400><c> is</c><00:17:48.559><c> because</c><00:17:48.760><c> she's</c>

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's the right word is because she's
 

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
that's the right word is because she's
taking<00:17:49.240><c> in</c><00:17:49.440><c> not</c><00:17:49.600><c> just</c><00:17:49.760><c> what</c><00:17:49.840><c> you</c><00:17:49.960><c> say</c><00:17:50.160><c> but</c><00:17:50.280><c> your</c>

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
physical Behavior as well so she's
 

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.830 align:start position:0%

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the possibilities of um like go back to
 

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
the possibilities of um like go back to

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
spoken very eloquently about that but
 

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
spoken very eloquently about that but
he's<00:24:13.640><c> going</c><00:24:13.720><c> to</c><00:24:14.120><c> in</c><00:24:14.240><c> fact</c><00:24:14.600><c> you</c><00:24:14.840><c> this</c><00:24:14.919><c> is</c><00:24:15.039><c> what</c>

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
he's going to in fact you this is what
 

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.549 align:start position:0%
he's going to in fact you this is what
the<00:24:15.240><c> authors</c><00:24:15.520><c> say</c><00:24:15.799><c> don't</c><00:24:16.000><c> become</c><00:24:16.200><c> a</c><00:24:16.279><c> bliss</c>

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
the authors say don't become a bliss
 

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:19.510 align:start position:0%
the authors say don't become a bliss
junkie<00:24:17.559><c> um</c><00:24:18.039><c> and</c><00:24:18.159><c> so</c><00:24:18.360><c> here's</c><00:24:18.600><c> their</c><00:24:18.840><c> logic</c><00:24:19.159><c> for</c>

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
junkie um and so here's their logic for
 

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.310 align:start position:0%
junkie um and so here's their logic for
why<00:24:20.039><c> you</c><00:24:20.279><c> have</c><00:24:20.400><c> to</c><00:24:20.600><c> be</c><00:24:21.000><c> super</c><00:24:22.120><c> careful</c><00:24:23.120><c> with</c>

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
why you have to be super careful with
 

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.549 align:start position:0%
why you have to be super careful with
flow<00:24:23.840><c> and</c><00:24:24.000><c> not</c><00:24:24.120><c> just</c><00:24:24.279><c> talking</c><00:24:24.440><c> about</c>

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
flow and not just talking about
 

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.830 align:start position:0%
flow and not just talking about

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
psychedelics by the way with Even Flow
 

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.789 align:start position:0%
psychedelics by the way with Even Flow
so<00:24:27.159><c> here's</c><00:24:27.720><c> um</c><00:24:28.000><c> what</c><00:24:28.120><c> I</c><00:24:28.399><c> wrote</c><00:24:29.039><c> flow</c><00:24:29.399><c> is</c><00:24:29.559><c> like</c>

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
so here's um what I wrote flow is like
 

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:32.070 align:start position:0%
so here's um what I wrote flow is like
being<00:24:30.039><c> a</c><00:24:30.200><c> colander</c><00:24:30.760><c> this</c><00:24:30.840><c> is</c><00:24:31.080><c> their</c><00:24:31.399><c> example</c>
