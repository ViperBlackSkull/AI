00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
because you don't hold you hold dollar
 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.610 align:start position:0%
because you don't hold you hold dollar

it's<00:04:58.860><c> a</c><00:04:59.100><c> promise</c><00:04:59.400><c> to</c><00:04:59.639><c> really</c><00:04:59.820><c> receive</c>

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 align:start position:0%
it's a promise to really receive

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
so okay so now getting out of those
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.969 align:start position:0%
so okay so now getting out of those

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.450 align:start position:0%

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
to do for those countries and so that's
 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.830 align:start position:0%
to do for those countries and so that's
the<00:05:15.060><c> dynamic</c><00:05:15.660><c> that's</c><00:05:16.139><c> taking</c><00:05:16.860><c> place</c><00:05:17.419><c> so</c><00:05:18.419><c> it's</c>

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
the dynamic that's taking place so it's
 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.850 align:start position:0%
the dynamic that's taking place so it's
it's

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's
 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.909 align:start position:0%
