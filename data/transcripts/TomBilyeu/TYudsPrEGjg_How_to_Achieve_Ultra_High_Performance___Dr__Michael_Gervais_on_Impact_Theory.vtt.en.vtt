00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.110 align:start position:0%
of the brain so what's happening here is
 

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.110 align:start position:0%
of the brain so what's happening here is
you're<00:26:41.650><c> right</c><00:26:41.950><c> now</c><00:26:42.100><c> you're</c><00:26:42.370><c> gating</c><00:26:42.790><c> out</c><00:26:42.910><c> and</c>

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
you're right now you're gating out and
 

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
you're right now you're gating out and
I'm<00:26:43.210><c> gating</c><00:26:43.540><c> out</c><00:26:43.630><c> no</c><00:26:43.840><c> this</c><00:26:44.020><c> is</c><00:26:44.200><c> safe</c><00:26:44.320><c> nope</c>

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:44.590 align:start position:0%
I'm gating out no this is safe nope
 

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
I'm gating out no this is safe nope
we're<00:26:44.770><c> safe</c><00:26:45.010><c> no</c><00:26:45.130><c> we're</c><00:26:45.340><c> okay</c><00:26:45.550><c> this</c><00:26:45.760><c> is</c><00:26:45.880><c> okay</c>

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.150 align:start position:0%
we're safe no we're okay this is okay
 

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.070 align:start position:0%
we're safe no we're okay this is okay
this<00:26:46.510><c> is</c><00:26:46.690><c> okay</c>

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
this is okay
 

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.830 align:start position:0%
this is okay
and<00:26:47.320><c> so</c><00:26:48.010><c> our</c><00:26:48.310><c> brain</c><00:26:48.790><c> is</c><00:26:48.970><c> designed</c><00:26:49.150><c> to</c><00:26:49.510><c> figure</c>

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
and so our brain is designed to figure
 

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.630 align:start position:0%
and so our brain is designed to figure
out<00:26:49.960><c> if</c><00:26:50.170><c> we're</c><00:26:50.380><c> gonna</c><00:26:50.470><c> be</c><00:26:50.680><c> okay</c><00:26:50.980><c> and</c><00:26:51.100><c> safe</c><00:26:51.340><c> here</c>

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%

out if we're gonna be okay and safe here
that<00:26:51.970><c> came</c><00:26:52.180><c> from</c><00:26:52.210><c> saber-toothed</c><00:26:52.930><c> Tigers</c><00:26:53.200><c> that</c>

that came from saber-toothed Tigers that

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
came from the rustling and the bush is
 

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
came from the rustling and the bush is
it<00:26:55.390><c> a</c><00:26:55.450><c> saber-toothed</c><00:26:55.900><c> or</c><00:26:56.080><c> is</c><00:26:56.170><c> it</c><00:26:56.260><c> a</c><00:26:56.320><c> bunny</c><00:26:56.470><c> and</c>

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:56.710 align:start position:0%
it a saber-toothed or is it a bunny and
 

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
it a saber-toothed or is it a bunny and
so<00:26:57.550><c> we've</c><00:26:57.760><c> had</c><00:26:57.880><c> to</c><00:26:58.060><c> figure</c><00:26:58.420><c> out</c><00:26:58.600><c> how</c><00:26:58.960><c> to</c><00:26:58.990><c> be</c>

00:26:59.640 --> 00:26:59.650 align:start position:0%
so we've had to figure out how to be
 

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.190 align:start position:0%
so we've had to figure out how to be
hyper-vigilant<00:27:00.160><c> so</c><00:27:00.670><c> we</c><00:27:00.760><c> could</c><00:27:00.910><c> get</c><00:27:00.970><c> away</c><00:27:01.200><c> our</c>

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
