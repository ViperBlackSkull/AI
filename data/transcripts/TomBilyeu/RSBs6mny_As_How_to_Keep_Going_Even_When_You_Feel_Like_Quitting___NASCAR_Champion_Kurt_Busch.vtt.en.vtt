that's the preparation that
 

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
that's the preparation that
all<00:14:50.480><c> of</c><00:14:50.639><c> us</c><00:14:51.040><c> in</c><00:14:51.199><c> any</c><00:14:51.440><c> sport</c><00:14:51.920><c> go</c><00:14:52.160><c> through</c><00:14:52.800><c> that's</c>

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
all of us in any sport go through that's
 

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.110 align:start position:0%
all of us in any sport go through that's

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes is you work your way
 

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.710 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes is you work your way

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
towards the top you just don't start
 

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
towards the top you just don't start
there

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
there
 

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.310 align:start position:0%
there
so<00:14:58.079><c> preparations</c><00:14:58.720><c> come</c><00:14:58.959><c> up</c><00:14:59.120><c> a</c><00:14:59.199><c> few</c><00:14:59.440><c> times</c>

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
so preparations come up a few times
 

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.750 align:start position:0%
so preparations come up a few times
i'll<00:15:00.560><c> tie</c><00:15:00.720><c> it</c><00:15:00.800><c> to</c><00:15:00.880><c> intuition</c><00:15:01.279><c> tell</c><00:15:01.440><c> me</c><00:15:01.600><c> if</c><00:15:01.680><c> you</c>

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'll tie it to intuition tell me if you
 

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
i'll tie it to intuition tell me if you
