00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.830 align:start position:0%
what was that process like and then what
were<00:04:02.080><c> some</c><00:04:02.239><c> of</c><00:04:02.400><c> the</c><00:04:02.560><c> actual</c><00:04:02.959><c> real</c><00:04:03.280><c> mechanisms</c>

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
were some of the actual real mechanisms
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.509 align:start position:0%
were some of the actual real mechanisms
that<00:04:04.000><c> you</c><00:04:04.159><c> learned</c><00:04:04.400><c> that</c><00:04:04.560><c> you're</c><00:04:04.799><c> still</c><00:04:05.040><c> using</c>

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
that you learned that you're still using
 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.789 align:start position:0%
that you learned that you're still using
yeah<00:04:06.000><c> so</c><00:04:06.239><c> the</c><00:04:06.319><c> process</c><00:04:07.120><c> was</c><00:04:07.280><c> incredibly</c><00:04:07.920><c> long</c>

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so the process was incredibly long
 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.070 align:start position:0%
yeah so the process was incredibly long
because<00:04:09.599><c> just</c><00:04:10.319><c> stopping</c><00:04:11.040><c> using</c><00:04:11.519><c> drugs</c><00:04:11.920><c> is</c>
