00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
much a box there is a right way to be
 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.110 align:start position:0%
much a box there is a right way to be

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then there's everything else um and
 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.749 align:start position:0%
and then there's everything else um and
so<00:05:53.360><c> i'm</c><00:05:53.759><c> getting</c><00:05:54.080><c> that</c><00:05:54.240><c> he</c><00:05:54.800><c> obviously</c><00:05:55.360><c> chafed</c>

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
so like i think metabolizing that
 

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.669 align:start position:0%
so like i think metabolizing that
physically<00:33:16.640><c> was</c><00:33:16.880><c> like</c><00:33:17.279><c> i</c><00:33:17.360><c> went</c><00:33:17.519><c> through</c>

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
physically was like i went through

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
tune with what that looked like and then

00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
like deep meditation to almost where i
 

00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
like deep meditation to almost where i
was<00:34:04.080><c> like</c><00:34:04.240><c> a</c><00:34:04.320><c> trance-like</c><00:34:05.039><c> state</c><00:34:05.840><c> to</c><00:34:05.919><c> where</c><00:34:06.080><c> i</c>

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
was like a trance-like state to where i
 

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:08.550 align:start position:0%
was like a trance-like state to where i
was<00:34:06.320><c> able</c><00:34:06.480><c> to</c><00:34:06.799><c> to</c><00:34:07.039><c> maintain</c><00:34:07.519><c> a</c><00:34:07.679><c> threshold</c><00:34:08.320><c> that</c>

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
was able to to maintain a threshold that
 

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.829 align:start position:0%
was able to to maintain a threshold that
was<00:34:09.040><c> so</c><00:34:09.359><c> high</c><00:34:09.679><c> for</c><00:34:09.919><c> so</c><00:34:10.159><c> long</c><00:34:10.480><c> where</c><00:34:10.800><c> almost</c>

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
was so high for so long where almost
 

00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
was so high for so long where almost
basically<00:34:12.159><c> like</c><00:34:12.320><c> your</c><00:34:12.399><c> vo2</c><00:34:12.879><c> max</c><00:34:13.200><c> like</c><00:34:13.359><c> you</c>

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
basically like your vo2 max like you
 

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.270 align:start position:0%
basically like your vo2 max like you
should<00:34:13.679><c> basically</c><00:34:14.079><c> peak</c><00:34:14.320><c> and</c><00:34:14.399><c> then</c><00:34:14.639><c> fall</c>

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
should basically peak and then fall
 

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.869 align:start position:0%
should basically peak and then fall
right<00:34:16.000><c> um</c>

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
right um
 

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:18.310 align:start position:0%
right um
and<00:34:16.960><c> then</c><00:34:17.119><c> with</c><00:34:17.359><c> training</c><00:34:17.839><c> you're</c><00:34:18.079><c> able</c><00:34:18.240><c> to</c>

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
and then with training you're able to
 

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
and then with training you're able to
kind<00:34:18.480><c> of</c><00:34:18.639><c> peak</c><00:34:18.879><c> and</c><00:34:18.960><c> then</c><00:34:19.119><c> sustain</c><00:34:19.599><c> this</c><00:34:19.760><c> peak</c>

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of peak and then sustain this peak
 

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.389 align:start position:0%
kind of peak and then sustain this peak
for<00:34:20.159><c> like</c><00:34:20.320><c> a</c><00:34:20.480><c> weird</c><00:34:21.200><c> un</c><00:34:21.599><c> like</c><00:34:21.839><c> a</c><00:34:22.000><c> weird</c><00:34:22.240><c> like</c>
