00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
the threshold event yeah so around 60s I
 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.940 align:start position:0%
the threshold event yeah so around 60s I
grew<00:03:41.760><c> up</c><00:03:41.880><c> very</c><00:03:41.940><c> skinny</c><00:03:42.540><c> and</c><00:03:42.780><c> so</c><00:03:43.230><c> my</c><00:03:43.620><c> entire</c>

weakness and so even my team I hid it
 

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
weakness and so even my team I hid it

because I didn't want them to think that
 

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.540 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want them to think that

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
remember thinking at the time which
again<00:18:54.120><c> like</c><00:18:54.570><c> the</c><00:18:55.110><c> myth</c><00:18:55.350><c> is</c><00:18:55.620><c> like</c><00:18:56.220><c> the</c><00:18:56.460><c> more</c>

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
again like the myth is like the more

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:58.590 align:start position:0%
money you pay the better the doctor and
 

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
money you pay the better the doctor and
so<00:18:58.800><c> every</c><00:18:59.190><c> time</c><00:18:59.220><c> it</c><00:18:59.850><c> was</c><00:19:00.030><c> a</c><00:19:00.090><c> disappointment</c>

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:00.810 align:start position:0%

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:22.460 align:start position:0%
people may share them but like we tried
 

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.099 align:start position:0%
people may share them but like we tried
the<00:36:22.579><c> fodmap</c><00:36:22.970><c> fob</c><00:36:23.180><c> map</c><00:36:23.420><c> didn't</c><00:36:23.750><c> work</c><00:36:23.869><c> for</c><00:36:24.050><c> you</c>

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:24.109 align:start position:0%
the fodmap fob map didn't work for you
 

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:26.589 align:start position:0%
the fodmap fob map didn't work for you
just<00:36:24.530><c> adhering</c><00:36:25.040><c> to</c><00:36:25.069><c> that</c><00:36:25.160><c> now</c><00:36:25.549><c> we</c><00:36:26.089><c> found</c><00:36:26.359><c> that</c>

00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
just adhering to that now we found that
 

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:28.539 align:start position:0%
just adhering to that now we found that
there<00:36:26.780><c> were</c><00:36:27.020><c> items</c><00:36:27.559><c> on</c><00:36:27.740><c> the</c><00:36:27.920><c> fodmap</c><00:36:28.309><c> that</c><00:36:28.460><c> were</c>

00:36:28.539 --> 00:36:28.549 align:start position:0%
there were items on the fodmap that were

there were items on the fodmap that were

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:30.260 align:start position:0%

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.589 align:start position:0%

00:36:36.099 --> 00:36:36.109 align:start position:0%
with this but it isn't for everybody and
 

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:38.380 align:start position:0%
with this but it isn't for everybody and
so<00:36:36.260><c> you</c><00:36:36.319><c> really</c><00:36:36.829><c> do</c><00:36:36.980><c> have</c><00:36:37.010><c> to</c><00:36:37.309><c> own</c><00:36:37.490><c> going</c>

00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:07.579 align:start position:0%
that I'm doing I'm like this is a theory
 

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:09.130 align:start position:0%
that I'm doing I'm like this is a theory
which<00:39:07.819><c> is</c><00:39:07.940><c> why</c><00:39:08.030><c> we</c><00:39:08.150><c> could</c><00:39:08.359><c> the</c><00:39:08.510><c> show</c><00:39:08.660><c> healthier</c>

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.140 align:start position:0%
which is why we could the show healthier
 

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.609 align:start position:0%
which is why we could the show healthier
we<00:39:09.500><c> had</c><00:39:09.680><c> such</c><00:39:10.010><c> a</c><00:39:10.040><c> strong</c><00:39:10.490><c> idea</c><00:39:10.790><c> of</c><00:39:11.240><c> what</c><00:39:12.020><c> it</c><00:39:12.319><c> was</c>

00:39:12.609 --> 00:39:12.619 align:start position:0%
we had such a strong idea of what it was
 

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:14.380 align:start position:0%
we had such a strong idea of what it was
that<00:39:12.890><c> there's</c><00:39:13.069><c> no</c><00:39:13.130><c> way</c><00:39:13.460><c> it</c><00:39:13.579><c> could</c><00:39:13.730><c> be</c><00:39:13.760><c> this</c><00:39:14.150><c> and</c>

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
that there's no way it could be this and
 

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.510 align:start position:0%
that there's no way it could be this and
when<00:39:14.960><c> we</c><00:39:14.990><c> started</c><00:39:15.470><c> the</c><00:39:15.589><c> show</c><00:39:15.619><c> is</c><00:39:15.859><c> because</c><00:39:16.280><c> you</c>

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
when we started the show is because you
 

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.270 align:start position:0%
when we started the show is because you
were<00:39:16.640><c> learning</c><00:39:17.030><c> so</c><00:39:17.390><c> much</c><00:39:17.660><c> that</c><00:39:18.319><c> had</c><00:39:18.589><c> started</c>

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
were learning so much that had started
 

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.609 align:start position:0%
were learning so much that had started
to<00:39:19.579><c> rebut</c><00:39:20.510><c> the</c><00:39:20.630><c> things</c><00:39:20.839><c> that</c><00:39:20.960><c> we</c><00:39:21.049><c> believed</c><00:39:21.380><c> in</c>

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:21.619 align:start position:0%
to rebut the things that we believed in
 

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:23.740 align:start position:0%
to rebut the things that we believed in
so<00:39:22.160><c> then</c><00:39:22.369><c> it's</c><00:39:22.579><c> like</c><00:39:22.700><c> okay</c><00:39:23.000><c> well</c><00:39:23.150><c> our</c><00:39:23.329><c> beliefs</c>

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
so then it's like okay well our beliefs
 

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:26.109 align:start position:0%
so then it's like okay well our beliefs
right<00:39:23.960><c> now</c><00:39:24.109><c> are</c><00:39:24.230><c> holding</c><00:39:24.589><c> us</c><00:39:24.710><c> back</c><00:39:24.799><c> and</c><00:39:25.250><c> so</c><00:39:25.849><c> why</c>

00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
right now are holding us back and so why
 

00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
right now are holding us back and so why

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:53.780 align:start position:0%
but it's just gonna it's a theory so

because it's fermenting it generates a
