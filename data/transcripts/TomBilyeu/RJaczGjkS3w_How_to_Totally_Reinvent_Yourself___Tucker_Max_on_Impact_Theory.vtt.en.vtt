00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
about this stuff I just I recognise the
 

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
about this stuff I just I recognise the
anxiety<00:32:11.080><c> I</c><00:32:11.260><c> accepted</c><00:32:12.250><c> it</c><00:32:12.400><c> and</c><00:32:12.850><c> then</c><00:32:13.780><c> actually</c>

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.230 align:start position:0%
anxiety I accepted it and then actually
another<00:32:15.040><c> technique</c><00:32:15.370><c> I</c><00:32:15.520><c> use</c><00:32:15.669><c> that</c><00:32:15.820><c> reframe</c><00:32:16.210><c> it</c>

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
another technique I use that reframe it
 

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.270 align:start position:0%
another technique I use that reframe it
is<00:32:16.510><c> like</c><00:32:16.630><c> okay</c><00:32:16.929><c> I'm</c><00:32:17.410><c> gonna</c><00:32:17.620><c> reframe</c><00:32:18.010><c> it</c><00:32:18.040><c> as</c>

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
is like okay I'm gonna reframe it as
 

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.130 align:start position:0%
is like okay I'm gonna reframe it as
excitement<00:32:19.000><c> and</c><00:32:19.120><c> energy</c><00:32:19.240><c> and</c><00:32:19.600><c> I'm</c><00:32:19.660><c> gonna</c><00:32:19.750><c> use</c>

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:20.140 align:start position:0%
excitement and energy and I'm gonna use
 

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.010 align:start position:0%
excitement and energy and I'm gonna use
it<00:32:20.169><c> to</c><00:32:20.770><c> really</c><00:32:21.070><c> dig</c><00:32:21.429><c> deep</c><00:32:21.460><c> and</c><00:32:21.850><c> do</c><00:32:22.120><c> like</c><00:32:22.720><c> a</c>

right and I like I didn't think that and
 

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.030 align:start position:0%
right and I like I didn't think that and
then<00:39:26.480><c> I</c><00:39:26.600><c> did</c><00:39:26.840><c> it</c><00:39:26.870><c> and</c><00:39:27.050><c> I</c><00:39:27.080><c> realized</c><00:39:27.350><c> okay</c><00:39:27.590><c> great</c>

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
