00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
something that was deemed no longer
impossible<00:08:07.840><c> and</c><00:08:08.000><c> they</c><00:08:08.240><c> said</c><00:08:08.560><c> i</c><00:08:08.879><c> can</c><00:08:09.120><c> do</c><00:08:09.360><c> it</c><00:08:09.919><c> and</c>

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
impossible and they said i can do it and

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
which is something we do with acting um

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
you can't force anything in life and so
 

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
you can't force anything in life and so
it<00:30:18.159><c> was</c><00:30:18.399><c> also</c><00:30:18.640><c> a</c><00:30:18.720><c> good</c><00:30:18.960><c> analogy</c><00:30:19.440><c> for</c><00:30:19.679><c> life</c><00:30:19.919><c> it</c>

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
it was also a good analogy for life it
 

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.389 align:start position:0%
it was also a good analogy for life it
was<00:30:20.159><c> a</c><00:30:20.240><c> good</c><00:30:20.399><c> analogy</c><00:30:20.960><c> for</c><00:30:21.120><c> my</c><00:30:21.360><c> art</c><00:30:21.760><c> to</c><00:30:21.919><c> go</c><00:30:22.159><c> back</c>

00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
was a good analogy for my art to go back
 

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:24.389 align:start position:0%
was a good analogy for my art to go back
into<00:30:22.960><c> relaxation</c>

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
into relaxation
 

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:25.750 align:start position:0%

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
because what is happening is
 

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.350 align:start position:0%
because what is happening is
everything's<00:30:26.159><c> speeding</c><00:30:26.640><c> up</c>

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
everything's speeding up

everything's speeding up

00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
and
 

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:30.389 align:start position:0%

00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
and that takes over and you can't get
 

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
and that takes over and you can't get
