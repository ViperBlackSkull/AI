crawling crawling we all crawl I can
kind<00:06:22.059><c> of</c><00:06:22.089><c> figure</c><00:06:22.269><c> out</c><00:06:22.300><c> how</c><00:06:22.389><c> to</c><00:06:22.479><c> crawl</c><00:06:22.749><c> yeah</c><00:06:23.110><c> but</c>

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
kind of figure out how to crawl yeah but
 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.209 align:start position:0%
kind of figure out how to crawl yeah but
it's<00:06:23.409><c> just</c><00:06:23.439><c> like</c><00:06:23.619><c> saying</c><00:06:23.799><c> can</c><00:06:23.919><c> you</c><00:06:23.979><c> figure</c><00:06:24.099><c> out</c>

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219 align:start position:0%
it's just like saying can you figure out
 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.889 align:start position:0%
it's just like saying can you figure out

right so what is your basic it doesn't
have<00:06:56.559><c> to</c><00:06:56.649><c> be</c><00:06:56.739><c> three</c><00:06:56.979><c> obviously</c><00:06:57.129><c> but</c><00:06:57.489><c> what</c><00:06:57.699><c> are</c>

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:57.819 align:start position:0%
have to be three obviously but what are
 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.269 align:start position:0%
have to be three obviously but what are
the<00:06:57.939><c> like</c><00:06:58.209><c> just</c><00:06:58.539><c> basics</c><00:06:59.110><c> is</c><00:06:59.259><c> it</c><00:06:59.379><c> air</c><00:06:59.589><c> squats</c><00:07:00.009><c> is</c>

from him is to have that attitude and I
