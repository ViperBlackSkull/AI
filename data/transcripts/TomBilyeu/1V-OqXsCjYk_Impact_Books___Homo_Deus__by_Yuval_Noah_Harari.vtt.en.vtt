to have another orgasm which means that

00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
worth something and because that because
 

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
worth something and because that because
they<00:12:10.160><c> were</c><00:12:10.279><c> willing</c><00:12:10.480><c> to</c><00:12:10.560><c> trade</c><00:12:10.760><c> it</c><00:12:10.839><c> for</c><00:12:10.959><c> goods</c>

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
they were willing to trade it for goods

they were willing to trade it for goods

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually get what he's saying uh because
 

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.950 align:start position:0%
actually get what he's saying uh because
you<00:23:01.720><c> do</c><00:23:02.520><c> if</c><00:23:02.720><c> data</c><00:23:03.000><c> isn't</c><00:23:03.240><c> were</c><00:23:03.520><c> to</c><00:23:03.640><c> sort</c><00:23:03.840><c> of</c>

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
you do if data isn't were to sort of
 

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.390 align:start position:0%
you do if data isn't were to sort of
swallow<00:23:04.400><c> the</c><00:23:04.520><c> world</c><00:23:04.919><c> then</c><00:23:05.159><c> AI</c><00:23:05.960><c> would</c><00:23:06.120><c> be</c><00:23:06.279><c> way</c>

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
swallow the world then AI would be way
 

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
swallow the world then AI would be way
more<00:23:06.600><c> important</c><00:23:06.919><c> than</c><00:23:07.080><c> humans</c><00:23:07.440><c> because</c><00:23:07.600><c> it</c>

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
more important than humans because it
 

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.470 align:start position:0%
more important than humans because it
can<00:23:08.440><c> uh</c><00:23:08.640><c> process</c><00:23:09.279><c> so</c><00:23:09.960><c> much</c><00:23:10.400><c> more</c><00:23:10.799><c> data</c><00:23:11.200><c> than</c><00:23:11.320><c> we</c>

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
can uh process so much more data than we
 

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.190 align:start position:0%
can uh process so much more data than we
can<00:23:11.919><c> so</c><00:23:12.240><c> much</c><00:23:12.440><c> more</c><00:23:12.720><c> rapidly</c><00:23:13.679><c> uh</c><00:23:13.799><c> it</c><00:23:14.000><c> would</c>

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
can so much more rapidly uh it would
 

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.990 align:start position:0%
can so much more rapidly uh it would
kick<00:23:14.400><c> off</c><00:23:14.559><c> a</c><00:23:14.679><c> lot</c><00:23:14.840><c> more</c><00:23:15.039><c> data</c><00:23:15.320><c> so</c><00:23:15.600><c> like</c><00:23:16.320><c> H</c><00:23:16.640><c> does</c>

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
kick off a lot more data so like H does
 

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.350 align:start position:0%
kick off a lot more data so like H does
one<00:23:17.320><c> human</c><00:23:17.679><c> life</c><00:23:18.080><c> really</c><00:23:18.600><c> matter</c><00:23:19.000><c> that</c><00:23:19.159><c> much</c>
