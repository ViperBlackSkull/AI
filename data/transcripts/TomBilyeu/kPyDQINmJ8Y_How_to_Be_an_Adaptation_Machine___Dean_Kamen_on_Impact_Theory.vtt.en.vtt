build<00:32:07.510><c> self-esteem</c><00:32:08.520><c> so</c><00:32:09.520><c> what</c><00:32:09.669><c> I</c><00:32:09.700><c> finally</c><00:32:10.000><c> did</c>

00:32:10.409 --> 00:32:10.419 align:start position:0%
build self-esteem so what I finally did
 

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
build self-esteem so what I finally did
and<00:32:10.750><c> it's</c><00:32:10.960><c> not</c><00:32:11.169><c> probably</c><00:32:11.500><c> not</c><00:32:11.650><c> the</c><00:32:11.830><c> most</c><00:32:12.040><c> proud</c>

00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:12.309 align:start position:0%
and it's not probably not the most proud
 

00:32:12.309 --> 00:32:14.850 align:start position:0%
and it's not probably not the most proud
of<00:32:12.370><c> this</c><00:32:12.820><c> is</c><00:32:13.299><c> I</c><00:32:13.630><c> reached</c><00:32:14.080><c> a</c><00:32:14.290><c> point</c><00:32:14.500><c> where</c><00:32:14.830><c> I</c>

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:14.860 align:start position:0%
of this is I reached a point where I
 

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.830 align:start position:0%
of this is I reached a point where I
just<00:32:14.950><c> said</c><00:32:15.460><c> yeah</c><00:32:15.760><c> these</c><00:32:16.030><c> teachers</c><00:32:16.450><c> will</c><00:32:16.570><c> keep</c>

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
just said yeah these teachers will keep
 

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.169 align:start position:0%
just said yeah these teachers will keep
giving<00:32:17.020><c> me</c><00:32:17.320><c> bad</c><00:32:17.530><c> grades</c><00:32:17.919><c> and</c><00:32:18.370><c> ridiculing</c><00:32:19.030><c> me</c>

but<00:32:21.669><c> I</c><00:32:21.700><c> finally</c><00:32:22.030><c> realized</c><00:32:22.330><c> they</c><00:32:23.110><c> just</c><00:32:23.350><c> have</c><00:32:23.500><c> a</c>

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.530 align:start position:0%
but I finally realized they just have a
 

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
but I finally realized they just have a

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:25.990 align:start position:0%

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:37.990 align:start position:0%

those tests you'd sit down like the SAT
 

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
those tests you'd sit down like the SAT
kind<00:32:42.730><c> of</c><00:32:42.820><c> thing</c><00:32:42.940><c> and</c><00:32:43.150><c> you</c><00:32:43.660><c> read</c><00:32:44.049><c> the</c><00:32:44.830><c> question</c>

kind of thing and you read the question
 

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and you read the question
and<00:32:45.900><c> then</c><00:32:46.900><c> you</c><00:32:46.960><c> had</c><00:32:47.200><c> to</c><00:32:47.320><c> pick</c><00:32:47.500><c> the</c><00:32:47.830><c> best</c><00:32:48.730><c> answer</c>

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:48.970 align:start position:0%
and then you had to pick the best answer
 

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then you had to pick the best answer
and<00:32:49.240><c> they'd</c><00:32:49.419><c> say</c><00:32:49.540><c> the</c><00:32:49.660><c> best</c><00:32:49.900><c> answer</c><00:32:50.350><c> a</c><00:32:50.500><c> B</c><00:32:50.679><c> C</c><00:32:50.860><c> or</c>

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:50.890 align:start position:0%
and they'd say the best answer a B C or
 

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
and they'd say the best answer a B C or
D<00:32:51.010><c> well</c><00:32:51.490><c> you'd</c><00:32:51.700><c> read</c><00:32:51.910><c> a</c><00:32:52.059><c> and</c><00:32:52.480><c> it's</c><00:32:52.600><c> ridiculous</c>

00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:53.169 align:start position:0%
D well you'd read a and it's ridiculous
 

00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
D well you'd read a and it's ridiculous
it's<00:32:54.040><c> almost</c><00:32:54.309><c> funny</c><00:32:55.049><c> B</c><00:32:56.049><c> huh</c><00:32:56.620><c> I</c><00:32:56.919><c> bet</c><00:32:57.610><c> that's</c>

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:58.030 align:start position:0%
it's almost funny B huh I bet that's
 

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's almost funny B huh I bet that's
almost<00:32:58.630><c> right</c><00:32:58.809><c> but</c><00:32:59.100><c> it's</c><00:33:00.100><c> subtle</c><00:33:00.400><c> and</c><00:33:00.669><c> it's</c>

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:00.790 align:start position:0%
almost right but it's subtle and it's
 

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
almost right but it's subtle and it's
not<00:33:00.940><c> right</c><00:33:01.090><c> before</c><00:33:01.419><c> that's</c><00:33:01.600><c> a</c><00:33:01.750><c> bad</c><00:33:01.960><c> thing</c>

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
not right before that's a bad thing
 

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
not right before that's a bad thing
because<00:33:02.410><c> you</c><00:33:03.250><c> could</c><00:33:03.400><c> almost</c><00:33:03.580><c> think</c><00:33:03.940><c> it</c><00:33:03.970><c> would</c>

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.090 align:start position:0%
because you could almost think it would
 

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.669 align:start position:0%
because you could almost think it would
work<00:33:04.150><c> so</c><00:33:04.390><c> it's</c><00:33:04.540><c> sort</c><00:33:04.720><c> of</c><00:33:04.750><c> reinforcing</c><00:33:05.530><c> a</c>

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
work so it's sort of reinforcing a
 

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
work so it's sort of reinforcing a
tricky<00:33:06.190><c> but</c><00:33:06.370><c> wrong</c><00:33:06.610><c> answer</c><00:33:07.000><c> C</c><00:33:07.929><c> yeah</c><00:33:08.169><c> that's</c>

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:08.350 align:start position:0%
tricky but wrong answer C yeah that's
 

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
tricky but wrong answer C yeah that's
probably<00:33:08.679><c> the</c><00:33:08.860><c> answer</c><00:33:09.070><c> they</c><00:33:09.370><c> won</c><00:33:09.669><c> d</c><00:33:10.540><c> no</c><00:33:11.429><c> but</c>

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:12.429 align:start position:0%
probably the answer they won d no but
 

00:33:12.429 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
probably the answer they won d no but
I'd<00:33:12.549><c> look</c><00:33:12.820><c> at</c><00:33:12.970><c> him</c><00:33:13.090><c> and</c><00:33:13.210><c> think</c><00:33:13.470><c> well</c><00:33:14.470><c> of</c><00:33:14.679><c> the</c>

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:14.830 align:start position:0%
I'd look at him and think well of the
 

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.370 align:start position:0%
I'd look at him and think well of the
answers<00:33:15.250><c> they</c><00:33:15.429><c> gave</c><00:33:15.809><c> those</c><00:33:16.809><c> four</c><00:33:17.169><c> they</c>

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:17.380 align:start position:0%
answers they gave those four they
 

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.570 align:start position:0%
answers they gave those four they
probably<00:33:17.740><c> want</c>

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:18.580 align:start position:0%
probably want
 

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.789 align:start position:0%
probably want
but<00:33:19.509><c> they</c><00:33:19.659><c> said</c><00:33:19.840><c> what's</c><00:33:20.019><c> the</c><00:33:20.169><c> best</c><00:33:20.320><c> answer</c><00:33:20.769><c> I</c>

00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
but they said what's the best answer I
 

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
but they said what's the best answer I
think<00:33:20.919><c> there's</c><00:33:21.250><c> got</c><00:33:21.370><c> to</c><00:33:21.490><c> be</c><00:33:21.519><c> a</c><00:33:21.610><c> better</c><00:33:21.789><c> answer</c>

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.330 align:start position:0%
think there's got to be a better answer
 

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.490 align:start position:0%
think there's got to be a better answer
and<00:33:22.450><c> I'd</c><00:33:22.509><c> sit</c><00:33:22.750><c> there</c><00:33:22.899><c> look</c><00:33:23.080><c> at</c><00:33:23.169><c> that</c><00:33:23.289><c> question</c>

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:23.500 align:start position:0%
and I'd sit there look at that question
 

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.649 align:start position:0%
and I'd sit there look at that question
and<00:33:23.679><c> try</c><00:33:24.159><c> to</c><00:33:24.220><c> think</c><00:33:24.429><c> of</c><00:33:24.610><c> a</c><00:33:24.669><c> better</c><00:33:24.940><c> answer</c><00:33:25.210><c> I</c>

00:33:25.649 --> 00:33:25.659 align:start position:0%
and try to think of a better answer I
 

00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
and try to think of a better answer I
got<00:33:25.899><c> a</c><00:33:25.929><c> better</c><00:33:26.200><c> answer</c><00:33:26.970><c> but</c><00:33:27.970><c> so</c><00:33:28.629><c> the</c><00:33:28.779><c> hours</c><00:33:29.110><c> up</c>

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
got a better answer but so the hours up
 

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.289 align:start position:0%
got a better answer but so the hours up
I<00:33:29.679><c> didn't</c><00:33:30.009><c> do</c><00:33:30.070><c> anything</c><00:33:30.340><c> but</c><00:33:30.820><c> I</c><00:33:30.909><c> got</c><00:33:30.940><c> a</c><00:33:31.059><c> better</c>

00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:31.299 align:start position:0%
I didn't do anything but I got a better
