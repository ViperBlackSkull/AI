  "transcript": "physical strength comes from breaking a muscle down a thousand times and growing back a little stronger each time emotional strength comes from someone's spirit being broken down a thousand times and growing back a little stronger each time the first happens naturally the second happens by choice if you were going through it right now think of your spirit as a muscle and right now you're working out you're at the gym it's being torn down and then you can choose to grow back stronger each time and there will come a time in the future where there is no weight or no stress that you cannot handle because of the amount of force that you've built in your spirit thinking through that as every time I was going through something hard I was building the muscle rather than thinking that I was being broken down was one of the things that got me through my hardest times\n"
