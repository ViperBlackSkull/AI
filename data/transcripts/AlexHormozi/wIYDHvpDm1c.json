  "transcript": "you don't need to be disciplined to be successful you need to be able to change your environment to make it easier to win and so one of my favorite quotes around this is make it as easy as possible to work as hard as you can if you want to get into fitness don't pick a gym that's really far away with trainers that you hate pick one that's right downstairs with people that you like same goal way easier the more convenient you make it to hit your goals the more likely you are to hit them and so it's not about willpower it's about planning\n"
