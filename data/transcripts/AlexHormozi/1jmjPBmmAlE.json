  "transcript": "if I didn't have the means that I have today to document stuff I'd still document I just do it differently so first off I would look at my calendar every week and I would consolidate all my learnings into one video and then I would just say anything that I had with customers of mine that they found valuable I would share and not things that I'm telling other people to do just saying things that I learned that's number one number two is I take way more pictures cuz pictures Take 2 seconds to take and when I look at the amount of pictures that I use in my presentations and on my sites they're almost all from when I had nothing now I get zillions of pictures taking me and I use none of them the pictures I would take would be for me I think the content that I would make would be public just because it has to be valuable to the audience so like the only reason a picture of me not having anything is valuable to the audience is because I have something now if I posted it when I had nothing people would be like yes I too am poor um\n"
