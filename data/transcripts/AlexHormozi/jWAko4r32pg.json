  "transcript": "in a group if you want to gain status the way you do it is by sacrificing more for the group than everyone else does if you want to gain status in a company you give more to the company than anyone else does more than the company gives you back because what do they do they reward that behavior the group rewards the person who gives to the group it's how it works the people who take from the group The only going to get status end up getting banished by the group and batted down because everyone wants to keep that person down because they don't serve anyone else and so it was only by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it I had to serve because when you serve someone you're giving them status you're increasing your guard for others when I gave status I got it back and if you do that I promise you you will have all the status you want\n"
