  "transcript": "School teachers right now is convergent thinking and so that means that there's multiple variables and one correct answer and so it's like one plus one equals two there's only one answer and now they're even telling you there's only one way to find the answer and if you don't find it the way they want you to find it then it's also wrong which is ridiculous but anyways my Virgin thinking is when you have multiple variables but multiple correct answers how many different ways can you use a brick what's interesting about that is that you can also have multiple right answers and some answers that are more right than others which becomes very difficult to grade but also how the real world works and we're rewarded based on how right our YouTube video really is right or how right our article is or how right our product is and how we can solve problems using more creative methods than trying to converge on a single answer because if it's a convergent thinking process for the most part it's already been kind of automated and everyone can do it more of the education systems be around Divergent thinking and diversion problem solving\n"
