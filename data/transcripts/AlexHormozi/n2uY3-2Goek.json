  "transcript": "you get more out of reading one book that's great five times than out of reading five mediocre books if your behavior doesn't change as a result of reading a book and it means you learn nothing which means it was a waste of time and many people who read books are just wasting their time because their behavior doesn't change and so I consolidate once I find something that's good I plug everything I possibly can into it and suck the juice out of it so that I can change my behavior as a result which comes from the Frameworks and how I think about it so I read one thing that's very good many times rather than trying to brag about the fact that I read a book a week because I'm like what was the book last week not that good that it wasn't worth rereading\n"
