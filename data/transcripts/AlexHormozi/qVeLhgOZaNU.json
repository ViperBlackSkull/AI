  "transcript": "it won't get harder this is the hardest part everything else is downhill it's not that the dragons are going to slay aren't going to get bigger they are but you become so much more equipped to slay them back and you have so many more allies you have people in the stands cheering for you you have the audience you have all of these other things that are behind you but in the beginning it's just you with a stick against a bear and arguably that fight is a harder fight to win than beating a dragon when you have a nuclear bomb and Six Nations behind you it's not even like the size of the hardship it's just also the resources and how few of them you have and how so much of the beginning is literally burning the one thing you have which is time\n"
