  "transcript": "in order for a process to be put in place and stay within an organization it has to make a net benefit on the organization if I ask the sales team to write notes in the CRM it will have a local cost they will now have more work to do than they did before now if those notes then get used by customer support onboarding product and delivery and they're really integral to the rest of their client experience there is going to be a global benefit so more people benefit the organization will benefit from this small cost that's a good return on investment often times quote systems people don't think that way they just think everything has to be somewhere and we have to put systems around everything if I don't use some of that information then maybe I shouldn't ask my sales guys to write that down cuz all I'm doing is incurring a local cost but I don't have a clear benefit\n"
