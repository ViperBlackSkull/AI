  "transcript": "I developed a base level skill and I Bartered with everyone but the way I Bartered was that I would do the work first 100% as though they were a paid client and then I would give it to them and then they would get really uncomfortable and they' be like oh my God I can't believe you do this so I would offer to hop on a call and have done a ton of work before I hop on and not only identify problems but already create the solutions that I think would help them and then when I would walk them through all the things I'm seeing you will see their eyes like glaze over in a good way where they're like holy  like this is so much like I can't believe you did this like dude I feel bad what what can I do to help you out and that is what will happen when you don't just give with the intention of exchanging but give with the intention of blowing their minds\n"
