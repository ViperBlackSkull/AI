  "transcript": "when I was in a fraternity I found out that like clockwork every single pledge class revolts and tries to quit all at once usually within 10 to 14 days of starting when I was President I got the opportunity to sit down with my pledge class of people so I just said hey guys who expected this to be easy no one raised their hand okay so you guys expected this to be hard this what you guys are feeling right now this is what hard feels like and all I did was just reset expectations of like this is what reality looks like and so I like to remind myself when I'm going through these hard times it's like you probably signed up and didn't think it was going to be easy but you didn't think it is going to feel like this it's the uncertainty of not knowing if it's going to work out it's having to make decisions with incomplete information all the while just hoping on a prayer that it's going to work that's what makes it hard and that's why it's worth it\n"
