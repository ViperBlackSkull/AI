  "transcript": "actually took me a long time to figure out what the difference between outbound and inbound was outbound is where the first contact with a prospect is in a private setting inbound is when the first contact with the prospect is in a public setting let's say someone hits a lead page right they opt in and then you you know message them are they outbound no they the first Contact they had with you was they saw an ad and then they clicked and then they became somebody that you talk one-on-one to cuz they're a prospect right that's why the first Contact is what defines where the lead came from\n"
