  "transcript": "document doesn't necessarily mean have somebody follow you around with a videotape all day cuz a lot of you guys have really boring lives and no one wants to watch it I'm just being really real with you but you can document in other formats and I talk about this in $100 million leads book which is look at your calendar and think okay what were the lessons from this week you can still crystalize or create an artifact from the week that consolidates a week's worth of stuff into 10 minutes that will be valuable so thinking like how can I distill things that happen so you're still documenting it doesn't mean you have to just capture it in real time and so I think having a method for documenting so for me Twitter is my actual document I would encourage you to have some outlet with the least amount of friction possible crystallize the learnings from the week or the month or the day and I think doing that will provide value to an audience\n"
