  "transcript": "I used to get a ton of shoulder pain like a lot because I'd sit at my desk all day and so I did all these different PT exercises and none of them worked and what I figured out was all I had to do is lower my desk to where my hands would already be whereas if I spend 4 hours of my day like this basically I'm in this little tense position for hours and hours and so just putting it that's why I don't have armrests on this chair is so that I can basically get this as low as humidly possible so it's just like sitting on my thighs and then I can work so little life hack for you for anybody who has shoulder pain\n"
