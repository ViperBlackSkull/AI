  "transcript": "the first 6 hours of my day every day is dedicated to the activities that I need to do to move the business forward I don't take meetings I don't take calls it's just me after that 6 hours is when my day started in the early days when I had customers that meant that I would work from 4: to 10: and then I would do all my customer stuff after that and I say that because if you were the entrepreneur then in the beginning your responsibility is to let other people know about your stuff if more people know about your stuff more people will buy it\n"
