  "transcript": "20-year-olds stay poor because they start trying to earn rather than trying to learn they don't realize the season they're in and they do it out of order and so they try and go and right hook life and get as much they possibly can rather than realizing that when a business is trading with you the only thing you're getting paid for isn't just money you also get paid with experience and if you're the one who's coming in with all the experience guess what you're not getting paid with experience from other people if you come in for half the price in terms of your salary at a company that has a way better reputation way more people ahead of you you will get paid less in the short run in money but you will get paid more longterm in skills\n"
