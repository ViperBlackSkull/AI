  "transcript": "why are unmade decisions so heavy at least for me it's because I have this hamster wheel on the my back of my mind where I keep playing out different scenarios because I'm I'm a big frame guy so I'm like maybe I just need to be thinking about this or maybe if I zoom all the way out the Earth doesn't exist so maybe this doesn't matter you know I reframe all those things but usually it's just because I'm afraid of something and then that's why I'm not making the decisions and it's usually not even a thing that I'm afraid of it's one person's judgment I'm afraid of and then when I name the person then it becomes real instead of being this amorphous like people Society judgment it's like Tom like do I really care what Tom thinks I guess so it seems like I'm not making this big change in my life because of Tom looks like Tom's more in control of my life than I am\n"
