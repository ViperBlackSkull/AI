  "transcript": "if you put an animal in a cage they can't escape then they will revert to law of least effort so they will do as little as they can to not get punished and so then when you're in a punishing environment all you have to do to get them to do more is you just raise the bar for what they have to Law's least effort do to not get punished and so in an environment of high performers that gets everyone to raise the bar but then quickly burn out now that model works if you have an endless supply of bodies but if you are the person who is being burned out then that works for 2 years or whatever Praise on the other hand or reward can unlock in my opinion discretionary effort the effort beyond the law of least effort required to keep your job and not get punished the issue is that the people who are the most able are the ones who are able to work the least and still keep their jobs but they're also the ones who you get the absolute most upside on if they work because they want to not because they have to\n"
