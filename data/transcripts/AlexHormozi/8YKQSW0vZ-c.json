  "transcript": "so if you ever feel like you're addicted to your phone you're addicted to social media this is the hack that takes two seconds that saved me so much time I actually turned my screen into black and white and so you can fix this in the settings and what happens is all of a sudden you stop reaching for your phone as much because it becomes less addicting and if you do it for 24 hours I promise it's the craziest thing in the world when you pull it back up again and you actually turn color back on you'll be like whoa and you'll realize why it's so addicting to begin with and so if you have those struggles at least like I did it was one of the best and highest Roi hacks that I had to make my phone less addicting\n"
