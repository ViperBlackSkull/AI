  "transcript": "if you're one of these people who like I want to be involved in everything I want things to run past me like no one can do it like I can do it like I can never find someone who's better than me well the most arrogant egotistical thing I can possibly imagine there's a zillion people who can do it better than you and not only are there zillion people who can do it better than you there's zilon people who can do it better than you especially if they had all their time to do it whereas you're a fractional you you're like a 15% marketing director and a 15% sales director and a 15% salesman but you're also looking at finances and also hopping on hiring interviews and all that stuff so of course people should be able to do it better than you be embarrassing if they couldn't do it better\n"
