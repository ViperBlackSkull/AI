  "transcript": "when we teach things from babies all the way to adults it's associating things that people know with things that they don't know the thing that they know should be the valuable thing and the thing they don't know is your brand and so then you associate the thing that that audience deems valuable with this logo or this tagline or these colors or these shapes or this person and then they say oh these are similar and then you do it enough times that eventually they become one and the same and then you can drop the thing and have the person and they will still behave the same way as though they were receiving this value but that has now been disassociated or at least not paired in the same image but then you can take that logo or brand and Associate it with something new because now they do know this thing and put it onto a T-shirt and then they will behave in the same way\n"
