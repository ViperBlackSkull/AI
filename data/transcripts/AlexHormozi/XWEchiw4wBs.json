  "transcript": "100% of humans are replaced every 100 years and we continue on as a species cuz we learn from others so have you ever heard if you want it done right do it yourself no one can do it like I do it nobody can replace me I'm irreplaceable those are incorrect beliefs about how to do business replace it with these thoughts and these thoughts have served me well if you want it done right get someone to spend all their time doing it if I can do it someone else can do it better than M everyone is replaceable especially M because even if you are better than them spending 100% of your time you're not going to cuz you got other you're going to do if you own the business so it makes sense that even if somebody's half as good as you if they spend 100% of their time they still probably do a better job and if you still don't think they're better than you I'll bet you 20 of them are right\n"
