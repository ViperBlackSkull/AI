  "transcript": "so as soon as you get good at something whether it's doing taxes editing videos running Facebook ads designing websites you have some craft that you are good at if you are good your business will grow and at some point you will be able to take on more customers you'll have two options at that point one is that you can continue to raise the price in that instance you become the artist you're continuing to get better and better at it you still have more and more demand because you love doing the thing if your art is business the business of making that thing and delivering it to lots of people becomes your art form and that's when you start hiring and systematizing the people to deliver that thing on your behalf most people think that one is right and one is wrong and I don't think that's true it's the one that's right for you if you love doing taxes because some people do then you should just continue to raise your taxes and be the best tax guy in the world and guess what those guys make a ton of money on the flip side if you love building the machine that does taxes then start H R Block and create the system the business of taxes and open 500 locations both of them are passed that can make you a lot of money but I think the biggest mistake people make is not knowing which type of person they are\n"
