  "transcript": "when I'm struggling to find gratitude in my life one of the most powerful perspectives I've used to immediately feel it is that I imagine everything I'm doing whether it's washing dishes whether it's vacuuming the floor whether it's saying goodbye to my wife whatever the thing is I imagine it's the last time Emma we're gonna do it and what's crazy is that there are lots of things that as we get older we never know the last time we'll do something I can't tell you the last time I had a sleepover but if I knew when I was 11 years old that this was the last sleepover I was ever going to have I would have been more grateful for it and so if you can look at that lens knowing that like there are some things that for the rest of your life you're never going to do it again it makes me appreciate the moment more\n"
