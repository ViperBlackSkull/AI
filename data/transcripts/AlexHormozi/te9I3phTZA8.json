  "transcript": "one of my favorite quotes from blae Pascal is to understand is to forgive it's like if you really see someone and you see all the things that they went through and the things that happened to them to become who they are then you understand them and then you understand why they did X Y and Z because if we don't understand we assume that it's because they're just evil people and most people aren't that way they're this way because they've been reinforced or punished for doing something like that in the past\n"
