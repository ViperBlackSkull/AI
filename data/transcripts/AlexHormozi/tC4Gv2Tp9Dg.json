  "transcript": "trying to grow a business is in some ways more complex and difficult than saying if I were to destroy my business in as few moves as possible what would I do and so then thinking well if I wanted to absolutely destroy my business I would do this first and then I would do this second and then I would do this third and then I would do this fourth and you create that list and all of a sudden what's interesting about it is that we have such a stronger ability to find threats and negatives in our environment than we do positives and so it's like if I were to ask you hey tell me 10 things you're grateful for you might be like well uh right now if I said tell me about 10 you have in your life you could probably rattle off a 100 without breaking a sweat it's because we're way more wired to find threats in the environment than find good things now using that engine we apply it to a business or personal setting or any complex problem and say okay I'm going to find all the ways I'm going to destroy my business and then you invert it\n"
