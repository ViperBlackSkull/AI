  "transcript": "if you want to get better at sales and you're the sole owner of your business what I recommend doing is recording all of the calls you have the first and cheapest thing you can do listen to the ones that went well and listen to the ones that didn't and then try and see the differences between the two I think the better thing to do is to give those recordings of your sales calls to somebody who is a really good closer and then ask them to give you feedback on the calls and be specific about how you want them to give feedback just say hey if I could improve one or two things on the call what would you tell me to do go do those things and come back and send them the next recording so what you're doing is you're basically recreating a sales manager salesman relationship with somebody outside of your organization and if you want trade with that person is something that you're better than them at\n"
