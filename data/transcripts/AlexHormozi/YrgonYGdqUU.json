  "transcript": "if you want to win big in the beginning you're not going to have it all you're going to start earlier you're going to work later you're going to work weekends you're going to skip beers with the boys you're going to miss a dance recital or a baseball game the question is just whether you want to make the trade for the thing that you want now for the thing that you want most and everything has a price and so if you're not willing to make the trade there's nothing wrong with that it's just about what trades you are willing to make because the person who wants to be you is willing to trade more than you are\n"
