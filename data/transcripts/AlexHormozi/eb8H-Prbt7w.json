  "transcript": "I want to publicly State wholeheartedly that I am hardcore against anyone thinking they deserve anything so people are like get what you deserve ask what what you want blah you don't deserve anything you can get things for what you do but you don't deserve them because if you do get things when you believe you deserve them then you will not be grateful for them you will expect them and then it takes something that otherwise would have been amazing and nullifies it it's like spitting on a gift\n"
