  "transcript": "how much did how much did the website cost you I think it was 370 something 370 dollars thousand what the was it someone just domain squatting yeah you just talk it down what was the original price no I just came into asking they were in talks for somebody else and they made a negotiator I am but what's the goal you know what I mean for me the cost of negotiating it because you had another buyer that they had been haggling with and so I figured that the seller was kind of tired of haggling with this other guy I think the number that they were at was like 325 or something like that and they were trying to create some sort of payment plan and I was like I'll pay 370 today cash I can wear it tomorrow and so the deal closed in like two days and they had been in talks for like two months for me it's like is there actually a difference in how much value I'm gonna get out of something if I pay 50 000 less or the downside risk of me just not getting it for me is significantly higher\n"
