  "transcript": "a guy reached out to me who was in a similar is space years ago probably 5 years ago he came to me thinking that he had a sales and marketing problem the real problem was that he wasn't making enough per customer and it was because he wasn't really that good for being real and so because he could not provide value sufficiently to his customers he couldn't charge a sufficient amount and so he could promise all the stuff and sell people at the same rate and same cost roughly that I was we just made 10 times more than he did but a net profit at the end of the year it ended up being 50 plus times and that is ultimately will separate the best advertis from the worst isn't even the advertising itself you just need to be good enough to get people in and they let the business model take care of the rest\n"
