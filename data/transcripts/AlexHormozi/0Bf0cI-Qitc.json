  "transcript": "media is the only business where marketing and delivery are the same so think about this if you had let's say a show like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan's marketing for Joe Rogan is his delivery for Joe Rogan which is one of the ways that media creates even more leverage because if you think about from operational perspective you can just have one team that does all days focusing on marketing expanding the audience pumping and Drilling and pumping and drilling it's getting you new people and the more people you get from your marketing the more eyeballs and ear balls you sell on the back end through sponsors and endorsements now we're not doing that but I find it really really interesting to think about that is that there's no other business where the thing that you market and the thing that you sell are literally the same\n"
