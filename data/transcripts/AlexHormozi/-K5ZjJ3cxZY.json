  "transcript": "well Chick-fil-A is a amazing mod because Chick-fil-A owns the dirt the building and they own the business and so then they partner with what they call operators like they're franchises but they're not franchises because they can fire you and all you have to do is put $10,000 in and they pick out of like 10,000 applicants a year for like a 100 spots it's a 2-year vetting process you have to have already worked at a chick-fil for like 3 to 5 years in order to be qualified for it the sales I think it's it's over 4 million per location I think it's 4.8 here's what's even crazier they have better margins than any other franchise and so since they own the dirt and the land in the building the business pays them back right cuz they lease it and then corporate gets a 15% rip on Top Line in food and then they split 50/50 The Profit with the operator after they took off all the Top Line the average operator makes $200,000 a year but they're making 15% on that and then half of the excess profit 700,000 a year off Top Line and then the other two so they're making like 900,000 a year per location not including the mortgage the appreciation on the building everything Chick-fil-A did the slow and steady and now they're unbeatable\n"
