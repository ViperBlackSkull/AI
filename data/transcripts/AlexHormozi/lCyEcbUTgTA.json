  "transcript": "the thing that I keep coming back to that makes entrepreneurship difficult is that you have a known cost for an unknown payoff sometimes it's a week sometimes it's a month sometimes it's a year and sometimes more realistically it's years plural before you get the paycheck back and the paycheck isn't always money sometimes it's just knowing that the thing you said was going to happen happens or that maybe your wife looks at you a different way or maybe it's your your family that looks at you a different way you want status within your community whatever it is and it just comes down to this absolute Soul crushing uncertainty with the idea that no one can actually tell you and you have this unquenched desire to be able to predict the future while at the same time knowing that you can't and you have this desire because every day you learn something and then you look back a year ago and you're like why the hell did I not know this like I'm such an idiot it feels like I'm starting all over again today because of what I just recently learned all the work that I did up to this point is useless but that's the wrong way to see it because like you are the work that you've been working on this entire time and the fact that you can see what you were doing before was not nearly as fruitful as it could have been is the progress that you are making\n"
