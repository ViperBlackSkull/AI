  "transcript": "I would read all the self up books every night that's all I did I just read all these self up books and I found one of them that said there are people who are wantrepreneurs and entrepreneurs and I remember hearing that word wantrepreneur I was like I don't want to be wantrepreneurs but what if they're right I am a wantrepreneur I'm not an entrepreneur I want to be one and I'm not and from that point it took me six months to quit my job to actually decide to do the entrepreneurial thing\n"
