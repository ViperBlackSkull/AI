  "transcript": "most people act really dumb because they don't know the definition of intelligence so it takes 20 hours to become proficient at virtually any skill the problem is it takes people years to start the first hour they're afraid of looking stupid but intelligence is the rate at which we acquire new skills so if you are a slow acquirer of behaviors it means that you are stupid and if you don't start things it means you're slow the fastest way to change your behavior is to begin which is what makes you smart so by trying to avoid feeling stupid you end up becoming it\n"
