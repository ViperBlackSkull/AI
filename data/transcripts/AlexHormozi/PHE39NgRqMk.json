  "transcript": "the thing that I enjoyed the most was powerlifting but for me it started wearing down my joints I pulled my leg out of the car to get out of it because my hips were so beat up from the amount of volume I was doing and I remember looking around and being alone in the parking lot taking my leg out and I was like what am I doing this for that's when I transitioned to kind of like traditional bodybuilding or strength training I did more volume higher rep ranges slightly lower weight so I enjoyed the outcome of power lifting more but I enjoy the training style itself of bodybuilding more\n"
