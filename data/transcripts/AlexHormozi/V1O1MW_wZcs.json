  "transcript": "one of the easiest ways that I increase the productivity of a sales team is when I read the sales script I look for the parts where they talk about the features they talk about the pieces of the service of the product that they deliver to the customer and usually it's dead wrong and so we swap with the features isn't benefits because that's what a lot of people talk about but it's actually anecdotal or stories that can relate the experience to the customer rather than having your laundry list of features I like to give three analogies no more no less that illustrate different aspects of the product and what experiencing it would look like and ideally stories of people just like them experiencing the result of the product the way they want their problem to be solved\n"
