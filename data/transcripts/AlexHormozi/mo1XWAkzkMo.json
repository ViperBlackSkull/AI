  "transcript": "my two favorite questions to ask in business and in life are what problem are we solving and let's play it out it's like taking the next three to five moves I quit my job then what happened let's play it out like what actually happened because people were like I'm gonna be homeless that's probably not realistic play it out you're not going to spend the same amount of money if you don't have the income okay well what do you think you would actually live on this okay if I actually ran out of money what would I do well I'd probably call my parents up and I probably see them on the couch okay what pain would I experience in doing that I'd probably have to be under their rules which would blow there are pains and then the question is if these are the costs that are a short-term cost in order to avoid the long-term consequence of this continued zombie existence where I do not want to be here is that a price I'm willing to pay\n"
