  "transcript": "I've lost it all twice I sold my gyms and then I took the money and I lost the money from the sale of my gym so I basically had nothing I lost everything and so that's where desperation a lot of times leads to Innovation and so rather than start from scratch I said let me call people who have gyms I got on the phone with guys that I had done these launches for and sold them on me just teaching them how to do this wholesale system the key there was that I didn't have a gym anymore if I were to lose it all again I would be going to businesses that were similar to one that I built and say I can help you add x amount of money\n"
