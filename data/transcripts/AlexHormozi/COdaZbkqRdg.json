  "transcript": "I'm not saying you shouldn't fire people who mess up but the only point of firing is to decrease the likelihood of an error occurring in the future I'll still have to recruit hire and train and bring them to someone else on that might still make the same mistake and if I already paid a million bucks to have one person make the mistake the only Dumber thing is to pay a million bucks twice to have another person learn it and let's be real if you're the entrepreneur in the situation how many times have you made massive fuckups all the time we're human and we can't expect our employees to not make mess ups either and sometimes the more responsibility you give someone the bigger the fuckups they can have and the bigger the business the more costly the mistakes will be so this just comes down with the territory of doing big business cuz what's the alternative right you go do everything yourself it doesn't work so mistakes are going to happen\n"
