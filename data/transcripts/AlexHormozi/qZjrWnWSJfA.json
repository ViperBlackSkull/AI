  "transcript": "if you're a younger guy you're trying to move up in the workplace I want to tell you the secret that took me way too long to understand effort is the universal currency of respect it doesn't matter how lame you might be or how lame you might think you are how not good you are at something every single person across cultures across age groups respects effort and so the one thing that we can control is the effort that we dedicate to a task and so if you can put everything you have into achieving what you want people will give you the respect you deserve based on what you are doing not the outcome because the outcome my friends will come\n"
