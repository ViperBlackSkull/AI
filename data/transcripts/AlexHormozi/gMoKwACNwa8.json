  "transcript": "most people can't comprehend that someone is doing 50 times more work than them people do astonishingly little and that's okay cuz humans are meant to conserve energy we're predisposed to laziness there's a time for leverage but sometimes it's just violence it's just Brute Force it's forcing the outcome if you suck at Cold calls do more cold calls not twice as many do 20 times more and you'll get better 20 times faster than you would and I actually think it's even faster than that cuz if you do 20 times the calls one guy does 3 hours of calls a week and I do 60 hours of calls a week so 20 20 times the output it would taken 20 weeks to get to that same number of reps but because my feet back Loops are shorter I also get better faster I do more work in a shorter period and then my skill also improves faster then you look like an outlier on the map and everyone's like what did this guy do it's like he literally did 20 times more work\n"
