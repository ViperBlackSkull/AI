  "transcript": "honestly most of the times the advice that I need is it's actually like more emotional than it is like business strategy it's more like I need to keep being patient cuz a lot of times like you know the right thing to do you just need to be okay with it taking longer or being harder than you originally set out I one of my favorite quotes ever is we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and so it's like a lot of times the future version of you is just there to remind you not necessarily teach you anything you already don't know\n"
