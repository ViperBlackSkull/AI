  "transcript": "if someone wants to pay $400 and your price is$ 500 you can give them the discount in exchange for an introduction to three friends if you're a smaller business owner and you start doing business with other business owners they're going to try and squeeze you what you can do is say okay well I can't out of Ethics charge you differently than I charge someone else for the same services but if you're willing to send me somebody else I can lower the price to X how does that sound and so what happens is you actually change the terms of sale you add another variable to the negotiation again I'm starting with three and I do that on purpose cuz you might have ared to me like oh just ask for one ask for three for $100 decrease and if they say no they be like all right how about too and so this gives you a chip to negotiate with to both close the sale and bring two more customers in\n"
