  "transcript": "you can feel bad and do nothing about it the fact that I feel terrible is an emotion which has nothing to do with the actions that I'm choosing to take because every action that I would take as a result of feeling this discomfort is only going to lead me further away from my goal or cause me to act in a way that's not conducive to what I want and often times when we go to New Growth levels there is discomfort that's why it's called Growing Pains not growing gains and so you actually grow more slowly trying to combat your discomfort rather than accepting it for what it is as a requisite for the success that you want to have\n"
