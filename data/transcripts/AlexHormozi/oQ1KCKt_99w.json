  "transcript": "if you had to create a human what would you put them through to make them tough it wouldn't be a really chill life what would you put them through to make them patient well you probably wouldn't give them things immediately and so it's like we want these trades but each of the traits has a price tag attached to it it's just like do you want to pay the price tag to get the thing and so I think if if people reframe the period of life that they're going through as the price that they're paying out of their wallet but the wallet is their time it's the seconds of life that they're trading for it then I think more people be willing to make the trade because at least when I look at myself when I'm 80 something years old and I'm looking back on my life I want to have these traits but in order to have those traits I know I have to go through these things and I think for me that's given me a lot of comfort in hard times\n"
