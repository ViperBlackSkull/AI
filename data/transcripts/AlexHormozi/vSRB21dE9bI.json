  "transcript": "most of the times if I'm angry it means I don't fully understand the situation I felt like I had a bone to pick with both my parents I was an angrier kid when I wrote my mother's story from the fact that she was born in France came here when she was four got beat up as a kid didn't speak English but I was like going through this and thinking you know it makes sense she is this way I just remember this kind of very disarming moment being like I can't be angry with you I get it it was tough I'm sorry and then she just like burst into tears I think that was kind of a big breakthrough for me as a person because I was like huh this person that I've like held all this anger towards my anger came from ignorance that's been a frame that I've tried to approach situations and when I start feeling angry about something I'm like what do I not understand and that kind of helps me defuse those things and so I think over time that's helped me in business scenarios and business settings make better decisions\n"
