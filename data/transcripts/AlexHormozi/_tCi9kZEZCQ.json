  "transcript": "if you want to move up in a company think about ways that you can make the company more money have a little bit of evidence and create a little mini project scope that explains your idea in a pager to and present it and I can guarantee you that people above you if you're in any kind of organization that has any Merit at all will be very thrilled that you're bringing this and trying it out now if you're some Mega Corp maybe not but any like sub $50 million year business should encourage you to do that in my opinion\n"
