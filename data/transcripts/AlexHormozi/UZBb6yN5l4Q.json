  "transcript": "we were meant to work we were built to work yes and so last year we exited three of our companies and during that year I wasn't really allowed to work we also couldn't make any big changes I pretty much had to sit idle and it was one of the more depressed years of my life I had to just sit on my hands and do nothing we learned to derive pleasure from work in a job well done the gain or pleasure that you get is proportional to the pain that you experienced to achieve the outcome if something comes easy it means less to you\n"
