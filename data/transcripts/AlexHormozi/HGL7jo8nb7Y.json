  "transcript": "so one of my heroes Warren Buffett he finished top of his class at Columbia somebody who finished his top of their class at Columbia can get a job paying very well in most places but guess what he did he asked Ben Graham to let him work at his investment firm for free because he realized that he was going to get more than he could possibly be compensated for and guess what Ben Graham said to him when he asked him to work for him he said you're overpriced because Ben Graham knew just as Warren Buffett knew that even though he was working for free it was going to cost Ben Graham more to deliver all of the skills and all of the things that he would need to be successful than the monetary compensation but because Warren Buffett is smart he realized that he was in a season of learning and not earning yet and so he was willing to invest as one of the greatest investors of all time in the thing that was most important and valuable to him at the time himself\n"
