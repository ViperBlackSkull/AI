  "transcript": "I lost $35 million I had a competitor come out and make a new offering and I thought I had to change my business in response to that and so what I did was I added more services to my main service and I decreased my cost and nothing happened the same amount of customers stayed they just paid less and I took all of that off of my profit when I sold my company for $ 46.2 million a few years later I never had recovered that profit that I lost and the difference was $35 million all because I was thinking about my competitors more than my customers losers focus on winners winners focus on winning\n"
