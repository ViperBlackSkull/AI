  "transcript": "how I would launch a no strip business if I were to launch one so they currently sell for about 30 cents a strip they probably cost a penny or less to make 19.99 would probably be a price point that I would look at maybe 24.99 I would you know we'd split test the price points there and I'd probably sell 30 60 90 packs but let's do the math on how much money this would make if I just did my own promotion let's say 10 000 people a month would go to a page if I said hey check this out and then we converted five percent of traffic then we would have 500 buyers 10 churn that means that every month I would sign up 500 and then I'd lose 10 percent this business would keep growing with that level of traffic until we reached 5 000 users because it's 500 divided by 10 which is the churn I would be at 5 000 users a month and if my price point was twenty dollars so I'd probably make like they safely even after the cost of the no strips which is minimal let's just say we make 16 gross margin on a 20 product eighty thousand dollars a month million dollars a year in profit from the no strips\n"
