  "transcript": "givers move faster in life because they get opportunities that matchers and takers don't and that also means that the majority of people are matchers and takers which means that if you are a giver it means you will be taken advantage of more times than you will get anything back but you will still make more from the few times that you do invest in another giver and so that's why when givers recognize givers they stay homies for life and then they go out of their way to always trying and outg give one another and then both people go up that's the kind of community you want and that's why it takes time to build a network of people that are actually valuable\n"
