  "transcript": "you gain status by giving more to the group than you get it's how it works the people who take from the group and only want to get status they only going to get status from the group end up getting banished by the group and batted down because everyone wants to keep that person down because they don't serve anyone else and so it was only by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it I had to serve because when you serve someone you're giving them status you're increasing your regard for others all of these things started compounding when I realized that truth that humility is not thinking less of yourself it's thinking more about other people and increasing your regard for their needs and if you do that I promise you you will have all the status you want\n"
