  "transcript": "no one's afraid of failing people are afraid of other people's judgment about their failure if you could fail in private no one would know like when you play video games and you lose the level you're not embarrassed i' would love to say like all these people are failing and this is the thing that would fix it it's like most people just don't take action to begin with a lot of it is in action which is why I talk a lot about fear failure being the actual enemy rather than failure itself\n"
