  "transcript": "you have to let other people's dream of you die so that your dream can live because there's only so much of you to go around everybody else is trying to get you to be the version of you that best serves them including your family I don't think it's a malicious intention but they have goals for you that are probably not your goals for you and somebody's goals have to die and where most of them die is right in the middle which is you try and do theirs and you try and do yours and you actually accomplish neither so you might as well do 100% yours do none of theirs and then actually achieve the longterm goal which they probably have is that you live a happy and successful life\n"
