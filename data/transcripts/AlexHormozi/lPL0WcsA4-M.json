  "transcript": "the reason I published my first book $100 million offers is because I want to make sure people knew what to sell right and make really good offers because once you get that right then you can usually quickly Skyrocket above $12 $3 million in profit per year and then it's much more interesting for us we don't want to incur that cost of trial and error and iteration because it's just it's not that we don't think we could figure it out it's just not worth the time I'd rather work with companies that already have that and then scale it\n"
