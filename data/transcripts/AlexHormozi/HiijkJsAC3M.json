  "transcript": "had a gentleman the other day who said hey can you walk me through the closer framework I'm currently not using it in my sales process and I was like well what's your close rate it's like 40% I was like why are we talking you flew across the country you had one question that you were going to ask and you ask about something that's not the con of the business because he loves sales so you just want to hear hear me talk about sales stuff which I can understand and I appreciate that but like doesn't help him and so being able to accurately identify what the problem is and allocate resources accordingly is going to make you a lot of money it's probably the single skill that has made me the highest return in my life\n"
