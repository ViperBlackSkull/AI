  "transcript": "you're not making as much money as you want to make because you're not getting as many leads as you need to have to sell stuff to and you're probably not getting as many leads as you need because you're not giving away enough free stuff and this is a sneak preview of my 100 million leads book just a snippet from just one chapter and at the end I'm going to give you a seven point checklist that you can use to immediately deploy this in your business so you can get more leads and also make more money for Less the reason people buy is based on a prediction of future value so they buy because they predict that they will get value from you later what is the easiest way to get someone to predict they're going to get value from you after you buy by giving them value before they buy there's two ways that you can fundamentally get leads you can one just make your offer to somebody and say hey I will wash your car for a hundred dollars now you can put lots of Razzle Dazzle around it that is a offer products or services that you exchange money for and the terms under which you do that exchange and so this is directly from my first book 100 million dollar offers or an Espanol [Music] sorry a core offer versus a league man what's the difference right because fundamentally you'll have something that's valuable in both of these instances the core offer is the thing you sell that makes you the most money if you're like which one is it the one that makes the most money that's your core offer then all of a sudden you start making more money on your lead magnet guess what that's actually your core offer lead magnet is the thing before the thing lead magnet is not a partial solution all right what a lot of people try and do is like hey I'm gonna give you the first six minutes of this 12 minute video and get the rest click here right I think that's that's not the right way to do it I think you lose trust and that's literally the opposite of the objective of lead magnetic a lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrowly defined problem if you're gonna do anything for a customer there are many micro steps that happen to create a bigger solution let's say I paint houses there's a lot of micro steps that have to happen in order for a house to get painted first you've got to size up the house then you have to give an estimate of whatever then you have to do the design component and you have to do the 3D visualization the bigger the thing is the more steps there are the idea is okay can I pick one of these very painful steps for my Prospect and solve it for them at a massive discount to attract more people to want to do it with me and I do such a good job at this massive discount that I increase the trust they have with me and now they have one foot in the door we're not giving away partially done work we're giving complete work to a narrowly defined problem that once completed opens up the next problem for example you do massage and you're like I can't get enough massage clients well it's usually because you're not giving enough free stuff away because fundamentally if you give something away for free you almost always have demand for it and if it's good you'll have exponential demand for it if I give away a 10 massage to get people to come in and then later everyone buys packages of massages from me or buys a massage subscription from me the massage subscription or the massage packages are my core offer and the lead magnet would be the trial offer of the 10 or discounted massage the reason people do those discounted massages they give those trials they give those Mini offers the lead magnets on the front end is because they they make more money because if I go up to 100 people and say hey let me give you a massage for 100 bucks a lot of people might say no maybe one person would say yes now if I then said to the same other people I want to give you a massage for ten dollars I might get 20 people to say yes and then of those 20 get a third of them to buy the hundred things after they tried my massage and so you've got one person getting a massage for a hundred dollars versus six people getting a massage thirty percent of the twenty after giving them that first trial and so my cost to acquire them is the cost of delivering the lead magnet so if it cost me ten dollars in cost to give the massage then I break even on my lead magnet if it actually cost me 20 I might lose 10 bucks but am I willing to lose 10 bucks on 20 people so I pay 200 to get six customers that convert and are worth two thousand probably even if your lead magnet costs you money to deliver it should still lower your total cost to get a new customer that's the secret that's the sauce of lead magnets and why they ultimately make businesses more money and why big business owners think long term about I'm willing to give more up front because I know I'll make more in the end you might be wondering why I just caught a football it's because I'll be hosting the Super Bowl of Entrepreneurship on Saturday August 19th where I'll be releasing my new book 100 million dollar leads the second book in the series after its Big Brother 100 million offers which is 15 000 five stars on Amazon sold at 400 000 copies off word of mouthful and the only reason I'm making an ad is because I talk about ads in the book and I want to prove that I know what I'm doing if that sounds at all interesting and you want to be there but you would why would you not want to go to the Super Bowl click the link opt-in I'll see you there a lot of people get really afraid of giving away free stuff because if I give away all this value then what do I do it's like give more value and if you don't know how to give two types of value then get good enough to be able to give value on the front end before someone buys so they can get value on the back end one of the beautiful things about business and life is that when you solve problems you create more problems if you're broke being broke sucks when you have money taxes also suck now you may prefer those problems but they are problems nonetheless what we want to do is always know what the Journey of the customer is going to be ahead of them and we should because we're the ones who've done this 100 times and so we should know what next problem is going to come up and if we put our thinking caps on we say hey well if there's six steps to this problem why don't I solve the first two and then they're going to counter problem three and then I make that my paid thing now I completely solve problem one and problem two but it naturally leads itself to problem three which I can then charge for so for example if you're trying to lose weight there's a lot of steps that have to occur and the way that I like to think about this is before during after for everything that has to happen for a customer so a customer wants to lose weight then they're going to probably have to eat better work out better and they'll probably need some sort of help along the way in terms of accountability to keep them on it right eat better but what does that mean well they're going to have to buy their groceries differently prepare the food eat the food the food's gonna have to taste good they're gonna have to get the right macros it's like oh wow there's like a lot of little things here can I say hey how can I make grocery shopping easier here's a list here's a pre-loaded instacart grocery list for women who are at this weight women who wear it this way women who wear it this way men wear it this way with this goal right and you're like wait that's a lot of those it's like yeah but it's one time work that you can set up for a hundred different types of people and then they have their grocery list for you now that's just problem one What if after that what's the next problem they can have well they're going to bring it back and be like what do I do with all this [Â __Â ] how to clean and prep all of the food that you just bought in under 60 minutes and I'm going to solve it for them then what am I going to do well how to store it and Portion it in a way that you can bring it with you so you don't get that weird jelly in the bottom of your chicken breast Tupperware which is nasty as hell stay pumping there by the way uh to increase the weight if you solve them very well people are like oh [Â __Â ] but I also need this and you're like aha well I want me to tell you about that since you got such a good experience with this one and because I had value I will have a prediction a future value because you provided me value before I bought now one thing that a lot of people are afraid of giving away is stuff that actually costs them money but I can assure you that if it actually costs you money it usually will be valued at a significantly higher percentage to the marketplace so sure you can have a free pdf sure you can have a digital video series whatever it is but normally unless it's exceptional people aren't going to value that because that's what a lot of people do sometimes giving away actual free work that you will incur cost on a lot more people will take you up on and if you do the math you will ultimately make more money and this what I'm talking about it's the difference between small business owners and big business owners they can incur calculated cost Upfront for a much bigger back end your free stuff should be better than their paid stuff everyone makes that quote but they don't actually do that what your competition actually builds as their core offer and you do such a good job of it that you can give it away for free then you become Unstoppable and you're like wow that takes work duh also soda's becoming a multi-millionaire so did you think it would be easy let's round this out with the seven quick steps that I think through when I'm actually trying to create lead magnets for any business that we have step number one figure out the problem you want to solve and who you want to solve it for if you know who you're trying to solve it for you will name it differently you'll approach the problem differently you'll Market it differently you'll package differently and ultimately you'll deliver it differently if you're very clear on who and what number two is figure out how you want to solve it so inside the book I talk about three different ways that you can solve an actual problem for a lead magnet so one would be like if I give a free assessment of any kind I'm revealing a problem to somebody a different way would be giving a trial of something they are usually more problem aware they know their back hurts and so I just need to solve it for them but unless they keep paying me it'll come back and there's other versions and you can combine them which I talk about more in the book you figure out how you want to solve it the third step is figuring out how you want to deliver it there's lots of different delivery mechanisms do I want to do it with information do I want to do it with a service do I want to do the physical product that I'm going to send them that demonstrates it all of these are different ways to deliver on that one promise and the question is which of these is going to be perceived as the highest value from the Prospect and increase the likelihood that they ultimately buy for me the most that would mean that you get the most amount of people interested and the most amount of people taking the next step then it's like okay well how am I going to package this thing the first thing that someone's going to see in order to make the decision to consume your lead magnet is how you package it so for example this book I had the title that I tested I had the sub headline that I tested and I tested the image that I was going to put on the cover itself well the first test I ran was 100 million dollar advertising versus 100 million dollar promotions and advertising one 69 to 31 I was like huh so then I ran advertising against 100 million dollar leads leads one 58 to 42. I was like huh then next round I said okay 100 leads or 100 marketing and leads one again and so I was like all right well leads is going to be the headline of the book couple different images that I ran and then I ran different versions of the event that was the one that ultimately won and so there's a story of a book that uh that went out on on dating and it tanked and they went back and they changed the cover of the book and the headline nothing else inside the book and then it went on to sell over 10 million copies just by renaming the book you're gonna put all this time in delivering an amazing solution and so if there's ever a most important step it's this one which is how you name it and how you package it so step five is making it fast and easy to consume people learn in different ways have an audio version have a written version hardback version they can hold their hands have the digital reader version have the video version on my last book honeybellio offers which now is I think 350 000 copies sold so I have a decent data set it's almost a perfect quarter quarter quarter quarter split in terms of where people consume it it's so much effort to write the book and so little effort to just double and triple in quadruple how many more people consume it simply by making it available in more ways to more people in more places six is you have to make it [Â __Â ] good the reason I say that is because so many people give away sucky fluff in their lead magnets and their free [Â __Â ] and I use [Â __Â ] as the emphasis there because they're afraid or unable to give away more value if you're afraid of giving away more value consider the alternative you give away sucky fluff 99 of the marketplace only consumes your sucky fluff and makes a decision of how much value you're going to give to them in the future and they're going to say oh he gave me sucky fluff why would I ever work with him and then here's the shitty part they then other people are like hey do you know Jason so-and-so and you're like oh yeah I could tip one of his things it was [Â __Â ] and so what happens is not only did this person not buy they actually get other people to not buy yourself who otherwise would have you can reinforce your reputation in the marketplace by continuing to over deliver to people who will never give you money and that's okay because they know the people who will if a lead magnet is not good enough that people then tell other people about it in my opinion you have failed put 100 into something if you've never put more than 10 put 100 in and see what actually happens to the quality of the work you put out in your audience will appreciate that because people can tell quality and step seven is that you want to make it easy for them to take the next step alright this is so important and people forget about it it's like we do all this work and we forget to make it easy for them to tell us that they want to buy more when you're making call to actions don't be clever be clear just say go to Amazon search my name and you'll find the book go to my website acquisition.com watch the videos be very clear about what you want the people to do and if you want give them multiple ways to do it it's the same concept as making multiple ways of consumption but making multiple ways for people to take action just like the book consumption you can double and triple your response rates on ctas by making it available in the way that is convenient to them is their preference some people like phones some people like typing in the URLs some people like scanning it just depends on the person and you want to make yourself available to all of them and believe it or not we covered about 20 of one chapter of this book I'm gonna have a big launch party for my book and if the book's already out either way it'll still be the same URL which is acquisition.com forward slash leads go there and it'll either be a training or there'll be a registration uh for the biggest event ever it's gonna be awesome I will do everything my power to overlive like crazy for everyone to attend so you can be there or be square\n"
