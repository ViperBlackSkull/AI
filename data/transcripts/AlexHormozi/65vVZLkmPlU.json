  "transcript": "I was a Management Consultant at space cyber and intelligence for the military before starting a gym how does that translate well I learned a Consulting process and the learning from Consulting process is learning how to solve problems because the Consulting process you go to experts and you ask them what they do so I started interviewing all these gym owners because they were willing to talk about the gyms and I would drive out there every weekend because I had time and I would just spend time with the gym and I'd be like how do you onboard people what do your contracts look like what terms do you use I would ask all of them and every once in a while some going be like oh I do that like that's good I'll take that one down I'll steal that from me but I got that from Consulting other gym owners didn't apply Consulting for because they weren't Consultants first so if I had maybe started straight into gym ownership right out of college rather than taking two years to be a consultant I might not have gone as far what felt like a complete waste of time when I was in it which it did might have been the thing that made me succeed in the next thing\n"
