  "transcript": "number one thing that you can do to make any website or any email convert better take all the text on the page and put it into a reading editor there's one called Hemingway app I recommend it and continue to edit all the words until you're below third grade you don't even need to change anything about the meaning of what you're saying just continue to edit it until it's below third grade and put it back in and test it and I virtually guarantee that your conversion rate will go up without even changing what you say only how you set it\n"
