  "transcript": "I was having a conversation with a famous YouTuber who is known for sacrificing all of his time and doing everything like monk mode no girlfriend and he called me up and he was like you can maintain your muscle mass without working out that much why do you work out so much shouldn't you be taking all that extra time and working more on getting to a billion dollars the answer is no under that same assumption okay well then having kids is something that's going to make you poor but with most people if you have kids you make more money part of that is because you have more mouths to feed so you force yourself to make more money the other reason is that if you think all the way at the top of the wealth pyramid look at besos look at musk look at Bill Gates look at Warren Buffett every single one of them not only have one kid but multiple children if it were true that having kids or working out were something that we're going to cost you well in the long term then the people who are at the top of the pyramid wouldn't have those things which means the premise is false you do have to work to a certain point and then after you have a certain amount of work that you are able to put in the leverage or how much you get out of the work that you put in becomes the big multiplier\n"
