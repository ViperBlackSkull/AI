  "transcript": "my dad told me when I was 19 and I had a terrible reputation and I was asking him I said hey how do I change my reputation how do I get these people to think differently about me he said why don't you stop acting like an and your reputation will catch up with you and so what I started doing was acting the way that I thought I wanted my reputation to be and the beginning no one cared they treated me the way I used to be but when the way I was behaving was different than what they were expecting the way they saw me started to shift and it took about 2 years for my reputation to change but I was really dedicated to doing it for me rather than doing it for them and then eventually my reputation caught up\n"
