  "transcript": "but Charlie's net worth was only a few billion dollars and I say only as though it's not a lot of money of course it was but he could have made a lot more if he so chose to but he said over and over again that he never wanted to make money he just desperately wanted to be independent because it's so easy to get caught in the race of more of just always wanting more and never having enough and I think the single greatest thing that I would say I observe from Charlie was that he knew when enough was enough and that he' accomplished his objective which was to be free and independent and to just do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted with whomever he wanted\n"
