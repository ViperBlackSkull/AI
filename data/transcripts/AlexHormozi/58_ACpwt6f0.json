  "transcript": "I don't take many vacations but I do travel all the time to work and to work from I would rather change my backgrounds and change my environments but still run the same day more or less and that gives me a lot of the stimulus that a vacation normally does just the change of scenery actual true days off we tend to Layla and I take when we need rest and so if we feel burnt out we will take the day to recharge and then we will work but we work as much as we can not because we have to but because it's what we enjoy doing most when we rest it's what we enjoy second most to working we only keep our work to rest ratio based on our personal needs\n"
