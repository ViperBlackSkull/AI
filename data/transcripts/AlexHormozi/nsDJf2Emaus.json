  "transcript": "one of my favorite sayings in the world we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never question at all I love catching myself on a belief that I've always had that I believe so thoroughly that I never actually thought to question it because that's how much I believed it it's just been there and so the higher up we go the more we kind of uncover these beliefs about what's possible what can we do how can we grow how quickly can change happen\n"
