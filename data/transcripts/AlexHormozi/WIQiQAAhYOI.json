  "transcript": "I got this from my dad he said I only play games if I know I'm gonna win people might take a lot of different things from it but I'll tell you what he meant by that he wanted to do all the preparation and have all the unfair advantages he possibly could before taking the first step into a game and I would say that that's probably the biggest difference between people who are big time winners and everyone else is that once you learn the rules of the game then you learn how to stack the deck and you can do it ethically and you can do it legally easy way to stack the deck wait longer than your competition you can come in with unfair advantages simply by measuring success on different time Horizons or measuring a different metric for success I think that that lens can be used by most people and most people don't do that because they don't even know the rules of the game that they're trying to play\n"
