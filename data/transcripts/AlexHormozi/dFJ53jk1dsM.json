  "transcript": "I take things to the Natural extreme so if someone says I texted you you didn't text me back that means that the entire world can communicate with me and then I owe the entire world a response like taking it the actal end if I got a million messages every day I physically couldn't respond which means that I then have to prioritize who I respond to and so if you do it at a million messages a day you might as well do it with one message a day cuz either way you're going to have to prioritize it and so it's just most people don't have enough Demand on their time that they pretty much just respond to everyone but you can choose to draw that line wherever you want cuz that whatever point you deem as enough time for messaging is the time that you start prioritizing\n"
