  "transcript": "one of the biggest breakthroughs I had in gym launch my first company that we sold for just under 50 million dollars was that in the very beginning I actually didn't call it gym launch it was called gym rescue and when I called a gym rescue and I started calling people and saying hey do you want to work with me I'm Jim Rescue all these gym owners were like I want to be rescued like I'm not a damseling Express and so I thought Bar Rescue I would just copy the same thing but that wasn't the case at all I had to switch from gym rescue to gym launch and then all of a sudden I'd have the same phone call and they'd be like oh yeah you can launch my gym and then I think to myself I was like your Gym's already open we're not really launching it but because of how we packaged the service the reception of what we were selling increased dramatically so whatever you're doing in your business if you can think of a way to package it that edifies the prospect that makes them look or feel cool or give them status as a result of doing business with you you will sell more people\n"
