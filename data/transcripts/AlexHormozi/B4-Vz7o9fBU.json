  "transcript": "if someone asked for a discount even if they don't ask if you seed that you want them to refer business to you say hey by the way you might not know this but my business is majority referrals and so this is my price for you right now but if you can send me two other people who want to do whatever the thing is that I'm giving you right now I have this price and this is what 80 or 90 of my customers actually pay you can buy this now and I'll rebate you back this in terms of extra work or I can give you a straight check whatever works better for you and also give your friend a discount as well so they're not feeling like you're pimping them out to just save yourself money they're actually getting a discount tip\n"
