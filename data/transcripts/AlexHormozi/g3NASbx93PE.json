  "transcript": "should you be dating if you're broke I dated when I was broke I dated when I had money I mean I think dating is a human thing and people shouldn't date when they're broke then the entire developed World wouldn't procreate I think what you need to look for is somebody who believes in you more than you do and that's rare but you only need to find one if you keep that bar really high you can go on lots of dates all with the intention of finding somebody who's really going to try and go where you want to go and they want to get there the way you want to get there and I think if you can do those things you'll ultimately find the right person\n"
