  "transcript": "quitting drinking for two and a half years made me more money i stopped being hungover i stopped spending money on all the things that i would go out and do i stopped making the mistakes like getting a dui and saying that i shouldn't have been saying when i was drunk and all of those downside risks got mitigated and so what ended up happening is i just had a smooth growth curve which normally before that point i would grow and then crash and grow and then crash and that solved the problem for me for good\n"
