  "transcript": "the next time someone you work with says I'll get it to you by end of week just slap them or just say that doesn't work for me because if my companies we say  a week instead end of day is better and so if you make the default in your business that end of day becomes the new end of week you move seven times faster as a company which is crazy because if you need to do a project and someone turns it around a week and then they turn the next thing around a week next person turns around a week what took 21 days can take three days in your business and the opportunity cost of how much more every single project starting earlier would have made you that compounds is what creates breathtaking growth and so if you define power as the speed with which a thought becomes reality so God would be omnipotent and as he thinks it becomes or it is then the shorter the gap between when you want and when you get becomes the more powerful your business is\n"
