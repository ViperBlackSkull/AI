  "transcript": "picking customers that are already successful is a form of Leverage so for example if I were to help a company go from 10 million to 20 million I could charge a percentage of that now realistically even getting a company from zero to one million is harder than getting a company from 10 to 20. and if I were to charge the same percentage of that growth from a company going from zero to one I would be making what I make in a day in the company going from 10 to 20. and so choosing to pursue opportunities where there's already proven success is one of the fastest ways of becoming more successful deal with winners and you will win more\n"
