  "transcript": "rather than putting my cash in a bank account I put them into treasuries because either way while I wait to decide what I want to do with the money you can trade in and out of them very quickly but the way that I do it is a little bit unique and so rather than say I'm just going to buy a bunch of T bills today we buy tivo's that are due in six months 12 months 18 months and 24 months that way every six months I have treasury bills with interest that come due and then I take that money with the interest and buy one 24 months out so you end up creating a nice cash machine that you actually get higher Returns on the money over that period of time with the same low risk that treasury bonds afford you that always be cash bank account anyone can do this\n"
