  "transcript": "hate only comes from below it never comes from above in my entire life it has never come from above and so if someone hates on you just take that as mental note of the fact that they're below you and they concede the fact that they follow you and as a second point to this if someone can hate on you who's below you and get you to respond it means that they control you they are in control of your actions so if I want to control this person and I want them to do something I will do this and they will immediately respond how week does that appear\n"
