  "transcript": "what's the theory behind starting a second C second at Big Cat of course how could I how could I [Music] [Applause] forget I have started with calvs for more than 10 years now uh straight and the reason for that is because calvs are my weakest body part uh in terms of like proportions isn't this nice it's something it's meant for two it is kind of cute system it is kind of cute yeah that's great so I actually train my body in reverse order of weakness wouldn't advise it like my reverse order of my like worst body part to best body part okay if you go ground up legs Wise It's like your calves are nice and warm and then I do hamstrings next yep and so our knee joint's going to be like nice and loed up so that when I actually do a leg move I feel pretty good when I put them first and then I doubled the amount of volume and I did them in every workout rather than like two times a week um that's when my Cal started to really grow I think that there's something definitely underrated about starting a session with a real low investment movement it's like no one's ever going to say no to another set of car phrases I really don't want to train today yeah well stand on the edge of this thing you're actually converting me you're actually converting me I mean like I've been doing this for 20 years so like like i' I've done iterations I've been doing this for 10 like I haven't I haven't changed it cuz it's like it's right I've had say that you do just one body part each session M and just consistently get volume in is that still the same 100% I don't think that many people have the same approach to training that Alex does not many people begin their workout with like a 100 repetitions on Cs and not many people do the exact same routine every single session full body have you ever ever had any temptation to do a different training modality uh functional thing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu thing CrossFit thing nope no design none I did my my experimentation way earlier like when I was in my like 20s I was like I'll try CrossFit it I did all body weight for 6 months I did only swimming you know what I mean um I did only CLE Bells I did that per year I didn't know anything so I started from absolute ignorance and so I would read these sales letters for like kettle bells and I'd be like oh kettle bells are what I need to do and then I'd read a new ebook about like how body weight training was like the new thing and I would just do body weight stuff and then I'd read about isometrics is actually where you can get the most strength and I would do that and so I I did all sorts of programs and methodologies uh for a while before I kind of like actually learned the few things that matter I wanted Max Muscle uh least headache I train full body every day so like body composition Wise It's the best for me I can do supet so I don't have to do cardio oh and you gain the most muscle so like why would I want anything that's not the most muscle yep and that works for me good but hamstrings after this will feel great yeah cuz your calvs always get involved in hamstrings so it's like prefatigue the calvs and then it'll only be hamstrings yes pref faue calvs and hams and it'll only be quads right yep very nice ham chop you want to do seated or lying we'll do seated chop no I would always if I was ever doing seated hamstring curls I would always superet them with uh like extensions always because for me I'm like why wouldn't I why wouldn't I why wouldn't you well why wouldn't I cuz then I'll be out of breath but I thought that the super sets I thought super sets were cardio if I was trying to get in better shape today's not cardio day in between sets is is is camera time understood and when camera's not here it's rest time why Lean Forward you'll see so lock it down as much as hard as you can on your knees like extra there you go so lean forward and put your chest up see the stretch now leaning forward even more yeah arch your arch your chest more so the stretch of your hamstring to catch you there you go it stretches the out of it like this and then also keeps tension the whole time on your hamstring yep so you don't have any rest whereas if you're back here right you're now yeah yep it's way pumpy that way but this made this like got my hamstring so much better than leaning back yep Big Stretch big squeeze Big Stretch big squeeze multiple gym memberships within the same city so good because you get sick of training in one place or you're in a different vibe kind of the same as the working thing at the desk change your environment yeah so if I need to prep for a guest I go to Gold South Central it's nice and quiet no one ever hassles me if you want to get session in with the boys there's a spit and swust indoor outdoor thing that's really cool and then if we want to do some functional classes on it got a gym really [Music] good good man o ymy YY if you really want to with yourself Point your toes forward now try it oh that's awful oh cuz it shows you how much your cap gets involved yeah you flex your cap can't use it yeah it's crazy how many variants there can be of one movement where you think I'm totally locked in but then if I go here and then if I go here but then if I don't go here totally different yeah crazy it's actually a cool mechanical drop set that way so you start with your toes out yep and then you basically go neutral EAS yep yep yep but I usually just go limp feet so like not this way which still helps you y this way like which takes it all out I just go neutral dangly dangly feet dangly feet I've always preferred training with a partner I think especially after a long time in the gym a decade and a bit you end up just running out of juice I just don't have all that much motivation when I'm on my own I'll go in and I'll go through the motions but if I'm going to push myself even remotely hard I need someone else there or else you end up scrolling Doom scrolling on your phone or getting distracted by emails or something what yeah [Music] boy it's funny cuz people in the gym are going to think we're Fitness influencers but we're not all of these videos have got nothing to do with the Fitness in fact the fitness is just a break from recording content yeah shouldn't they be in better shape why aren't they bigger I ask myself that every day why isn't he wearing a supplement company's apparel what's he acquiring yeah what is he acquiring isn't he acquired any muscle yeah why you acquire some gains bro it's like ideally you want to walk it like right above your kneecap yes and then it stabilizes the joint come on dude yep all right that's it for me that cool that cool this is one of those machines where three plates could be impossible or three plates could be absolutely nothing yeah it'll be between those two extremes that's my promise oh feel can you try and touch your hamstring to your butt now there's a little bit of rainy SL I think he's a little puffed up K we tell you about this so I'm trying to make puffy a thing yeah yeah I'm all puffed up oh my legs are all puffed right now o how many vest Brands did you need to go through before you decided on the one that every acquisition doc thing is printed on you mean this uh particular vests yeah tank top okay yeah yeah yeah um probably 30 or 40 okay yeah what were the most common problems that you encountered with other vests if you get 10 mediums and they fit different there's not consistency there it's one two they shrink differently where am I here here and then that out yeah this turns out and then hands here different ones shrink at different uh sizes when you wash yep um some of them were like too thin up top or too thick up top yep some of them would Bunch so it kind of like float like this above the actual softness of the of the shirt cuz sometimes it's just like it just feels like paper so I look for like softness oh too thick I guess yeah and then some of them don't stretch at all so I need a little bit like elastic in it so it shows all the good hides all the bad you know what I'm saying um those are the big I actually have a list on my phone for like all the things I was rating them on but those are off the top of my head good I'm still not done my shoe test I'm on like shoe number probably 50 and what is it that you uh a lot shoes are the toughest by far you think it has to be able to get me into a nice establishment yep I have to be able to work out in it yep it has to be able to get wet cuz I don't want to have like a different shoe when I'm traveling that gets wet y my feet Can't Sweat in it and they can't smell over time yeah that's hard and you don't wear socks I don't wear socks yeah that's difficult I mean that's a high B just that just that is a high B yep yep and I be able to work out with him like doing calf raises and also like and I have to be able to walk in them with no like blisters anywhere yep and I walk an hour every day are you puffy puffy I'm very puffy okay good would you be able to get into a nice establishment in in those trainers do you think yeah the only thing I've ever seen at the nicest places is no sandals it's just too many Rich guys where yeah normal you of the red sneaker effect right what uh there was a study done at a conference with businessmen and they tried to quantify the objective metrics of how smart somebody dressed and there was an inverse correlation between the smartness of dress and the net worth or the job title that this person had so it's the people who had dressed down the most that had the most wealth checks out counter signaling is a hell of a drug man I mean usually I try and rest as little as I can between sets that's the strange thing about training with a partner even though you have to wait for someone else to finish that set yeah you you rest less you rest less because you've got uh cuz you're not on your pH timer and the timer is the other person's set I'm about 50/50 uh in terms of whether I train with people or not uh there are seasons where I like find somebody that like we have a times that work out for a season and I work out with them and then there's times when my schedule's kind of crazy and I just get workouts when I can um I would say that I far prefer working out with other people whenever I can just because I I train harder I train longer I do more sets I probably do better form um and I and I I just in general work out harder and longer when I have other people around me yes like Optimal two to one yeah I would say that that's probably not and that's exactly what it is it's two two parts rest for one part lifting I would say there's two different types of training sessions so there's like a training session where you're like going in there to die and remove your own soul and look at it like deep into its own eyes and then put it back into yourself um and then there's training sessions where it's like I would say a more social training session uh and to me that was like a more social training session so I still got a workout in but like I wasn't dying if you want sneaky cardio 90 minutes of pickle B is 1,000 calories it's insane and you don't even think you're just like you're just chasing a ball you're not doing cardio you're chasing a ball a, calories on a concept 2 ski or or something miserable yeah my dear hell so that goes to what Trevor was talking about where the people who are the quote most disciplined aren't actually more disciplined they figure out something to do in the meantime so it's like you did the same cardio as the guy on the ski he gets off he's like I'm so disciplined and to you it didn't feel like discip yeah like the opposite right so I think like their in lines are pretty big find # find your pickle ball find your pickle ball and then get puffy on it I I don't stop trying to make puffy a thing Puffy's not going to be a thing oh it's going to be huge big puff Chris and I have a good Dynamic um on the podcast and off the podcast I think we um very bro talk uh so it we keep it light which is nice because you know life can be really serious all the time and it's it's ironic because he has a podcast on like wisdom and deep philosophical things and it'd be really easy to take yourself seriously and I'm glad that he doesn't and uh and he can talk with me what say you think we'll do one more just in case you know the rule if you have to ask if you have if you have another set left you got a do another set what if you more more ear you want me to see there yeah because the machine Mak go up yeah so if your feet are too much well and up that's going to push you up so like you go more wide just like this and more wide you're going to be more a to fill all this part made for all right that's what we're doing little bit more high and more white too this the corner yeah all right here yeah o all that doctor yeah all right open this yeah yes yeah I see one [Music] more yep [Music] yep hey why you got to listen to Pros baby the greatest hack of all time whether it's bodybuilding or business is getting with people who are far ahead of you um I mean almost all of the periods of my life where I had huge changes or improvements in my physique was when I had people who were better than me giving me Insight because the thing is it's like you can learn a certain amount but like if someone has a decade of experience on something and then they can just immediately spot like even if you're a video editor someone like oh dude you missed this you like they they have more context to give you advice um and it's invaluable which is why I've I've tried to buy any experience I can from anybody who's willing to sell it to me I'd rather get the lesson without the scar all right let's shoulders yeah there nice seated yes oh yeah the uh post quad stretch for Max pump brutal my quads are on fire right now what's the keys here any oh so do this right before we start your shoulders like forward not back forward so you where do you want to have them sit as far out as you can yep got you okay nice most be a smaller metor and rear ads so I pretty much just exclusively train medial and rear not even train front not my deficiency not my constraint not my [Music] problem [Music] come on yep so I would like to enter into your shoe rotation Van's old school comfy Kush but I think them today I think they fail on smell yeah and I think that they fail on getting wet it depends on how wet wet From Below fine wet from above not good so they have a new one that came out that has cork bottom and it's mesh on top so it's meshy like this oh I've seen them they're called like the move I was wearing them today underneath the table I didn't no I didn't notice good so far they they haven't failed any tests but these are better to work out in got you slip on slip off if you've got a shoe horn shoehorn no you're red pill on shoe horn no come on you ever have to fight to put your shoes on these are stretchy but what about the vans that was a downside for them I wasn't a Fanon and you bypassed that's expanded your choice it has landscape by having a shoe on I usually only do slip on slip off how much do you value the skin on the back of your thumb probably quite highly I would imagine extremely high yeah arguably the highest skin most valuable skin really oh yeah really think about ah lots of people in America are circumcised AR they I forget yeah I'm probably the only person in this building with a four skin that's C we'll cut that one from the re just like he got see what it did there question for you yes who's your favorite person to interview who's the F your favorite interviewer interviewers Rogan the guy is so good it's all about people from the outside will see someone that's got a very successful platform but his use of cadence and silence in a conversation is unbelievable I thought I've worked very hard at this done 600 episodes I get to S sit down with this guy and it's like being a a black belt and going no I get to roll with the seventh Dan let's see how good he actually is and you're like what the was that very very very impressive like super impressive interviewer that's cool terms of people to interview one person that I love consistently is Rory suland oh okayy he's so fun super easy very knowledgeable very knowledgeable um something about seeing a guy double fisting Vapes throughout the entire episode one of which is on a rope around his neck so he'll have one on a rope around his neck so it's never more than a foot and a half from his mouth at any one time and uh Stills legendary how's this feel shorer wise good yeah that's good it's a a quite a weak angle like you know if you were here you'd be way way way stronger but it feels like it's that kind of um given that you've done 3,500 hours yeah of writing yeah what are the main principles that you rely on to remove friction from the writing process what are the water desk setup time like well not everything and in terms of like the writing got it um I mean I I pretty much just write the same time every day which is when I wake up and then I write till noon and that's basically the only thing I don't do anything else yep but you're using I saw you use nicotine today during the podcast I did that all time though so that's not equal opportunity very good je it's task independent yeah yeah so I guess the lesson from that nicotine a global reward what's that it's a global reward you can do you can use it to reward anything something tells me that you and Rory are aligned on this come [Music] on oh cheeky little drop set go on then yeah cheeky little drop set oh there it is get those so the rule is sit down and write that's the rule it's not even a rule that's just like when I do it no but that's your strategy your strategy is sit down and write I'll say this my strategy is do the thing that's most important first okay and for now it's writing and then it'll be something else later yep so that that's my I would say the macro calendar is the bigger thing I don't take meetings until noon or 1 and then that first slot gets switched out with whatever the priority is yep understood do you take a break during writing during that 6- hour block to have like a shake yep half the time I do it while I'm writing half the time I take a break if I need it yep okay but not long 15 minutes interesting was it more difficult before you were in the editing phase in that there's a maximum number of ideas per minute that you can put out onto paper so you have to kind of sit and think what I'm actually trying to do or say here I say it's more phases so it was more like figuring out what I'm going to say first that's what the longest then was writing it which took which was the easiest yep and then basically taking what I wrote cutting out half of it filling in the other half cutting half of it again filling in the next half cut it just basically just continue to just compact compact compact compact the book's probably 270 pages but it got compressed from 1 th000 plus yep and just like the rule is always like if we read two sentences is and if we only read one of them it still meant the same thing one of them is not required and we just do that over and over and over again yep so that my hope is that the whole book is literally tweet after tweet after tweet for 300 Pages you read the almanak of Nal rabant yeah yeah kind of like that right very dense High signal to noise this one's going to be a bear cuz it's basically like eight books in one which sounds ridiculous to say but like it shows how to do warm Outreach cold Outreach post content run ads hire agencies hire hire recruit train train manage employees build uh affiliate programs build referral systems in one book and so like each one of those 25 to 30 pages was probably like a 150 page relevant book yes that just got squeezed until there was nothing left we could cut and it's like if you read this you will know how to set up Affiliates if you read this you know how to set up a referral system if you read this you know how to get your first five clients for more rage outs if you read this you know how to post content to get customers was there anything that you had to write that you didn't know um yeah all the time I have like my best ideas of like this it's usually I start with anecdote of like this is what we did this is what worked well and then that's what Trevor and I will beat up until we're like what are the principles behind a good referral system and then one doesn't and then we'll try and break it and be like all right was the one that worked that didn't have those things and we just that process is what takes the longest yep because we want it to be valid yep and that's the hard part yes cuz it's very like every marketer has their system in their head and they write it down and they send it but you can immediately break it which is why it's not valid which is why it doesn't get shared why it doesn't become Canon so the goal was like if I can make something that no one can disprove then they become Canon and people can use it so first one was offers yep second one's leads leads third one is fourth one is I have a couple ideas but for now the next book cool there'll be more yep all right um last set one more all right if you have to ask all right we'll do um we'll do a double drop okay so go 10 10 10 cool all right yeah I think that was what I was trying to get at today with that bridge between the philosophy and the applicability yeah and that because in the world of business a great philosophy that doesn't make money doesn't matter doesn't matter yeah the validity of the model is how much money you make correct right which means that a beautifully sounding theory that isn't effective in the real world is pointless ah so everything that you're talking about has being stress tested well we just start with what worked and then we try and figure out what makes it work always yeah so it's like Affiliates we're like how much do we pay them on what Cadence and do we have tears and what do they have to do to earn the tears yep how do we activate them how do we get them to keep marketing [Music] so this will just bother all the fitness people but I try and do as many perfect reps as I can and then I try and do as many imperfect reps as I can and people are like isn't that going to only strengthen a certain range how I see it is I fatigue all the stuff that I can at max range and then I keep going until I fatigue the stuff I can do partial range so just for me it kills it more and I get more volume in per set I'm definitely not an expert but for me once I'm here this is the end of my delt as I feel it everything above that for me is trap and I get these crazy pains in my neck so I have a nice stop sign CU I feel a shooting pain but for me I can just do this and know that that's the end of my delt and so that's the range I train but plenty of people disagree with me and they're probably rip and smarter I think it was I think this was like when I was training classes at Huntington Beach this was a hot song so I heard it like 40 times a day I'm sure when you were clubbing there's just songs like umbrella correct right correct given that I listen mostly to either like British rap or metal neither of which get played in nightclubs all that much I knew the words to every single song that was in the top 40 for a decade and a half what of metal all sorts dude Bring Me The Horizon what about hard or dad metal what hard or dad metal Dad no not Dad metal give me a break this one arm yeah one arm yep I trying to lean my hip out so you get a bigger stretch you'll see are you on under yeah I'm under under here here here yeah and then just wedge yourself yeah you know you asked me earlier about do I remember this name of the song that was playing yeah I don't know the name of any song Like lyrics for sure it's kind of a crazy claim I don't know the name of any song I'll say it this way like me recognizing a song by name is very hard for me and I listen to that for what do you think that says about you I have very bad audio memory my wife will attest to that wouldn't it be great if you have absolutely great audio memory and forgetting all of these song names it's just one long troll really bought in keep saying forgets the name of Rihanna the only song that I know the full lyrics to was one that I had to write out in seventh grade they were trying to teach poetry and they're basically saying look songs are poems like you know whatever and so I remember the eve6 song that I wrote down and that was it and there was like you had to find similes and metaphors like in the in the thing wow that's it this the only one I know the lyrics though cuz I I could read it funny come [Music] on there you [Music] go I actually think that this bag is a very good physical representation of your life philosophy I think it's incredibly transactional it's like just does the thing even if it's not what it was designed for it actually does it better than something else might do it again just stinks of horoi doesn't it absolutely reeks of horoi um zero Aesthetics uh very functional uh odd it completely disregards convention how many things did you go through before you tried this oh plenty yeah different types of bags different types of setup rolly bag and you settled on that a workman's bag yeah also lasts forever but it still had a bunch of issues with it so I ended up modifying a bunch uh to the bag like cutting things off and like moving stuff around um but what I have now is the best you know gym bag that I know of and uh it kills yeah midback smokes it oh uh other things that I've had to learn since I've been in America biscuit uh isn't a biscuit no not a thing biscuits a cookie for dogs biscuit is like a scone that goes on the side of beef yeah at Cracker Barrel yeah piece of bread yeah Fu a piece of bread chips or it's a dog biscuit in which case it's a treat for a dog fine yeah chips me like thick french fries yeah they're not no very difficult assimilating into this new culture has been incredibly difficult for me and I spent Fourth of July here which was emotionally quite a tough day yeah anyone comment uh I wore a t-shirt that said uh happy treas and day ungrateful colonists yeah yeah um was it and then people were like winers right history do you see any backtack world war Champs no that's funny yep [Music] yep oh yeah oh that smokes is one of the problems of training with Alex somebody who has a very dialed in gym routine that for him he doesn't train his chest doesn't train his chest because he says his chest doesn't need to grow anymore some of us don't have that problem might have been nice to done some chest today but look and I'm in his town for the back titties the back titties it's a big back back puff big back puff oh stop trying to make puff happen Puffy's going to be huge stay puffy all right make sure that chap sticks nice and secure in case something traumatic happens during these Bice that's the that's my sunstream that oh see interesting yeah and here look you see the pocket for it on the side oh no meant for it it's meant to be all right so I just move them forward like 2 in and then you get the full stretch yeah it's just significantly harder and you get a mean Pump am I doing it right doesn't give a he's busy it's like I'm busy being bigger than busy being massive am I doing it Sor come on here yeah yeah right there tight did before you go fight up woo spicy very spicy that's right kale who's bigger am I bigger am I bigger I don't know I don't think I get my leg up they have good legs Bo just because normally you have more water on the L Body theer more what you have more water the theer don't [Laughter] do all right so how do you how do you not stay egotistical if people bigger than you I feel like that's like a perfect microcosm of what we're talking about yep corre correct [Music] correct come on just catches up come on come on oh yeah 20 lbs never felt so heavy it oh yeah humbling oh yeah it's just not heavy enough at that cuz like you can do adult raise with 20 so like this angle it's like not that bad there you go back more there it is money reps okay yep must be nice like I live for the day when fashion has developed enough for guys that I just need to wear a single piece of material in the gym I I hardcore considered it overalls cuz then it would like eliminate so many things from my life I mean if you if you had I kill the only thing so I'd have to find what do you call the uh the girl version of that a romper yeah it' have to be a jean Romper cuz I want the short version I don't want the I get hot I give a go Lea would probably Revolt but I would continue anyways because she's more attracted to the fact and I what she thinks that's a really interesting point it's an interesting point that something that your wife would prefer you doing is less attractive than you not doing the thing that she would prefer you doing because of what it means to her yes correct correct just preaching the gospel here of personal of personal uh personal brand what we call it personal identity there you go PR brand of authenticity it's like the inverse of the test you know like test so  test was this thing that came up during pick aarts history that girls would like give you a a challenge of some kind or I bet you're not actually that strong in the gym or I bet you don't actually have that job I bet you don't drive whatever the whatever the thing and that was a test yeah and it was uh the same way that some female frogs will uh fight with males to test their strength before they actually decide to sleep with them okay and uh would be like I'm ready this feels like the reverse of that this is like she's she's testing you but the actual outcome that's optimal for attraction is you you reject her you reject the test entirely yeah you punk the game yeah cuz I feel like I was thinking I was like what would I say if some girl was like you really don't make what you say you make I'd be like okay I just like be like I'm sure you have somewhere I probably wouldn't even say that I would just say okay and keep talking to whoever I was talking come on dud I just love these reps they just feel so good come [Music] on oh yeah there it is big squeeze the largest squeeze dude I'm getting puppy I can feel it my arms are puffed I'm like 3/4 puffed not full puffed this is a public service announcement Alex stop trying to make puffy a thing it's never going to be a thing and it makes me uncomfortable every time that I hear you say it can't even push back back against it you're like what are you pushing back against I'm like well pushing back against you're saying that word what word yeah the p word yeah don't say the p word there you go all right let's put these back we'll do some tryceratops so fun fact I tweaked the out of my tricep like two months ago and then rather than take off I just went to the lowest weight I could on this machine because this is the machine I tweaked it on and then I've just been adding 10 lbs every week and now I I'm like back and it doesn't hurt it's the best way I know how to rebap keep moving but keep moving light just basically keep dropping the weight until it does like whatever the thing you hurt it on it's kind of like with gymnast they tell him to get right back on the pommer horse if you fall off so you don't like get up in the head about it so I hurt myself on this machine and then I dropped it down to like the lowest thing I do that didn't hurt and then I just add it back rather than being like Oh I'm going take like two months off or whatever I just came right back and did the lowest weight I could without it hurting so you like this it's a little lad at the top from that that boy is a little yeah I just try to maximize whatever the my angle of the like when to squeeze this it's not like cuz obviously you could do this yeah but it'd be weird in my opion yeah yeah it's more like how can I keep this angle as as acute as possible and then get it a lot of stuff on like warm-ups is not like super definitive it's like stretching there's like Bodies of Evidence on both sides that like doesn't help prevent injury blah blah blah so like I think it's more about warming core temperature rather than like each specific movement so that's why I do CS first cuz I get warm another reason I do CS first the Bulgarian Olympic team never warmed up they went straight to squats now it's more Testament to the fact that they pick the right people who wouldn't get injured training that way correct than it is a measure that that training is effective so here's something that's interesting a question that I had for you that's more about how you guys work with acquisition. there's a very common strategy that people use when it comes to growing a business that's in that kind of region yeah which is is bring somebody on board and then apply ungodly amounts of pressure to the founder just lean on the founder like and the presumption is that they're either going to crush under the pressure and if they manage to stick about the business by design has made three years of growth in one year what do you think about that approach I think it's actually dictated by the returns they promis limited partners more so than it's basically like we have to deliver these returns in 5 years the only way for that to happen with a VC model which is usually the ones that do that are that they have to spray and prey on 50 Investments knowing that one's going 100x and cover the whole portfolio in terms of returns and they can afford to have lots of losses so what's different with what you're doing we don't really think any of them are going to think any of them are 100x but it's not the model we don't we're not like a tech primary investor like we're much more what I would call everyday businesses like mortgage sales photography shops you know what I mean just normal businesses Insurance like that and uh for us I would rather have all of our businesses triple over 5 years get same or better returns than those guys do and not burn 49 relationships both work financially it's just also like how you want to live life and we are also like we're growth Partners but a lot of businesses don't require a win or take all model like Facebook one guy was going to get the whole social network so you have to do it that way but like mortgage sales one guy doesn't like there's no advantage to you're not going to take the mortgage sales Market you'll just keep gnawing away at it and there's a lot of businesses that if they didn't have that forced pressure would otherwise be good businesses even if they don't have an enormous Tam they can still generate really good returns not 100x returns but you could get a 10x and I'd rather take a 10x when I can get it than force a 100x and lose a 10x you know in the process given that you do full body every day do you cycle different exercises across the week not a fun do you do them across periods I train the same body parts every day y we did hip thing today if I'm feeling it I'll do that for a little bit if I'm not feeling it one day i' do a different leg exercise I just don't have a lot of rules but my point being that given that you want a well-rounded physique yeah for instance if you were to continue to do this you're never actually going to yeah I use like when I do back my break Alice gets hit yep and I will without trying overtime cycle things in and if I ever identify that I have a weakness like a clear visual weakness then that moves up in the workout like I'll I'll really prioritize otherwise I'm also kind of at like the point in my care like I'm not really going to gain any more muscle so it's just like I stimulate that keeps what I've got try not to hurt myself do that hopefully until I die that's my perspective how's your dad built physically uh like me but doesn't have like yeah yeah muscle muscle but you think you had a good genetic base yeah I think um so I was I heard about this from Greg Knuckles big big lifting guy some people who are who are naturally like big and muscular have low potential for growth but have a high Baseline yep some guys have huge growth potential but are tiny dudes genetically so people see people they're like dude that guy's a house like if he actually lifted but they're completely separate jeans interesting stay puffy\n"
