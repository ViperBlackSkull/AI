  "transcript": "having started software businesses before my biggest piece of advice here is that you need to have a software co-founder you need somebody who's a technical co-founder who will work day and night someone who loves code loves making products that people love if you don't have that person and it's like a third party shop or you're paying I can count on like one hand the amount of companies that have succeeded that way versus having a technical co-founder if you're trying to do this on the side and the likelihood that you really get to something that's massive is really low the guys you're competing against because there are guys who are probably looking at the same industry building a product right now that does the same thing they're well capitalized and they're Savages they don't have a side hustle it's their main Hustle\n"
