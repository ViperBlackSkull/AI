  "transcript": "so for a long time the prevailing idea in content marketing that shorts viewers got more people to watch Longs and then those long viewers would then translate into becoming customers right so people watch shorts and then they watch Longs and they give you money but again when we looked at the data it looked more like this shorts viewers watch more shorts and long viewers watch more Longs and so the point is that that these are different audiences and I will make a note here this can change my platform I might be a long viewer on one platform and a shorts viewer on another and where I do think the magic happens is where you can have shorts in one thing and so someone finds you on Tik Tok but then they are a Longs viewer on YouTube and then they watch your Longs there people watch differently on different platforms\n"
