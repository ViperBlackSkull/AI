  "transcript": "so if you want to do a holiday sale of any kind one of my favorite ways to do it is you look at the components of the thing or bundle that you have and you Splinter off just a piece of it you give the splintered version for 90 95 off that leads to the purchase of the other products in tandem in a bundle if there's three coats of paint that you have to put onto a garage door give layer one off for 90 because they're still going to have to buy two and three but in that way you get lots of leads and you can still make sales while competing in a very heavily discounted Marketplace\n"
