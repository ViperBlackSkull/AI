  "transcript": "the way that we train sales a lot of people train Rapport building first they train the script top to bottom but if someone knows how to do the first half of the script and they don't know the second half of the script the likely that they can close is zero if someone doesn't have Rapport and they don't know the opening questions but they know how to close the likel they could close is greater than zero my belief from a selling perspective is that only time you actually make a statement is when you sell the vacation then after that you ask objections happen time money fit each one of those we always loop back they give us the thing we overcome it and we say great so now you're ready whatever the closing question is soon as someone says yes we stop selling\n"
