  "transcript": "my favorite Frozen is Orange Leaf I believe that they have the best flavors I think the founder of that franchise or whatever it is actually loves dessert you can tell by the attention to detail by the cookies that they bring in they're always fire they're so good the flavors themselves are decadent they don't have all these weird fruit things it's just like caramel chocolate peanut butter you know what I mean the good stuff that is my personal favorite of all the different yogurt stores and if you haven't been to an orange leaf you should check it out they're very good I was not paid to say that they are very good though\n"
