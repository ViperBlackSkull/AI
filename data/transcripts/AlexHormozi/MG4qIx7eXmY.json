  "transcript": "I had a different Mentor later in my life who said never create work around your passion because then it'll become work and he was a guy who's a very successful business guy and I think about that actually more than I than I share because it's just complete and utter because it assumes that what you're going to be doing every day is the thing that you're currently really interested which also doesn't make you money and so your behavior has to change and whenever you're doing these new things one they'll be new which means you will suck at them which means you'll probably not like them but it's also part of it and so like I would prefer to take the extreme opposite position of everything will suck and eventually you will get good at the things that you suck at and then you'll enjoy being competent at that thing which will then probably give you status and you'll enjoy the fruits of status more than the pain of doing the thing and in so doing create a positive feedback loop that you'll actually keep sticking with it\n"
