  "transcript": "most guys who are starting out are thinking there's something wrong with them because they're not passionate if we consider passionate requirement to be successful I just don't think it's true I think you need fuel you should use whatever fuel you have what entrepreneurship is about as being resourceful we have different things that have fueled us in our lives and I would rather have people just use what they have my singular message is use pain because most entrepreneurs don't need to look very far to find the pain in their lives\n"
