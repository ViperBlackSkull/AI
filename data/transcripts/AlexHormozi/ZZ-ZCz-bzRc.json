  "transcript": "people sell courses right it's really just a fractionalized way or a diluted way of selling a skill it's like a risk adjusted skill if I were to actually guarantee that you knew how to run ads like me you should take loans out to get that you just don't know if you can so you buy a fractionalized version where I give no guarantee and you may or may not get it but if you can get training to be so effective that someone walks away with significantly better skill they will want to buy another skill out of the library of skills which is pretty cool\n"
