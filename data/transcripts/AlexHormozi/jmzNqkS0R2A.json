  "transcript": "I Define love as what you are willing to endure to keep something it's like man he must love that car because that thing's a piece of crap he won't get rid of it he must love that somebody loves his kids they go they pick him up at work they do all these things for their kids and they're not getting anything back the extent to which you're willing to endure is the extent to which you love something and to the same degree you can think about the dark side of that people love their addiction which is why they're willing to endure so much pain to keep it for me I so desperately loved and desired to be successful because of my own past that I was willing to endure everything short of death to get there\n"
