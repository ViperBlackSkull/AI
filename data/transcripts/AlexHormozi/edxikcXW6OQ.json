  "transcript": "my favorite way to tell whether or not I want to buy something especially when I had less money was I would translate the price tag into how many hours it would take me to make the money all of a sudden when a shirt looks like nine and a half hours you're like I don't know if I would do it for that or a pair of shoes is a day and a half or two days of work all of a sudden I'm a lot more hesitant because I think to myself if a boss came to me and was like Hey you get these new kicks but you got to give me two days of work I don't know if I want to do that and it was one of the strongest Behavior changes I had in terms of controlling my spending\n"
