  "transcript": "you are the work that you've been working on this entire time and the fact that you can see what you were doing before was not nearly as fruitful as it could have been is the progress that you are making it's not that you are failing it is a sign that you are on the right path you don't have hardship if you're not moving forward the fact that you're in pain means that you are growing which is why they call them growing pains and part of that becoming better means breaking the old self that you had into a thousand pieces and feeling every single crack that has to happen and then watching the new fresh skin come underneath of it strong longer and thicker than before\n"
