  "transcript": "privacy is the cost of Fame and for some people that cost is always too much for me I'm not really that different in private than I am publicly so it it didn't seem like too big of a deal second is it's irreversible once everyone knows who you look like that's it you can't stop and uh there's like small social costs like you know if I walk outside of the house I'll get recognized four or five times and that's fine or if I go to dinner with Lila I'll probably have to stop three or four times during the dinner to take pictures and that can be disrupting and the hard part is you always have to be in the best mood ever because this is the one time that this person will ever see you and they will make 100% of their lifelong judgment and tell every person they ever meet how you are based on the 30 seconds of how you interact with them and then 10 minutes later you do it again\n"
