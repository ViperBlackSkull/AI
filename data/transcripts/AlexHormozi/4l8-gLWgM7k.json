  "transcript": "if I know someone deep in their core of what their intentions are I can tell them anything I know someone inside and out and then someone says sell this thing and I know nothing about it I could probably get them to buy on the flip side I know everything about this thing and I don't know who I'm talking to and so a lot of people talk like hey sell me this pen when in reality what we want to do is like talk to John the majority of good sales trainers who try to do that gimmick what they want the person to do is ask them a question and so if they say sell me this pen what you do is you take the pen and you put it in your pocket and you say how's it going what brought you in today cuz I got to go from where they're at to wanting a pen I'm not going to just be like hey buy this pen give me money like it doesn't work that way but bad salesman do\n"
