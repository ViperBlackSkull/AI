  "transcript": "I want to say this to anyone who's listening if there's anything you listen to all the stuff that I described that was really tough that I went through was not as hard as me quitting my job by far the hardest decision of my entire life Bar None because the things that I was actually caught up with were the opinions of other people opinions of my father and the opinions of the people that I went to school with who I thought would judge me for leaving this good job to probably become a failed gym owner and how lame that would sound compared to consultant going to Harvard and blah like I was going to go from Peak white collar to a very blue color you know profession making significantly less because I quote loved it and I'll say this again but like sometimes you have to let other people's dreams for your life die for yours to live and for me it was like when I continued to every day not want to wake up that was my wake-up call it was the hardest decision in my entire life by far\n"
