  "transcript": "big big Star Wars guy most Star Wars games that came out personally I was the Knights of the Old Republic guy I beat that game like 25 times yeah Darth Revan favorite Sith of all time Darth Revan was like the king badass and then in Sith law you kill your master to become a master Darth Malek who's the primary Baddie after you escapes the ship while you're being boarded by Jedi Knight so you're like cornered by like 20 Jedi Knights and Masters and so then he fires on the ship as he escapes to just kill all you know 20 enemies plus his master now mind you don't know that first part you wake up disoriented you know the classic like here's your sword and then you find out later because then like Malik confronts you and he's like you don't remember Master and then like you have this flashback and it's like it's wild but the Jedis try and reprogram your mind because he's like he's so powerful if we could only use him for good and then you have the choice of like become Master Jedi and save the world or do I kill Malik and Conquer it again just the force powers for lightsider so lame compared to the dark side Powers it's like if healing and like Shield so\n"
