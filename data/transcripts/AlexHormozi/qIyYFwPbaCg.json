  "transcript": "I have had many mentors in many coaching programs I would say that I differ from the vast majority of the talking heads in the business space and that to my knowledge the only one who came up through that world like you look at Andy for Sally you look at my life you look at Gary none of them came up through learning stuff on YouTube going to seminars going to coaching programs I did so I'm a huge advocate for alternative education and paying for skills as fast as you can\n"
