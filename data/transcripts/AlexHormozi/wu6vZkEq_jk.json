  "transcript": "the people who have the least also have the least to lose which makes them the most dangerous competitors because as soon as you have something you become more risk averse you can't take the same gambl like I don't take the same gambl now as I did when I started why cuz I have something to lose but if you have nothing to lose then it's basically like life giving you a scratch off lottery ticket and you saying you don't want to scratch it off because you don't want to lose but they're giving you the lottery ticket for free because what happens you get the lottery ticket and you lose and where are you just as poor and still having nothing just like you did before but in that one ticket out of 20 or 100 or a th000 tickets which is phone calls reaching outs knocking on doors sending cold emails whatever that lottery ticket is you can get one yes and it can change your life\n"
