  "transcript": "I've got a friend who runs an accounting firm his accounting Specialist or horrified by the fact that it answers tax questions with 95 accuracy so what happens with all these people who used to do this for a living it can do it immediately and cheaper and better the IRS did a study on this they sent out one business 20 different accountants and they asked them to file tax returns all 20 tax returns are different so it's not whether it's right or not it's just how right is it and so if it's right enough then it can replace a lot of work\n"
