  "transcript": "there's only one person who knows what I am capable of and what resources I had at my disposal and whether or not I left it all on the field and so that bar continues to raise because that man knows and so my goal has been to make that man proud and that is enough and so that is what I seek to do and by doing that or at least making that decision it's forced me to do fewer things because you can't do many things that well and put that much effort because otherwise you'd be spreading yourself too thin and so with that level of effort as the new bar I have to be very strategic about the few things I decided to dedicate my time to to make it worth doing and so that's been kind of the big unlock for me\n"
