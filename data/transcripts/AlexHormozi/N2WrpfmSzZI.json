  "transcript": "my recommendation is do not promote in the content ever so think about it like this is that you want to have this big valuable thing all this content that you're teaching the ctas in my opinion in content are not very effective they kill reach it feels weird no one likes it whatever people will naturally just take the next step if you put it in the descriptions you put it in your link in BIO like you do those two things you will get traffic to your stuff by just saying this is what I do rather than hey by the way like I just I don't think that's the right way to do it where the magic happens is where you build all the Goodwill for free and then you use ads to do the ctas and for whatever reason it protects the brand it's a totally different vibe if I was like right hooking every video be like hey go to here go to here go to here people would be like who and then that that would be it like no one will watch my stuff anymore but if I keep providing value they get value I deposit Goodwill and then later we can hit them with an advertisement to go do something\n"
