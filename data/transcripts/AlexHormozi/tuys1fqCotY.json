  "transcript": "I really don't like the Alcoholics Anonymous concept of every morning waking up and saying I am an alcoholic or whatever because what it does is it puts it at the Forefront of their mind they literally label themselves every morning is having this problem when somebody who's not an alcoholic just doesn't think about it they don't think I'm an alcoholic I have to fight not drinking every day they just don't think about it I think it's exiting the equation altogether but then wouldn't you get just people not caring at all yes yeah and there are different ways to take that some people see that as very very self-serving which it might be but to the same degree like you are released from the chains of the expectations of others if you can exit the equation of like labeling yourself and then just doing because what else will you do while you are alive it creates some levels of Freedom that allow for clarity of thought and also for the ability to take risks that most people can't take\n"
