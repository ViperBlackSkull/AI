  "transcript": "people don't get the amount of volume that it takes to be successful I had a mentor when I was starting my gyms he was like we do Flyers that's how we get customers and so we put out 300 flyers and I waited and then the next day I got a call I was really excited as soon as I picked up the phone he says you uh dinged my Mercedes and I just immediately panicked and hung up the phone but that was the only call I got from my 300 flyers and so I called the mentor back I was like hey you told me this was gonna work he was like how many did you put out I mean I put out 300 in total and he just started laughing he's like hard to know if anything works with 300 he's like we test with 5 000. he was saying 5 000 and then he said he would go to 5 000 per day after that meaning that in 30 days he put out a hundred and fifty thousand flyers in that same 30 days I put out 300\n"
