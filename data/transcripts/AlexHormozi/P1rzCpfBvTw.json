  "transcript": "so there's two big reasons why we're not public about the Acquisitions number one me endorsing a company with five 10x the company overnight if I include a brand endorsement then I own majority I'm not going to risk my face on something I can't control the second thing is that if we were to exit those businesses and I had done an endorsement in a minority position then guess who has to go with the deal me our whole goal is to build value in the business so that the business is sellable and more valuable and we use my face to bring deals in and so that's why I've been really really tight-lipped about the businesses there are probably some companies in the future that I will probably endorse I'm still waiting for the right no strip company to approach me\n"
