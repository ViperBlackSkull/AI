  "transcript": "people watch videos on the internet and they take the advice and it's the wrong thing to do they don't understand that there's two components to advice and when you're a beginner everything that you get for advice usually leads you in the right direction because anything is better than nothing the problem is the more advanced you become it's just like driving a NASCAR when you're going two miles an hour you can make an adjustment and doesn't really swing the car very much but at 200 miles an hour a slight hair off and the whole car blows up when you are more advanced the advice needs to be more nuanced it has to be the right advice for you specifically in your context and it has to be at the right time and so you can have the right advice at the wrong time and it makes it the wrong advice how can I take this make it contextual to me personally and to where I'm at in my current Journey\n"
