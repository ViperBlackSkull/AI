  "transcript": "let's say you and your buddy are thinking about asking a girl to prom but he's like ah man I want to ask Nicole and you're like all right man why don't you go ask her it's like what if she says no he's like well then you're in the exact same position you are now which is you have no prom date you will also have no prom date but you'll have experience of asking one girl what happens when you talk to the next row you'll probably be a little less nervous and you probably realize that you'll survive you will live if you hear a no and if you ask 100 girls do you think one of them will say yes to your prom date probably and in that situation what are you now better off than you were before you asked the moral of the story there is that you lose nothing for no you only stand something to gain from yeses and one yes can change your entire life if you're willing to be rejected and see the rejections as you learning meaning you win and see the yeses as you also winning then you can't lose\n"
