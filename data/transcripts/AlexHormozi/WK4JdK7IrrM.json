  "transcript": "I'm going to explain to you the diaper marketing strategy that can make you rich some retailers figured out that every single person who has a baby usually buys diapers you give this away at a loss as in even less than it cost you break even or losing money so that you bring more people into your store and then once they come into your store you can sell them ancillary products that have way more profit margin if you have a service you itemize the list of all the things you do and then you peel off one of those and say hey I'm going to make it 90% off even if you lose a little bit of money it's okay then say by the way aren't you going to need this and this aren't you going to need baby bottle aren't you going to need formula aren't you going to need whatever you make up the profit with way more customers\n"
