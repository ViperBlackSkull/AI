  "transcript": "if someone comes in and I can tell what season they're in if they're in the earning season I will work you like a mule because I know that this is the only exchange if you come in and I know you're in a learning season and you've said I'm in a learning season then we will be so generous with how much we can give and reinvest in you because the exchange when you're coming in and I have to pay you above to get you to come here means that I have to extract more value from you than I pay you that's the fundamental of business like if I don't extract more value you can't be here\n"
