  "transcript": "most books written before the 1950s were written because people would end their career and that would be their contribution to the field they would say like this is my 30 years of work and I've put into a book to move the field forward that then started to come with status then people were like maybe I can just write a book and get status and then they started shortcutting it and then the buried entry to getting a book published got lower and lower and then when self-publishing started anybody can publish a book and so I think books overall have decreased in value tremendously since they were ridden the old way with the old intentions\n"
