  "transcript": "in my opinion 100 of anyone's money should be invested in only one thing which is increasing the earning capacity that's it A friend of mine has a daughter she's 17 years old she got a job at a bowling alley she was making minimum wage I think it was like 750 whatever he's like why don't you just uh get a phlebotomy certification it's a weekend and you immediately make 25 an hour and so people think about that I'm like guys it's 500 in two days it's a weekend to get a phlebotomy certification and forever she will have three and a half extra earning capacity for the rest of her life and so if you take that same thousand dollars and put it in the s p maybe it goes up ten percent maybe it goes up 25 because that's a crazy year right well cool you have 250 extra you could have 250 extra per week just by investing in that one thing where you get a 50x return or 100x return\n"
