  "transcript": "a lot of Us wish that we don't have problems but problems are constant and sometimes they are a sign of progress because if you solve a problem then you create another problem so if you solve your marketing problem what do you create a sales problem if you solve your sales problem what do you create a customer success problem and so it's called the never-ending cycle of problems and solutions the idea is that we're wishing for something that will literally never happen we want to live a problem free life but instead in my opinion we should try to choose which problems would you prefer because absolutely are better and worse problems\n"
