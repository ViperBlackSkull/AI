  "transcript": "the worst practices that are used on a sales team actually come from not doing much at all it's super sporadic there's punishment all the time there's not enough praise for doing a good job it leads to more churn of sales guys but most of it is just lazy sales managers they don't want to give feedback and they don't have hard conversations until it's too late and they just surprise fire people all of those things create a culture of lack of trust and at the end of the day the sales manager's sole responsibility is a culture of high performance\n"
