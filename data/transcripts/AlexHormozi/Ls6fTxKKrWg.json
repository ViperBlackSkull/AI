  "transcript": "I saw this tweet by Elon Musk and I thought it was so perfect I'm paraphrasing he basically said being an entrepreneur is always getting what's left over after everyone's done their job and then there's the really terrible thing that no one wants to do guess who gets to do that you the the steaming pile of terrible conversations that you have to have those are yours no one takes those for you and whenever there's an unknown circumstance like we've never seen this before guess who gets to do that you and guess who gets to mess it up and think about it for the next 5 years also you and you just accumulate these scars until eventually you see a second one that reminds you of one that happened 3 years ago and you're like ooh I will try something different and hopefully this time it sucks a little bit less\n"
