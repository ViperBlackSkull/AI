  "transcript": "I think pain moves people far more effectively than pleasure does the easy thing to wait to prove it is point a gun at someone's head and you have absolute compliance and they will do what they need to do automatically just like that like death is the great motivator and the gun just reminds you I'm a big fan of future casting out negative scenarios so people talk about like positive visualization I prefer negative visualization which is what if I keep doing what I'm currently doing for the next 10 years will my life look like then that usually takes my current pain and then just magnifies it that allows me to get my action threshold high enough that it goes over the edge so that I can take that first move and so if you know what the inputs outputs are of what you need to do and you figure out whatever fuel you've got not the one you wish you had but the one you've got and you use that to do the first input you've crossed the line you're in the game\n"
