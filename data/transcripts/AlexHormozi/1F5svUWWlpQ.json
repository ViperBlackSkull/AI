  "transcript": "let me show you two examples of two companies one company is super volatile and it has big years and low years and high years and profit swings a lot it's only been around for 2 years and on the other hand you've got a company that's been around for 10 years and has grown at 10% a year and they both in this year are the exact same size which company is more valuable this one the second one and the reason is because you have a high degree of confidence that it will continue to generate profits into the future and ideally grow in those profits and so we think about all the different ways that a business can go to zero and think how can we prevent all of those from happening\n"
