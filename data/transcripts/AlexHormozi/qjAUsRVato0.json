  "transcript": "there's an unbelievable scene in Ted lasso where Nate his former Protege gets on the camera live and talks a bunch of  about him and says that he's an idiot he doesn't know what he's doing whatever fast forward to the press conference where they're asking Ted lasso and he handles it perfectly he says oh man Nate said that about me man he could have said this he could have said this he could have made fun of my accent he could have made fun of he's like cuz I sound like yany doodle over here he just keeps on breeding himself and then the whole crew of newscasters just start laughing because there's nothing else to say now if he had then attacked back then it would have become this whole drama but after that it's done we can claim all the things they could possibly say against us and then at that point it dissolves the conflict because conflict only works when you have two opposing forces if you have alignment because you're agreeing with them there's nothing to push against\n"
