  "transcript": "I could have a lever and try and push up a car and I'd have to just keep going as many times as I can but the longer the lever is the more Force it's going to push on the other side yes I have to be willing to push the lever up and down but the length of the lever is going to be a far greater determinant on how much strength the force is on the other side of that thing you have to be able to work but after you know how to work it's about what work you do and so the equation for output of whatever it is whether it's muscle whether it's money whether it's relationships whatever it is the equation is volume of input times leverage equals output\n"
