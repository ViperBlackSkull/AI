  "transcript": "one of the most understated things that I learned from Charlie was that despite being one of the best investors of all time I think the thing that made him one of the best isn't necessarily his financial return there are other investors who have achieved higher returns than he and Warren have but Charlie's net worth was only a few billion dollars and I say only as though it's not a lot of money of course it was but he could have made a lot more if he so chose to but he said over and over again that he never wanted to make money he just desperately wanted to be independent he said he just overshot and I think about that a lot when it comes to what things I'm optimizing for because it's so easy to get caught in the race of more just always wanting more and never having enough and I think probably the single greatest thing that I would say I observe from Charlie was that he knew when enough was enough and that he had accomplished his objective which was to be free and independent\n"
