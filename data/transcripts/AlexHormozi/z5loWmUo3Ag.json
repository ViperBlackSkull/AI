  "transcript": "think of brand like a bunch of flowers on a table if we don't put them together it is just a bunch of flowers now as soon as we put them together we create an association and so we create a bouquet but the bouquet never actually existed like it's the same three flowers the bouquet only exists in the fact that we have Associated them together and as soon as I put them back on the table the bouquet disappears and that is how ephemeral brands are it's only based on the association that we make what's interesting about this though is that you can change how the bouquet looks if it was all roses would be a much stronger rose bouquet than having many different flowers in it so now let's play a game a dead flower if you hand a bouquet with a broken or dead flower on it it ruins the whole bouquet R Kelly despite all the Roses he has I'm being real has a very serious broken flower and no one cares about the rest of it interesting but if we had an entire Hotel full of roses and one broken one Michael Jackson everyone's just willing to look the other way for the broken rose\n"
