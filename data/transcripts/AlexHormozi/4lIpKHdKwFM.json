  "transcript": "the work needs doing there's no way around it it just has to be confronted it just comes down to that and a lot of people put a lot of extra things between them and the work that they try and romanticize they try and create superstitions around it but like at the end of the day the work doesn't care who you are it just cares that it gets done in a fitness example 500 pounds is 500 pounds it doesn't care who you are it just needs doing and I think that a lot of people waste a lot of time not starting\n"
