  "transcript": "like I've only seen two dynamics that work in relationships over like an extended period of time one is We're In It Together and the other is like cheerleader and quarterback but the thing is is for me I know personally like I had two very long relationships that were cheerleader Dynamic and to me I could not imagine living life that way having now lived what I live now because like there's a certain amount of shared respect that you never get with somebody who does not know what it's like to be in the battlefield or in the arena and if I'm like I need to work for the next three days and like write five book chapters it's not a discussion it's like course do you think there's no like I can't believe you're like into the flip side in the cheerleader Dynamic a cheerleader who's really rooting for the team doesn't ask the quarterback to come out when the game's on the line and so I think that a lot of people are running in what they consider to be cheerleader Dynamics but they are inverted Dynamics they're actually sabotaging the game in that Dynamic it's harder in my opinion to do the cheerleader quarterback because you have to have a very aligned mission and goals of like the relationship\n"
