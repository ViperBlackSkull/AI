  "transcript": "happiness is a really tricky question wanting to be happy is in some way saying like I want to eat a meal so big I'm never hungry again it's a misnomer I think that the idea inhibits or prevents a lot of entrepreneurs from continuing down the path is that they are like I'm not happy I prefer to use the word Joy but I feel like Joy is a lot more internal and you can be in the thick of it and working on your auto detailing business on the 37th door of that day and you have a little tick mark and you know you got to get to 100 and you had the last 36 slammed in your face but like you can be joyful if you reframe the joy around the person you are becoming by doing the hard work\n"
