  "transcript": "I had a bad reputation in college and the reputation was that I was a Flander and was you know all about girls and whatever I wanted to not have the reputation and so it wasn't like I was going to go talk to those girls and be like I need you to recant your story I had to make my actions so much louder that I was no longer going to be that way for an extended period of time to counteract that thing if we're thinking about like how to respond to people being shitty to you if you believe what they say and it's true agree and one up if what they say is something that isn't true but does bmer your reputation then you can only respond by being louder with the truth\n"
