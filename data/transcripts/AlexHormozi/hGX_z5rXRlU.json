  "transcript": "so you want to get shred in 2024 well you're going to need lots of exag testosterone and to pick better parents but if you're not going to do either of those things I've got 12 protein packed recipes that require zero Time Zero prep have almost zero carbs almost zero fat and tons and tons of protein this loan has over 200 g of protein and almost none of the other macros and I'm going to show you this recipe at the end of the video first let's talk about breakfast Chef bro Rd to the rescue so breakfast the least talked about thing of the day was like breakfast champions for old people uh it's also great for gains so uh if you're somebody who struggles to eat enough like I do or if you're somebody who eats too much also works for you I'm going to show you how to make a 100 G protein bomb for zero prep in just a minute using stuff that you have at home that actually tastes delicious so number one I use this F yogurt there's plenty of other brands it doesn't really matter I use this 0% this puppy has 94 g of protein in it and just under 500 calories for this whole thing and if you have this this whole thing it is spilling and for people who struggle with dairy yogurt tends to do a little bit better than somebody who just drinks pure milk cuz it's already turned so already has some of those metabolites and all that fancy stuff that I know nothing about that being said I do know that if you eat that compared to drinking gallon of milk that's easier on the stomach now we're going to take something that's all natural and we're going to ruin it with lots of artificial flavors so that it's actually delicious and you can use a bowl what I usually do is I just put it in here because I don't like dishes and I will take fruit punch I like Berry personally uh there's different ones there's like a berry sangria that's pretty good and the nice thing with this is that these are always available everywhere so if you travel and you usually have your Main Stays at home you're like shoot what do I do like almost every grocery store nowadays has has Greek yogurt and so I put about half of one of these guys in and this is like for a pitcher so I figur this is about half a pitcher of fluid so I put half of one of these guys in and then I mixy mixy mixy now if you do need a bigger bowl cuz it does make it easier to mix just for visuals I'll show you guys you put this guy in that looks great and then we just mix this guy so this is my prep time can we start the timer here's my prep time you also get a nice little forearm pump so you get a little pre-workout workout if you know what I'm talking about what's cool about this is it actually smells like Yokai or Danon or any of your favorite uh you know yogurt yogurt brands that we know and loved when we grew up and then later found out they were made by big farmer to kill us and all that stuff anyways I like Fruity Pebbles so this is my preferred uh cereal of choice let's take this guy out and so here's the cool part is that this can stretch a really long way so a cup of this has 140 calories in it and 30 G of carbs pretty much nothing else it's almost all carbs all right so let me show you guys a fancy trick so leave the actual cereal scooper as one cup in there so that you always know what you're getting every time and and so for me I pull out my cup make sure it's even on the top don't give yourself a heaping scoop all right and then after that I know I've got 140 calories of carbs and so rather than mix them in because then they get soggy what I'll do is I'll sprinkle some on top doesn't that look delicious and then I'll peel off the first layer they stay crunchy and then I'll put the next layer on and then I'll peel off the second layer so I can have this nice Fruity Pebble crunch all the way through and you can see I didn't like I barely used a lot of my cup and I just did two kind of coverings worth and you can use like a cup is plenty you could do a half cup like if you're dieting cuz I've done this when I was dieting if you use a/2 cup of this it's 70 calories it's 15 G of carbs and this thing's 500 calories of protein with basically nothing else and it almost nothing else right and so that's my choice it's like this is a filling breakfast all right you put all this in here that is a filling filling breakfast it looks like a massive bowl of cereal except this has almost 100 g of protein in it it doesn't take any time to prep and if you eat it out of there which is what I normally do you don't even have any dishes let's see if it's as good as I remember it still delicious by the way if you do have a beard beard Nemesis so definitely check yourself in the mirror before you leave the house other you have pink all over your face that being said let's go to the next one by the way I'm making these recipes because the last video I did so many of you guys commented saying like give us a part two and so this is part two and we'll have the recipes in the link in the description enjoy so this was a lunch that I had for like a couple years because I tend to stick with the same thing for a really long time until one day I decide I'm going to have something different but this is an awesome lunch so this is Ezekiel bread which is just fancy organic schmancy bread that has I don't know less preservatives whatever it's in the refrigerated section it's like a dollar and a half more anyways so I had this stuff cuz I figured if I'm going to have it every day I try to eat better stuff so that being said take two of these guys and if you want to know per slice each slice of this thing is only 80 calories which is not bad for a slice of bread especially given how like weighty it is so some some slices of bread are like kind of foamy you could like mash it in your hand and put into a little itty bitty ball this has more weight to it so it's 80 calories it's got 5 gr of protein in it 15 G of carbs and almost no fat now if you like toast which I do there's speed toasters that can toast it in like half the time or a third of the time and every minute is precious to me so I have a speed toaster that I toast these guys in but just to keep this video rolling imagine these are toasted all right so once it's toasted what I do and I've experimented with different ways to eat this cuz I ate it every single day for like 2 years is I have fat-free cream cheese all right so this is zero fat cream cheese which you're like how does that even work honestly no idea it's probably some sort of Franken food it just kind of has the texture of cream cheese I think they use milk to make it who honestly knows I don't really care that much but it tastes pretty good the way to to do this guy is uh usually sometimes they'll have like little measurement things on here um if you have a scale because you want to be precise awesome I have done it enough times to know kind of like what a tablespoon looks like um and so that's about what that looks like and by the way these are lowfat locks again I'm a lowfat guy which means it's pretty if you have fish that doesn't have carbs in it and used to have fat what's left protein so this is pretty much close to the same macros as a chicken breast kind of cool um it is a little bit drier just to be fair but for me I didn't really care that much The Taste was good enough for me and that worked different ways you can eat it version one is you put the cream cheese on and you layer that on top I don't like that because the bread starts to get soggy the next way you can do it is that you can put the salmon on here and then bite by bite put the cream cheese on that way does work cuz it doesn't like the salmon doesn't really make the bread wet but the problem is that the Salmon's really hard to bite into cuz then you pull the whole thing off of the bread and so after eating this a lot of times I have some settled on the third way of doing it which is that I actually Mash this guy up into like salmon tartar all right so I just cut the out of this thing and I really I'm not even trying to like grind it up I just want to make it in big enough slices that if it comes like I'm not going to tear the whole thing off the bread when I eat it so that I like I still have salmon that's on there when I'm eating it all right tricks of the trade now once I have this now what I'll do is I'll take my cream cheese I'll throw this guy on I'll some with this on and then I just take my bite and I just do that over and over and over again and that has been how I ate it for years and years and years so the bread stays crunchy I don't have to accidentally eat half my salmon in one bite and then just eat plain ass bread the rest of the time and the cream cheese stays cold because if the cream cheese is cold and then the bread is hot they just end up being lukewarm and sucking and so this stays crunchy and hot this stays cold and creamy and then I have a bitable amount of s and it doesn't tear off at once and that is how I eat this thing now let's talk about macros real quick so remember this thing's all protein this is more or less all protein and this is low calorie so if you didn't want to eat Ezekiel I would just say go with low calorie bread I just try to minimize my carb intake unless I'm trying to eat them on purpose and so I pretty much just eat protein throughout the day and then when I am going to eat carbs never skip dessert I go any e carbs for real and I eat as many carbs as I feel like so like I said in the beginning I try to eat around 100 g of protein per meal and so I would actually do three of these guys and I eat them as open face sandwiches so I have fewer carbs overall and so I'd put about 4 oz of this protein locks on here I'd have my bread and I'd have two three maybe five grams of protein that would come from the cream cheese and so between the 20-ish that comes from this the 3 to four that comes from this and the five that comes from this I get about 30ish grams of protein per Open Face Sandwich there's my 90 if you guys are paying attention at home this is actually not enough salmon for what would be on one sandwich so the salmon gets stacked up because remember this is protein right so I'm going to show you this because this is aesthetically what it would look like at a fancy restaurant but in the brasic kitchen this is how much salmon would actually be on your sandwich all right so I actually tried to eat as much as I could on these open face puppies so that I could then get swo all right so there we go now I put it like this and I could take these massive man bites and have three of these guys but I didn't want to throw away pounds of salmon uh for no reason cuz those salmon give their lives for us like that boom delicious so I have three of those guys 90 g of protein all in calories 240 calories come from the bread probably 100 or two from the cream cheese and the rest is just protein coming from the salmon and if you have a beard once again so you don't look like you have a facial wipe your face delicious so we just crushed lunch now let's talk about snacks on the go so two of my favorite snacks that go on the go that you can eat pretty much anywhere in the continent in the United States are you got jerky and you got light key Point string cheese all right so let's dive in so you might not know and again this isn't for all the healthy people if you're going to be a healthy person then just go watch another video but if you just want protein this is for you all right now original jerky and I found this out lat here has a lot of protein in it all right so this is this little guy has six servings of 10 g of protein there's 60 g of protein in this there's less than 500 calories not bad right so it's 480 calories 60 g of protein and so not a bad uh snack that you're on the way on the go so if you don't have time to eat or something like that but you are a bigger guy and you need more calories and if you're a smaller guy and need fewer calories just cut it in half all right now the other thing is string cheese now I use scoops of weight protein or pure protein sources as a good lipus test t for is this a pure or less pure protein Source all right so like if you have a like the purest version of this is that you have a 120 calorie scoop of protein it has 24 grish of protein that's about as lean as you're going to get in any kind of normal food now if you have four of these guys it's 200 calories and 24 g of protein all right so not I mean really really close and the added amount that comes from this is fat so there's 2 and half Gams of fat there's almost no carbs in this um in the string cheese and so if I have four string cheeses and this guy I've got 84 g of protein and you're like man four string cheeses and all that it's like yeah it's kind of like a meal which is kind of the point and so you can have this on the Go and all in all you'd be up 680 calories with 84 g of protein and the stuff keeps great so if you just want to like have a snack on the go and you don't eat 100 grams in one sitting you just open it up take a bite tough not all of them are good but that one's okay I'll bet you the string cheese goes down a little e easier cuz that's super dry and you canare this with a lovely Savon water and this guy though people were like how do you eat six strink cheese you got to like bite one bite two it you eat six of them honestly six string cheeses it's just cuz they serve these to like four-year-olds so like the string cheese is just not that much cheese it's like two bites so it's really just having 12 bites of cheese it's not nearly as much as you think about they just package it like so they can charge you more there's not that much it's this it's not a lot of cheese all right see there you go it's like three bites I'm remembering now while I eat this jerky and the cheese actually taste delicious together it's meat and cheese it's actually really good so this is for those of you who are just rich and feel like spending more money but still don't want to have anything but protein bring on the next one so I used to eat this when I was cutting so this is my cutting diet so this is shrimp that's been peeled and cooked already so you can get this from the freezer section or if you're really fancy you can get from the Fresh section I prefer the freezer section because it's cheaper so for all you fancy  boom shrimp which all you have to do is defrost it this came pre all what ever all right so you just let it thaw all right the way that I did is I just do it under the sink cuz it thaws it faster and then it just comes coldish and then you take this puppy this is to cocktail sauce which by the way has 30 calories per4 cup which you're not going to have more than like A4 a cup anyways all right maybe two all right so this is probably I don't know a/ cup maybe and so I got 60 calories of tartar sauce so all you got to do is dip one of these puppies in this is the fancy eating instruction herle B that's it very easy you can do whatever you want and the nice thing is that most people can unless you're allergic to shrimp most people digest shrimp pretty well and so the nice thing is that usually shrimp has a lot of volume and so it's very filling at least I found it filling and so if you want to be fancy you can do that and if you want to be a little less fancy you can have like 8 O of chicken and 8 O of shrimp or if you want to be a little bit less fancy but still feel fancy you can have 4 oz of shrimp and 12 ounces of other doesn't really matter it's all just protein but the cool thing about shrimp specifically is that shrimp has zero carbs and zero fat the thing is pure protein and so unless you add fat to it or you add carbs to it there ain't going to be any all right and so the only thing in this meal that has anything besides protein is just the cocktail sauce and this thing like a little bit goes a long way and I barely even count this stff when I was eating it so now that we finished our fancy fancy shrimp shrimp dinner dinner now let's talk about beef and cauliflower all right so this one is one that is a classic also one that I ate a lot when I was dieting because I needed to really get my uh my protein up and my uh my calories down but all I do is I have the leanest ground beef that I can find so this is 937 usually you can find 964 if you find a good place that does it just get that um you can also do it with ground turkey um it doesn't matter uh if you were really poor uh I used to just buy chicken breasts and then put them through a food processor which I had for my dog at the time and so I just feed them in and just grinds it up for you and I just have all this ground chicken breast and that worked pretty good for me so one is you've got your beef or your meat that's going to be lean two is you've got these microwavable packets of riced cauliflower all right now this stuff is heavy like it's very filling and the nice thing with this is that if you've ever had an uncle Benz or a quick or minute rice or whatever it works the exact same way all right so you just crack the top put it in the microwave and heat it up now one thing I will say is that the beef you usually prep at one point during the week so you're going to have a few pounds of ground beef already hopefully somewhere in your home and then all you do is you just got to add something to it so that it makes it into a meal and that's why this is a no prep deal now up to this point you're like okay so you're just talking beef and cauliflower like why is this a meal good point because that on its own would be disgusting and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how I make a sauce that is both delicious and not nutritious in terms of it's uh not chalk packed with macronutrients but it's actually just chocked full of deliciousness and not a lot of cows all right so let's put these puppies together and I'll show you the secret sauce and we'll enjoy it together so first things first we're going to start with the meat look at that cooked it already man we're Speedy who said this was Zero prep anyways so next thing is we got to take our cauliflower and we're going to Nuke this thing right so now we've got these two puppies so how we're going to make this delicious cuz right now this looks like dog food and I agree with you so we're going to enter secret ingredient number three the sauce so let's talk calories about mayonnaise all right so one first thing is that we actually accidentally bought the wrong one this should be light mayo most light mayos are about 35 calories per tablespoon this is this puppy now if you want to not keep measuring spoon by spoon by spoon which you can have lots of error you just put the thing on a food scale and just see how many grams it is it's a much easier way to do that but for the visual demonstration purpos of this video let's rock with it so if I've got 100 call it 30 calories that I want to eat all right in terms of fat I've got one of these guys and the reason that the the the weighing it is kind of useful is cuz you always have some kind of like leftover on the spoon and so you're kind of counting the same thing twice and so I like just weighing it but it is what it is all right here we go now if you also want a little hack uh use the spoon that you did the scooping with to do the mixing because that way you get to use some of the stuff that's on there that you had to get credit for in your calories all right so that's 130ish calories cuz each one was 35 * 4 whatever 140 there you go 140 calories all right fantastic next one is Hermos secret Special Sauce which is just Sriracha all right so then this guy I've actually I just don't count calories on hot sauce cuz there's not enough to really give a and so I put a little bit in depending on your desired hotness levels now I like a little spice to my to my stuff all right and we go a little mixy mixy oo you can even smell it woo that smells like heartburn yes it does you're going to feel that tomorrow yes you will okay fantastic now I take sweetness and add this in so this is Stevia if you want to use Splenda that works too all right now again this is like spicy and sweet are to flavor all right I like to add a couple in you'll get a feel for it add one in see if you like it and then add another if you're like oh I like this to be sweet cuz what ends up happening is when you put this whole thing together this becomes this really nice fatty sweet spicy mayo all right look at that it's kind of fancy right all right so check this out so we combine our forces together boom we've got our our rice and our beef and then we go mixy mixy again I'm going to give you another hack if you need to get sauce and you want to stretch it further instead of just like taking this and just dumping it in what you do take a little bit of this dip your spoon go on top and then take a bite that's it actually is really good so that being said that's how it works all right and I do it that way because you can you can you'd be amazed at how many more calories you can get if you just dip your fork or dip your spoon before you do it and if you're really clever about it I try to put the sauce on the bottom side of the utensil so that it's like directly on my tongue so it feels like there's way more sauce but there really isn't and so that's you can stretch 140 calories for a pound of meat so now that we just did a little spicy spicy let's do something sweet I'm going to show you the nastiest ghetto fabulous way to get protein you've possibly ever seen and it's so weird you're probably going to try it all right this is 100 g of protein in one serving with zero preparation of any kind this is the only food on the market that I'm aware of that you can literally take off the shelf get 100 gram of pure protein with no fat or carbs and it is egg whites now you're like well how are you g to zero prep egg whites well something you might not know is that egg whites are ultra pasteurized they're not even pasteurized they're Ultra pasturized which is why if you look at expiration dates on eggs they're like super far in the future because there's almost no bacteria in it all right now you might be like okay what is he going to do with the bowl great question actually we have this here so you can see it all right but this is how you do it and you're like wait Hershey syrup zero sugar yeah now you're getting where I'm going with this now if you grew up having chocolate milk as a kid which I didn't cuz my dad didn't want me to be fat but uh if you did good for you um I did get them at school though they had the little cards of milk you know those CR yeah I had some and that was like one of my big sources of protein ground anyways so what you do is step one take ultra pasteurized egg whites I call these tall boys all right there are 20 servings of 5 g of protein in this puppy that is 100 g of protein there are exactly 0 g of fat and exactly z g of carbs in this entire thing it is pure protein and then we take pure delicious where there's exactly zero g of protein and 0o G of fat in this and probably just gelatin and who knows what Frankenstein's piss anyways and so you take this all right and there's 32 servings in here and so a tablespoon if you remember what the Mayo looked like it doesn't matter because there's not that many calories in this anyways it's five calories per tablespoon all right so we're going to put some of this in here all right that's probably like 3 tablespoons 4 tablespoons all right and so what we're going to do is we're going to go mixy mixy either the way keep your finger on the top hear that mixy mixy you can almost hear the gains loading and you and that's it let's see this it's just like chocolate egg whites that's all it is and if you want to add more in you can but I will say after having drank many many many of these Pro tip drink 95% the last five is like kind of gritty so I would just like take 95 g of protein called a w um and the thing is is like if you had this entire thing for everyone at home who like wait how much did he put in there this whole thing is 150 calories you're not going to use the whole thing if you used a third of it it'd be 50 calories which I didn't even use a 20th of this all right so like it's going to be okay but you can make this thing as chocolate as you want so that would be an ex extremely chocolatey massive nonsense look at the texture here look how thick that is kind of delicious right look at that it's like real chocolatey this is uh a great way to start the day so you can knock out half of your protein in a single sitting doing this if you need 200 g of protein and if you just eat like a normal person the other three meals of your day you'll probably get 200 g while we're on the Chocolate Train let's keep it going all right so let's uh let's dive in so one of the things I didn't know is that Premier Protein actually make cereal there's some other cereals that claim to be protein cereals but let's be real they're not really protein cereals they just like a bunch of soy crisps put together that still have shitloads of carbs and fat but this one's actually pretty good so this is one cup of this guy is 180 calories and 20 g of protein which is basically the equivalent of a good it's like a little bit more than literally pure protein in a scoop and a little bit less than most protein bars so like really pure version of protein and so if we put a cup of this in but let's be real no one eats one cup of cereal all right so what we're going to do is actually have a protein breakfast of champions and have one cup wait for it two cups three cups all right so there we go you got three cups of this puppy this is 60 g of protein and then open up one of these guys make sure it's good oh yeah well this is from the uh this is a I think this is March of 23d three oo it's a great vintage anyways so we dump this puppy in there which I'm really doing for visual effect cuz what I would actually do is actually pour this in the bowl first and then put one scoop at a time in so I could keep the cereal crunchy but it's a little bit more dramatic this way for the visual cams all right and so we're talk about zero prep protein 90 g of protein like almost the purest amount of calorie per calorie protein out there um this is all way though so to be fair if you were somebody who doesn't do dairy well this would not be for you um but if you do handle Dairy well which I do um this is just this is a good time so this is 700 calories 90 g of protein and probably cheap as so if you're broke and you want some protein that takes zero time to cook and is delicious I throw this puppy on the list especially if you like chocolate you can handle milk enjoy if you're riding this br rasic Voyage with me then you will love this one too so this is a lunch meal or a dinner meal if you're kind of wild you can even have a breakfast cuz you're just a psychopath that being said all we do is we take this chicken of the sea can tuna which I think is my favorite flavor of tuna just cuz I like saying Chicken of the Sea make sure that you have it in water rather than oil so that there's not extra cows in it you can open this guy with one hand not really everyone uses two hands to do a can opener ask the disabled is that too soon anyways uh that being said this guy has 66 g of protein and only 300 calories ice cold all right so this thing has zero carbs basically zero fat and only protein so one of the nice things with most Seafoods uh especially Crustaceans this is not Crustaceans but but in general tuna is a very very lean uh protein and so that's why it's lean all right so that's 66 g of protein 300 calories that's step one in this puppy step two is we're going to take this F or Fage depending on how you want to say it all right take a 3/4 cup get this guy in here here by the way whoever invented these ones that have these little rims well done don't have affiliate links don't know what brand it is but if you find those then awesome on you all right we're going to put this thing here I actually already did this but this is a second take so deal with it all right that being said this is now in total 300 calories of tuna and 90 calories of yogurt so 390 calories but here's the cool part there's 86 G 84 g of protein in this bowl and less than 400 calories so let's this up with even less calories all right next one is yellow mustard guess how many calories are in this L zero and this one because it's zero Cals you can add add libidum which is Latin for as much as you want all right so now what we do is we go mixy mixy you'll notice mixy mix is a common step in our no prep our no prep fantasies all right mixy mixy also if you like pepper pepper ises kind of good in here and uh some people like celery but like again I don't care about prepping that much I want to do like as little as possible to make something good but if you like some texture celery and cucumbers uh salt and pepper that kind of stuff works I I usually just don't cuz I don't care enough uh pepper I do usually have at the table I don't usually prep with that I just kind of sprinkle it on top all right so now we've just got this delicious yellow looking mustard bowl and remember we only have 390 calories still so like this is a meal like this is like this is 84 g of protein less than 4 00 calories if you had three of these every day you'd probably be pretty full you'd also be lean as because it'd be less than 1,200 calories a day all right so we take this set spoon put it on set bread a bite set easy peasy and if you have a beard yet again check yourself before you leave the house all right you Psychopaths we're going from lunch to breakfast again because you can't go in order here we are all right so what we're going to do is uh we're going to take this egg whites that has all the Hershey milk stuff in it um well I forgot to buy two of these for this video so so there's only going to be one milk but we're going to pretend like this is uh clear even though this is going to look like dark chocolate eggs but you know what it might be delicious so we'll find out all right so we're going to take our egg whites which are nice and chocolatey all right and remember this whole puppy has 100 g of protein in it here's why this is cool is that if you don't drink the eggs you can just nuke them because you don't need a pan to cook them so a lot of people don't know this but uh you can just microwave these guys and they just fluff right up so usually they actually have the directions on the thing and if they don't they have it on the Google cool so let's go microwave these puppies over here I just Googled it and it said 90 seconds so we'll find out by the way look at this fancy cookbook that we made for you guys for free thank the team uh they put that together for you guys so hopefully you guys can just get more jacked CU who doesn't want a more Jack mation I mean I do all right so 90 seconds while the microwave is cooking let me show you a little special edition F I gave you guys the Fruity Pebbles and Crystal Light fruit version there's also a Cinnamon Toast Crunch version that I have I think done pretty good with all right so same original base of f but here's the difference is that in the F instead of squirting in Crystal Light you're going to add in vanilla extract mixy Mixie add in one or two packets of your fake sugar of choice or real sugar if you feel like adding calories I don't care either way all right and then on top of that instead of adding Fruity Pebbles you go CTC like a king on top sprinkle it and enjoy and if you want to get fancy fancy and you're serving it for your lady take some cinnamon do a little dusting on top little chef's kiss back to the microwave all right so look at this looks like a sule all right so we got our eggs all sued which is French for Blow by the way uh which is kind of funny all right so we got our egg whites here and uh obviously you know chocolate it's probably delicious in and of itself probably does take taste like a suai but uh if you're less fancy than me which maybe you are or maybe you're more fancy than I am I just use canned canned Salita all right and we just going to pop this puppy all right and what I do is I don't again I don't count calories on Hots because I just don't care like this whole thing is 150 calories for this whole Mamba Jamba and I'm not going to have anywhere close to you know anything reasonable on this so I'm just going to put some sauce on here and like that's it now imagine this is white instead of chocolate but it's actually really good it's really easy to do now here's the thing is I made like a cup maybe of eggs if this thing was this whole tall boy i' need a bowl like this like egg whites blow up in terms of size and so if you are somebody who's like on an extreme diet or somebody has like a huge appetite and you need to be full doing a tall boy of this and actually cooking the eggs is a mountain of food and so uh that's why I drink them rather than eat them cuz I don't even have the appetite to eat that much even even when I'm like dieting and starving I don't have the appetite to eat that um but if you are somebody who has that salsa plus egg whites plus microwave zero prep zero skill all protein all delicious all the time so now that we're done with the salsa and eggs let me tell you what I actually eat for breakfast every day the world's shortest and easiest 84 g of protein that's 230 calories of Pop 460 in total so 84 g of protein 460 calories all delicious honestly Fair life you guys did a gift to humanity by coming out with this this is only recent by the way until like not that long ago we just had to eat chalk dust mixed with uh and I was willing to do it hey willing to do it for the gains um but these are actually really good these just taste like chocolate milk I prefer vanilla obviously have chocolate I mean I'll drink them both um they're both very good but vanilla tastes like melted ice cream it's really good and uh this is how easy it is to prepare and make this I think this is a summer month this is probably bottled in July just a hint you can taste some of the floral undertones all right so last but not least and the reason I'm doing this one is because I actually up one of the other 12 dishes so I couldn't do it but this is actually what I have for breakfast mday anyways all right so that being said let's do kudagra right cud if we want to get fancy on it all right uh bro nachos so there are three ingredients in Bron nachos or Brin brot chips uh they are as follows number one Quest cool ranch chips side note this is the in my opinion the best flavor they have bu a long shot I mean the other ones are fine but but like these borderline taste like chips the other ones are like protein chips um these are really really good so number one got quest uh ranch chips number two horel chili delicious make sure that you get no beans cuz you want beef in there uh what's cool about this is uh there's lots of protein it lasts forever you can buy them in bulk I'll tell more about this stuff later number three is Le or Fage depending on how you feel like pronouncing it uh also more protein you've noticed it's a common theme and number four salsa all right so let's rock and roll let's go over the macros real quick so number one this is 140 G sorry this is 140 calories 19 gram of protein I mean this is leaner than most protein bars in terms of calorie content and I think they're delicious like this is this gets close to just what a chicken breast is so like really really pure source of protein and also delicious um this Hormel chili is uh is is 520 calories per can 30 30 30 g of protein so a little bit fattier but again we're making a meal here and I'm trying to make this bastic all right so there's that so that's 520 calories this guy we've already covered from earlier and then salsa usually has no calories and this is 5 calories per serving 50 calories for the whole thing so let's assume that I want to have a bastic voyage and we're going to go on it together so number one is uh we're going to try and eat a lot here all right so let's make 100 g of protein per the usug all right so we're going to go two two bags of chips because why not all right so that gets us 40 right off the bat now obviously guys you can cut it in half and if you're a little a little itty bitty little itty bitty girl itty bitty guy you can uh you can just have half all right that's fine all right so we got 40 g of protein so far all right now we're going to take our horel chili so what we're going to do here is we're going to this guy here there we go all right and then we're going to put a little chili on there little spoony spoon oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah there we go all right so now we got 70 GS of protein and we need 30 more and obviously if you want to like have more protein you could just have a leaner meat this is just fun and easy because I said earlier I wanted to have no Preps stuff so that's no prep all right and so we need 30 G more which is going to be 1 and 1/2 cups this is 2 cups this whole thing so it's basically going to be most of this all right there's one all right left about all right a quarter in there all right now you could probably just do this and be pretty happy about it but I like throw a little salsa on there and just like that take your Chips you take your take your sour cream take one of these guys go on top get really get in there there we go there we go yeah honestly a fox is great it's really delicious it's actually good and um this is food and so this is how we'll make it for camera real life I would take a bowl I'd start with the chili I put the sour cream on top and have the salsa I would take the chips and I would dip it in that way the chips stay crunchy doesn't look nearly as cool but that's what I would actually do all right and so that is the bastic voyage of nachos and protein it is 12 ways that you can have zero prep zero intelligence 100% protein as little fat little carbs as seemly possible while having maximum deliciousness in little time and if you make a mosy meal tag me on Instagram or Twitter I'm going to be rearing the best ones and if you guys find something that's even more delicious than the 12 that I had that is zero prep that's 100 grams of protein that takes almost no time tag me in that cuz I might try it myself but I'll definitely be sharing it so thank you guys keeping awesome hope you guys have an amazing 2024 get as shredded as you want and uh that one of these meals actually gets into your rotation and becomes a main day and for x-rated food content like this check out my only fans m\n"
