  "transcript": "the reason Costco has done food samples for such a long time is that it drove sales they knew that giving away free food and paying people to sit there giving away toothpicks of stuff sold more product they're not idiots let's say you try all the things at Costco sampling which many people do you tried 20 things but one of them you really liked you're like man this bean dip seven layer bean dip is not that bad what do you do you buy one what would you have not done if you hadn't done it you wouldn't have bought it all together if they had offered none of those so the cost of all those samples is the cost of delivering the lead magnet but they make it up and some in you buying the thing\n"
