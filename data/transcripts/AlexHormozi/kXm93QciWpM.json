  "transcript": "let me tell you how one of my favorite videographers got his job as a videographer here he was actually one of our editors and he really wanted the videographer role but he had no experience with it and we prefer to have people have experience so that we don't have to incur the cost of them learning on the job so what he did was he thought okay well how do I show that they're not going to suffer for me not knowing how to do it so he then videotaped his girlfriend the whole weekend and then cut it and edited it into a vlog and then presented it to the team and that level of proactivity like hey I took two days out of my time just to show you that I think I'm ready to give this a shot will you give me a shot at this no matter what organization you work in if you want a job the easiest thing to do is demonstrate that you can do it ahead of time and then show that you did it on your own time and the likely that you get it versus other candidates is 10 to one\n"
