  "transcript": "my favorite line in The Matrix is when Morpheus is standing on the hell and he's looking at towards everyone and he said I stand Here truthfully unafraid not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me and so the struggle period that you may be in right now is the path behind your future self that you are building so that that man or that woman can stand on the pulpit and look at you straight dead in the eyes in the mirror and say I'm confident and I stand truthfully here unafraid not because of what I said my goal is going to be but because what I've been through to get here\n"
