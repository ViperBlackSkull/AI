  "transcript": "the work works on you more than you work on it and so it's about who we become while doing the work more than the outcome from the work itself because like I lost everything 5 years into my entrepreneurial Journey but I still had all the skills and beliefs that I had from before that and then I was able to reapply those and then have what we have today and so I remember when I lost everything that first time I thought did I just lose 5 years of my life I'm at Ground Zero again but I wasn't cuz I had all these skills that I had learned owning and scaling six gyms\n"
