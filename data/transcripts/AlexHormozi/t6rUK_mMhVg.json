  "transcript": "you got to give to grow and so whenever you ask you slow down I'm all about growing as fast as I possibly can which means you got to give as much as you possibly can and then occasionally do an ask right which is that right hook my preference is give until they ask give in public sell in private just keep giving and people will start coming to you and if you're going to ask because you need to put food on the table which I understand then for me I would be way more than the 3:1 ratio and more like 10 times that which be like a 30 to1 ratio of giving to asking so I can keep maximizing my growth and keep my brand compounding\n"
