  "transcript": "we had someone on our team who we always really enjoyed filming with and we wanted to put that person in charge of the whole department and we're like okay well how do we get someone else to be just as good at filming with us and so we were like okay well we can't just tell people like be good at filming we're like what is it about that person that makes them so good to film with and what we realized when we broke it down one of the things is that like when we were talking they would not along like they were listening to what we were saying and so having someone behind who's like giving me feedback in real time created a short reinforcement or reward Loop that made it more enjoyable to film with and so for us identifying that little Loop made the whole thing more enjoyable and so in all aspects of business there are these little short reward Loops that we can identify and incentivize those things and now when we bring someone in they know that there's three four five six activities that somebody who behind a camera has to do that makes them excellent behind a camera and then we can onramp people and reward them for those activities because those activities reward the person who's doing the recording and then that becomes The Virtuous cycle of reward\n"
