  "transcript": "one of my favorite promotions to run to an audience is a gift card play the way the gift card play works is simple you say hey I've got these 200 gift cards and you want the gift card price to be about what one month of service is or one kind of core element of your service you sell those for 95 off and you say I'm going to limit to you to two per person all right so this is key you have a limit to the amount of gift cards somebody can buy and you do it for a very defined periods seven days three days 48 Hours you sell a ton of these and what they have to do is register the person who they're giving the gift card to and so what happens is you end up getting paid to get leads to sell your core thing to and so the people get Goodwill because the friend they're giving the card to doesn't know that they paid five dollars for a 200 gift card and so they get the gift they're happy about it you get the lead you're happy about it and you get paid to get to do this all together it's a wonderful play I highly recommend\n"
