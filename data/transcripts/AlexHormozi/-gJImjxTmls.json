  "transcript": "for all my friends who are over 30 and start peeing more at night I have solved this so I tried all sorts that was like put your water at the beginning of the day put your water at the end of the day like eat salt tabs at night so you increase your ADH levels like I've tried everything the thing that actually solved it for me and you're going to lose your mind when you hear it is that I stopped drinking so much water because the thing is is you got all these Health gurus who are like drink so much water drink so much water drink so much water and you know what ended up happening I pee all the time ancient man probably didn't have a gallon of water every day we probably did was he drank when he was thirsty and so I stopped planting any kind of water or liquid consumption I only drink until I'm not thirsty anymore and I don't drink extra and so simply removing that got rid of all of my nighttime peeing I think for me I'd rather be a little bit dehydrated than not get a good night's sleep and I'd pick that any night of the week\n"
