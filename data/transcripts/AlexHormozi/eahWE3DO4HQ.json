  "transcript": "if there's a top sales guy in your organization who's making more money than you compare not what his commission check is to yours every month compare how many calls he's making how many times you practices the script how many calls he's made before you how many sales he's closed before you what time of day he shows up at work what time of day he leaves if you're doing all the inputs the outputs will always match on a long enough time Horizon and if you are new to the game then my recommendation is not only to match inputs but to double or triple the inputs that someone ahead of you is doing you got to be like Kobe right where everyone else is doing one practice a day you do two practices a day and in the beginning they'll be better than you and then you'll match them but because you're doing twice the work eventually you'll get better and then that's how you win\n"
