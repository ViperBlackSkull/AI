  "transcript": "a lot of people watch YouTube for complex money-making skills and they haven't even mastered showing up on time it's like they want to go straight to calculus but they don't know how to do simple Edition woohoo I'm a college man I won't need my high school diploma anymore simple Edition is foundational to that and none of the other stuff will matter unless you can do the basics but the basics doesn't make them less important usually they're the foundation of building which make them arguably more important they just are simp to understand but not simpler to do and I think that's the big disconnect a lot of people have is that they think because they understand something conceptually that they feel like they have already mastered the skill which are two very different things\n"
