  "transcript": "you're not making as much money as you want to make because you're not getting as many leads as you need to have to sell stuff to and you're probably not getting as many leads as you need because you're not giving away enough free stuff because fundamentally if you give something away for free you will almost always have demand for it and if it's good you'll have exponential demand for because the value equation gets broken when you give away free stuff the value equation has four variables the dream outcome which is what somebody wants the perceived lik of achievement which is if I buy the thing How likely is it that I get the result that I want you have the time delay between when I buy and when I get so if I have to lose weight and it takes 12 months versus 12 days it's going to be way more valuable for me to buy something it takes 12 days and then there's effort and sacrifice which is how much work am I going to have to do and how much stuff am I going to have to stop doing that I like doing as a result of doing this purchase if I don't have to do anything it's guaranteed it's immediate you have an incredibly valuable thing if you make it for free then you get insane demand which then we translate into leads\n"
