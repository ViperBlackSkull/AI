  "transcript": "I'll see business owners obsess about like a $200 a month bill but hire three employees on for 80,000 year each without even blinking an eye it's interesting it's $250,000 a year bill that they're committed to no matter what no matter what happens but they don't think about it in terms of return on investment my advice is to think about everything in terms of allocation of resources where do I get the highest returns simply look at the payroll against how much business you expect that person to bring in and you compare them against The Benchmark of the team and over time that Benchmark should raise because everyone should be getting better\n"
