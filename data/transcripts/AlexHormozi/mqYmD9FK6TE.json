  "transcript": "when a small band starts playing they play local shows whatever if they hit it big they usually go a little more mainstream their music changes a little bit how they do their shows changes a little bit and so some of the OG fans are like they sold out but what they really did was just appeal to a wider audience the move they made was a trade between I could not appeal to this massive audience so I can continue to satisfy these people or I have to be willing to trade the positive associations with these people with the others growing a brand comes down to consistently pairing things with your brand that the widest segment of your potential audience has had a positive experience with you're trading a smaller amount of people who get pissed off by whatever the new thing is cuz anything that is different from what you've already done will change how people perceive you but with that you can start Shifting the brand over time into a new Direction\n"
