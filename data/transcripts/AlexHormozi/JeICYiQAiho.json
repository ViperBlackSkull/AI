  "transcript": "so she absolutely provides value to an audience she provides entertainment it provides inspiration for a lot of women I think she provides a lot of like self-acceptance because she just kind of like is unapologetically herself which I think is pretty clear from her content a lot of people who watch my stuff are in business or want to be in business and so they just think anything that's not business is not valuable but the vast majority of entertainers have significantly higher followings and it's because more people get value from their stuff people are willing to pay 1500 to go and sit in nosebleeds at a Taylor Swift concert and don't want to pay 500 to go to a real estate convention and a lot of people actually aren't trying to get into that game and so the only thing that they value is just in some ways escape from the game they're in you can't educate but for most people entertainment in and of itself is more valuable which is why Kylie can build a bigger audience than somebody who might just be an educator\n"
