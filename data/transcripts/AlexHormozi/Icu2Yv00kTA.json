  "transcript": "I think the best business for someone to start if they've never started a business before is something that they already have tangential experience with so if you look at like y combinator for example they look for Founders who have lived with the problem Andor have industry experience and so if you have both of those things like the likelihood that you will be successful with the Endeavor that you're going in is significantly higher there's a huge learning curve to entering any new industry and if you can just pay down some of that ignorance tax even if the opportunity vehicle isn't the perfect one you will still have a significantly higher likelihood of winning one of the big fallacies of your first business is that it's going to be your last business and almost never is and so the idea is like it's much more valuable to get started on something that you have a higher likely of success on so that you can get some faster rewards for the behavior of getting into business and then from there get some resources get some skills and then you can have a better perspective from which to make a jump or a decision on what to do next and at least that's my two cents on it\n"
