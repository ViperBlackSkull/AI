  "transcript": "not being in a rush is the single thing that I would tell my 19 year old self when you're 19 you absolutely are in a season of learning not a season of earning which means you should be willing to work for Far Below what you believe you are worth in order to learn to increase what that worth is and being willing to do anything to learn new skills so 100 of the money that you make eat ramen soup live in your parents basement it doesn't matter spend all of that aggressive amounts of money on learning specific skills around business or the thing that you want to learn\n"
