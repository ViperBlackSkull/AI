  "transcript": "there's nothing that scales faster than paid ads because if we're doing it right in the ideal scene you put a dollar in you get a dollar back and then some and then you can take that extra money and buy more customers with it so you bought one customer and had some profit so then you can buy two customers have some profit buy four customers have some profit so quickly getting customers is no longer the bottleneck or the constraint in the business and so the idea is to find the winning ad scaling the hell out of that one and then you don't need to worry about the row eyes or your marketing budget it's a get out of Gil free card that you can use for the rest of your life\n"
