  "transcript": "you didn't ask to be born the person who chooses to have a child is the parent not the child and so the person who's owed and the reason the laws are written that way is they have to take care of you it's their responsibility you are their responsibility but when you are an adult you are an adult you can make your own choices and the idea that you have some obligation and here's the kicker if they make you feel obligated to them because they say you owe them you don't need to accept that that's a choice\n"
