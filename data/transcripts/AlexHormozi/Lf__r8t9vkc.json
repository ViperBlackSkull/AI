  "transcript": "if I have no brand on a t-shirt the likely that someone buys it is low if I put a Nike Swoosh on it the likely that someone buys it is high if you go back to what brand originally was brand was like what you seared onto a cattle right it was a brand and so if you have two cows and one of them has a brand and the other one does it why do we do that they did that because it would change the person who was looking at its behavior and so if I look at a cow that doesn't have a brand I'm like I might have that cow that might be my cow I might take that cow for myself but if you see a brand that's got you know Tom's thing on he might return it be like oh this is Tom's cow I'm not going to mess with it cuz it's Tom's cow it has his brand on it and so the point of brand is to change Behavior at scale that brand over lots of time of branding has changed the behavior of zillions of people and so when you are branding you're just associating an idea that people don't know about and then we have to teach the masses so like branding is really just a teaching process of associating things they don't know with things they do know\n"
