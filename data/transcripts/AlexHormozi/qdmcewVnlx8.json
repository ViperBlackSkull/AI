  "transcript": "if it's worth doing it's worth doing well I shortcuted so much stuff when I was younger I just wanted to like get it done get it done get it done rather than doing it well there's kind of two ways you can take the setting which is why I like it so much many times I was doing things that were not worth doing and so I didn't have the time to do things well because I was doing so many things that were not worth doing because if it is worth doing then I have to understand that to do it comma right to do it well it's going to take this much time now given that is it still worth doing and if it passes that test of a being worth doing in the Long Haul and because it is worth doing worth doing well then it gives us this lens through which to see the activities we do so that we can prioritize the things that will make us the most money or get us closer to the goals we have\n"
