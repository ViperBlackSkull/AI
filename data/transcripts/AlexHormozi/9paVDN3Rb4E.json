  "transcript": "everyone's heard comparison is the thief of joy and I think that's total BS because comparison is a measuring stick it's just how you see the Delta between where you are and where you want to be and the thief of joy is the Judgment that we make on that comparison so if I say someone's 2 seconds faster me at the race it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with that I'm stating facts the problem is if I say that person's 2 seconds faster than me and therefore I suck the second part of the statement is where you get in trouble not the comparison itself and so judgment is the thief of joy\n"
