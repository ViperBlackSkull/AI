  "transcript": "the name of the game with Affiliates is activation my opinion poor people up Affiliates is they're like here's a bunch of good luck if you think of them as customers that it's way easier because then it's like what's my onboarding process you don't have to get them to pay to become an affiliate you have to do all the work for them I will say that each level of Leverage you add adds a whole another level of complexity because you have yet another customer to serve I would recommend just going one level up learning that one and then once you have that dialed then go another level up because each time you get more libraries and then you can prove out the success that you're going to bring that person's customers and then it makes the conversation either rather than like I'm figuring all this out at once and I'm going to figure out how to work with you and all your customers and all their customers like it's really tough appreciate it thanks\n"
