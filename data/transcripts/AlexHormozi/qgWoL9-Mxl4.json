  "transcript": "be patient is a very hard thing to operationalize so whenever you're doing anything you're fundamentally being patient for everything else that you're not doing as long as you have a plan of what you're going to do in the meantime you are patient for everything else that you quote want to be patient for no one's going to just sit there with their hands and be like I'm being patient no the marshmallow test for kids when they looked at what the kids were doing that were able to wait for the second marshmallow most of them distracted themselves they either took the marshmallow put it in their pocket they started like singing songs to themselves doing things in the meantime whereas the kids who couldn't resist it just sat there and stared at the marshmallow until eventually they broke and so what happened is instead of using willpower they just ignored it and kept themselves occupied that's the key skill is figuring out what you're going to do in the meantime not trying to think I'm impatient it's just you haven't figured out what your alternative plan is\n"
