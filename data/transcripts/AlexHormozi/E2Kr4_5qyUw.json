  "transcript": "I meet a lot of therapists and I'm like they got into this field cuz they wanted to fix themselves but like they're not super aware and then it makes it really difficult for them to like make assessments and then a lot of times they'll label people with problems and then those people stick with those problems rather than like hey you have a tendency to sometimes do this in these contexts cool well like what are we going to do rather than like let's talk about your parents and your trauma and like all these things that like none of these things are relevant like what are you going to change about your behavior let's just focus there but you know one do in the beer's perspective\n"
