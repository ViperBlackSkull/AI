  "transcript": "I think the best business for someone to start if they've never started a business before is something that they already have tangential experience with one of the big fallacies of your first business is that it's going to be your last business and it almost never is and so the idea is like it's much more valuable to get started on something that you have a higher likely of success on so that you can get some faster rewards for the behavior of getting into business and then from there get some resources get some skills and then you can have a better perspective from which to make a jump or a decision on what to do next\n"
