  "transcript": "back of my fraternities I eventually became president of the fraternity and every single season they would have new pledges and at week two like clockwork everyone would revolt and say this sucks this is too hard this isn't what I signed up for ETC I remember when it was my turn to be president I gave them a little bit of a different talk and so I said hey guys who here thought this was going to be easy and no one raised their hands okay so you all thought this was going to be hard right and they were like yeah this is what heart feels like soak this in right now because this is what it is and if you can get through this then you know that when other hard things come up in your life you can know the hard you've been through in your past and that's going to give you the strength to do whatever you want afterwards a lot of people are going through hard times right now and if you wanted to make a million dollars you wanted to make you know a hundred thousand dollars you want to make 100 million dollars did you think it was going to be easy probably not and whenever I get to that point I always think to myself this is where most people stop and this is why they don't win\n"
