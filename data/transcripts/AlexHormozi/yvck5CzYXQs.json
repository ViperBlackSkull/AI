  "transcript": "if I were a single guy and I weren't married to a woman who loves nice things I would probably have a blacked out Dodge Caravan totally murdered out and I would just roll up I could take eight people at a time i' have the sliding doors I go 0 to 60 in 8 seconds but I would be ready to partner wherever I could I could live out of that I like it cuz I like hey nobody Robs a guy in a minivan so it's safe it's also safe for for collisions and stuff which is nice too but I also like being underestimated when I show to places it's just more interesting\n"
