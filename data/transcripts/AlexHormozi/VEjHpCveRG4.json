  "transcript": "you're going to die two weeks after you die most people have forgotten about you six months after you die no one will talk about you if they're not caring enough then then it certainly doesn't matter what they think about your life now if that's the most significant event that's going to happen in your life which is that you stop living how much credibility or weight should we give to other people's opinions on what we should do with our lives in my opinion very little most the times it's just worth ignoring because they're trying to live their own life and they're projecting their own beliefs and experiences on you and you've spent all this time trying to improve your own view of reality through the beliefs that you've shed and shifted that they have not and so what they believe to be true is what they're casting on to you and if you don't like the life they have and I don't think it's worth listening to\n"
