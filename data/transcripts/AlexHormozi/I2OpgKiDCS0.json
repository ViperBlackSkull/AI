  "transcript": "if you think about Jay-Z in the beginning of his career the first thing he did was he learned how to rap all right that was you know maybe he had Rhythm that was a skill and then he turned he figured out how to do the lyrics okay and then he figured out how to put those together started to make a little bit more and then he started learning how to promote so he started promoting himself another skill significantly more money and then after that figured out how to do a record label and distribute even more money and then after that he figured out how to recruit other artists and get them sound on his label even more money and so what happens is that he still needs these early skill sets even though he didn't monetize them hard there he monetized them big later and so skills will compound\n"
