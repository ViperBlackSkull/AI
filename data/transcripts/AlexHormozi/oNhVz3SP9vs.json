  "transcript": "let's say you've got a a Shopify store that sells coffee mugs and you spend $11,000 a month and you make $3,000 back so the constraint of the system at some point will either be I run out of mugs it could be that I just need to spend more money because that might be the constraint today and then I spend enough that I run out of mugs or I spend enough that my cost per impression exceeds my profit because I go to colder and colder audiences so then the constraint there might be like I need to build a brand or I need to get trusted sources to increase the awareness let more people know about my stuff so that when they do see my ad they're more likely to make the purchase it's really being able to accurately identify what the contraint is\n"
