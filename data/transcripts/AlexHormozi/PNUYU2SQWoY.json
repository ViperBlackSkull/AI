  "transcript": "the first hire should free you up to do more Revenue generating activities it's less about how much they're going to make you but more about how much time they can take off your plate so that you can fill your plate up so let's say you can do five thousand dollars a month on your own but eighty percent of your time is spent doing administrative tasks okay well if you get somebody to take the 80 off then the 20 that's Revenue generating can then become a hundred percent and then you can 5x your income to go to twenty five thousand dollars a month and you can be able to cover the cost of the other person so the concept in entrepreneurship of hiring is always just trading up your time in terms of value per unit of second that you can generate as an entrepreneur\n"
