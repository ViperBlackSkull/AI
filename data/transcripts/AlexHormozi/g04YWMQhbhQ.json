  "transcript": "not quitting if you want to do something else is like not taking a stranger up on a free lottery ticket if they give you a free lottery ticket and you lose you're back to not having anything if you win then your life changes forever quitting your job is short-term pain for long-term fulfillment because the short-term pain comes from the Judgment of others and likely a back step in income it's really a long-term short-term sacrifice which a lot of people aren't able to make\n"
