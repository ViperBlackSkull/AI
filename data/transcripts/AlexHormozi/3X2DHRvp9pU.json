  "transcript": "the ice coffee hour interview is probably my favorite interview the first one that's probably the favorite interview I did I think is there some internal external stuff so externally it was the first time that I talked about like kind of like My Views around the world and I think that with a certain percentage of people that resonated with them because a lot of people don't articulate what they believe for fear of getting attacked I mean myself included which is why I hadn't done it and so I think that was like the external thing that happened but I think internally because of the positive reception overall that I got from that particular podcast it made me feel a little bit more comfortable kind of sharing more of probably like the contrarian views that I think have contributed to a lot of the material success that we've been able to achieve and think a lot of that stuff is like you cannot have common beliefs if you want to have an uncommon life\n"
