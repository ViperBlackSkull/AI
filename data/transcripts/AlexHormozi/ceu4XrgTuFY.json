  "transcript": "when you're building skill sets if you think about like a bridge right you have this bridge that's built of bricks what happens is you need every single one of the bricks for the dollar to start coming across and you might have 20 of 28 bricks and then you spend all your time reinforcing bricks but there's still a gap and so you keep buying courses and watching YouTube videos about copyrighting or building landing pages but the thing that you don't know how to do is run ads or the thing that you don't know how to do is sell so if you can identify the gaps which is hard to do because you don't have the perspective from which to make a judgment because you've never been there then having someone from the outside who can point to the few cracks you have can so quickly drag your future into your present you can move that much faster\n"
