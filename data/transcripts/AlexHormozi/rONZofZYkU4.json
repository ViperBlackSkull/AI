  "transcript": "ninety percent of wealth is blown by the third generation of a legacy education is what needs to be passed down not the assets themselves for example my families are on it we were well off in Iran and when the new regime came into place They confiscated all of my family's belongings my father came here the United States with a thousand dollars in a briefcase and he built his life here because of his education he was a doctor and within two generations the wealth passed down is now the same as it was there with me but it was the skills not the assets that were transferred from father to son if you transfer the education you can make sure that whatever Legacy you want to have is passed on if you just transfer assets without the ability to wield them they will eventually be gone in two generations\n"
