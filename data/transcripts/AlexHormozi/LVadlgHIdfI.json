  "transcript": "you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink well if you bleed it out enough and you starve it and you leave it in the sun and you put the water right in front of its mouth I can veritably guarantee that I can make it drink if you can control every one of the variables externally to an organism you can control Its Behavior we can also starve out the negative things in your life like you can starve the alcohol you can starve the friends and I think the easiest way to do that is to get out of the environment you're in\n"
