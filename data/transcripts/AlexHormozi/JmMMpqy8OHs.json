  "transcript": "so if you ever have one of those bosses that tells you what to do six things today and tomorrow he's like here's six more ideas and the next day you're like here's six more ideas instead of just saying like yes sir ask a follow-up question and just say where do you want me to put that on our list of priorities it'll cause them to pause and say wait what else do you have on your list and then be like well here's the six things you told me yesterday and the four things from the day before they're like oh yeah don't worry about those this is the new priority you'll be able to see how they think through priorities so you'll be more aligned with the long-term vision of the company but then they'll also see that you're thinking strategically because you're actually doing what most people don't which is trying to prioritize activities and if the person switches priorities all the time that's the boss for now and maybe long term you want to find a different boss but at least you'll be doing the thing that matters most at that moment and they'll know you are\n"
