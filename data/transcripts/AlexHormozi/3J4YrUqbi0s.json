  "transcript": "the hardest respect to earned is one zone and this was something that was really hard for me is that I had a pretty bad reputation in the very beginning of my college career in all of my high school career and it was because I drank too much I was irresponsible I slept around a lot and I wasn't representing the tempers that I wanted to be and so I felt ashamed of the behaviors that I did but I didn't change them and so it was only through a conversation I had with my father where I said how do I change my reputation how do I get these people to stop saying this stuff and I thought there was some like PR marketing angle that I could take that I could control the narrative and he said why don't you stop being a piece of but I was like that can't be it I'll figure out a way when parents talk to kids they're listening but they're not listening that really stuck with me and I started thinking about it and so I said like well if I wanted to be somebody who was respectable what would I do and so then I tried to start acting in that way to be someone who's respect my own I would earn and so when I started doing that nothing changed externally people still treated me like I was piece of and they were probably right but my behavior began to change and then slowly so did my reputation but it started with me trying to respect myself first and then others began to respect me as a result\n"
