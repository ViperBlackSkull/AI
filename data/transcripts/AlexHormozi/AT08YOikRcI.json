  "transcript": "the biggest advantage that a salesman has is that the person has already said they have a problem you said you needed help I'm here how can I help you a lot of sales is clear communication it's being clear about why we're here and then we get agreement that we understood the problem that they said they had next and then from that point we have to turn the desire into a decision whenever we rework a sales script with any of the portfolio companies a lot of times they have all this Gobbledy cook and so I like the shortest possible scripts because a lot of communication is wasted they say hello build rapport talk for 30 minutes see that there's time that's running out and then realize they have to pitch right and so then they motor mouth and then just awkwardly ask it's not normal human communication and you're not providing value to the other person\n"
