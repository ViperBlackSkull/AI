  "transcript": "in my bones believe that the only thing that makes the world better is entrepreneurial businesses and so the more business owners we can equip with the skills and lessons that were very difficult and painful for us to learn and so we do that by building worldclass companies and documenting it and then we share it and the key point of sharing is like we share it so that everybody can have it then the more good businesses will be out there and even if none of them ever work with us like we'll die and it won't matter and it's okay and we're happy to just help people out and we're good with that\n"
