  "transcript": "branding is teaching Behavior at scale if you think about the origins of the word branding was branding cattle so you had a cow and you had some sort of logo into it and so then we have to ask what was the objective of that action well the idea would be that if someone saw the cow next to a cow that had no brand they would behave differently and so for a cow that had no brand they might take it they might kill it they might leave it alone whatever they would do with an unbranded cow but with a branded cow they might return it to a specific owner or they might kill it because they hate the owner right it's still a brand and you might hate the person who's the owner but the key difference is that would change your behavior\n"
