  "transcript": "I was walking with ilila on the strip and some guy bumped into her or something and he was like watch yourself skinny like he said that to her and she was like you think I'm skinny like she said it like half jokingly to me afterwards we just obviously kept walking but I thought it was such an interesting thing is that he meant it as an insult she chose to take it as a compliment which then meant that like all of the like these things that we you know we toss at one another it's like it's only because we choose to accept that it's an insult that it becomes insulting like I'm sure someone at some point in your life has said something something that they intended to insult you with and you're like oh well that's not that's not that bad I'm actually kind of okay with that if I can make that thing okay one time then I can do that every time because it's literally just a choice on how I want to perceive it\n"
