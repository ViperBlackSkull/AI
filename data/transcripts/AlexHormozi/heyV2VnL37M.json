  "transcript": "there are three main things that people have to develop skills traits beliefs about the world in my view entrepreneurs are limited by one of those three at any given moment so if you have impeccable character and you have great beliefs about the world but you have no skills you will only be able to provide value to the level of your skill and once you add a ton of skills to your tool belt the sky's the limit the flip side you've got tons of skills but you don't have the character trait of focus you can't stick with something for a long time it doesn't matter how skilled you are you won't be able to accomplish it because you don't have the character trait to get there\n"
