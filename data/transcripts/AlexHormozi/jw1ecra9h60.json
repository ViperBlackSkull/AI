  "transcript": "there's five stages that you go through when you're considering a new opportunity phase one is called uninformed optimism this is where you are uninformed but you're like man this opportunity sounds so great look at all these people making all this money and then you get to something called informed pessimism you're like oh wow this isn't as easy as I thought and then you get into the valley of Despair sad face sad face this is where most people quit and this is what most people do now they find another one of these things to get into and they go all the way over back here to uninformed pessimism and so what happens is people keep repeating the cycle over and over and over again and they never make progress when you do find something that you're like you know what I kind of like this this is harder than I originally thought this is actually really hard I guess this is why everyone isn't rich and then something magic happens you then start to have informed optimism you now start to realize I haven't gotten there yet I understand the math and then you finally get to the Final Phase which is achievement and that's what you saw over here that you were optimistic about but you didn't understand the path that it took to get there\n"
