  "transcript": "way way back I would go out with my trainers and we'd all just get hammered and it would happen all the time and I definitely did things that I shouldn't have done and said things I shouldn't have said and like was telling them everything that was going on in the business that I was worried about and so like they just didn't respect me as an owner because I just didn't know how to draw that line all the guys were the exact same age as me right and so it's just being able to hold whatever the line is for respect now some people just can't do it and so which case then don't be friends with your employees as long as you can maintain respect then I don't see an issue with grabbing dinner or grabbing cocktails as long as someone's not you know irresponsible or it's like a regular thing that like everyone loses their minds it all just comes down to respect\n"
