  "transcript": "if you're starting a new business the best thing to do to get your first five customers is to give away the service for free and don't believe the people who tell you that you're a special Snowflake and you should value your time because let's be real it's not valuable because you're not good yet because they're your first five clients and so what you do get when you get first five clients is you get people to finally say yes number two is consider them free trial clients where you need to keep serving them at some point when you say hey I can only do this for money now they want to pay you to continue to get the stuff and if they don't then the only exchange you ask for is that they give you feedback they give you a review or a testimonial and if you do a really good job that they refer a friend\n"
