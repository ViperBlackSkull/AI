  "transcript": "let's say I had a brick-and water barber shop I would have the waiting room where people like sat before they would you know get seen with Florida ceiling testimonials and so if you're like well how am I going to get testimonials the easier way is to go to your reviews on Facebook Google Yelp and screenshot every single one of them and then go to the Dollar Store and put $1 frames around all of them and then just floor to ceiling like you can't see the floor and you can't see the ceiling of just festar reviews and so when someone walks in your establishment they look around they're like people must really like this place and so it automatically skews how they're going to perceive the experience and it costs nothing\n"
