  "transcript": "one of my favorite statements in all of business is if it's worth doing it's worth doing well most people take that as oh I should do a really good job at everything and that's not the right way to think about it it's actually that most things aren't worth doing if you look at someone who's more successful than you and you look at their schedule it's not that they have more hours in the day than you and it's not that they're doing more things than you it's that they're doing different things than you it's not about what they're doing that you aren't but about what they aren't doing that you are the leverage they get on the few activities they do are getting outsized Returns versus all the activity you're doing\n"
