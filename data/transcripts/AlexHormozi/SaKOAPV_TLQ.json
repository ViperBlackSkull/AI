  "transcript": "I was actually pretty nervous to talk in class when I would do like presentations the first time I ever talked on stage it was 1500 people so I went from like nervous to speak in front of a high school class the next time I spoke in public was in front of a thousand plus people and I wasn't nervous that time and it was because when I was talking to high school I was talking about stuff that I didn't know about you're making it up as you go you've crammed the night before you're talking about like Thomas Jefferson's cousin whatever it was something I didn't care about and I didn't know about so I was afraid of looking like a fool that's been probably a perspective that I've taken for most things I talk on is I just try and talk on things that I have done so no one can really poke holes in it\n"
