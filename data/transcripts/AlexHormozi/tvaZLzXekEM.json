  "transcript": "if you have the skill of sales it's in my opinion that when someone's the most excited the most in pain is at the first moment so the day you walk in the gym is the day that you are the most in pain and so trying to sell someone later when they've already had some results or the novelty has worn off to me always sell it backwards I want to get someone in make a very strong argument for why they should commit and then also get the bigger commitment upfront which actually long term makes it more likely that they're going to be successful especially if it's something where they have to do a lot of work which in the Fitness business there is a lot of work customers to do that's how I approached this\n"
