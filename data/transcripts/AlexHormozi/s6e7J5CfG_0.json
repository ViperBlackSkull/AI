  "transcript": "how are you just so incredibly male model looking I always knew that putting sunscreen on your face was a good thing I've actually tried for like a decade to get myself to do this so I fixed that by using a concept I call watering holes which is there's a seat I eat in there's a seat I chill in and there's my office so there's the only few places that I actually spend time in if you might have a massive house or a tiny house doesn't really matter you only tend to sit in a few places throughout the day and so what I do is I use those watering holes that's where I put stuff so that I get constant cues to remember to do that stuff so it's like if I'm having coffee and I always sit in the same seat and I want to do it in the morning then I put it next to my coffee maker or I put it in the seat that I sit in while drinking my coffee\n"
