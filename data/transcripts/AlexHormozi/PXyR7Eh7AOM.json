  "transcript": "so I have the silhouette of Donald Trump here and he has a very strong brand he has a big reach lots of people recognize him even just the silhouette alone he has strong influence as in the percentage of people that when they see this have a reaction in either direction positive or negative meaning many people move towards him very strongly and many people move away from him and so many assume that all brands are that way and that's just because there are many examples of that but that doesn't mean it has to be that way some Brands managed to change many people's behavior towards them all at once and so like Taylor Swift sure I'm sure she's got some crazies don't get me wrong but the vast majority of people who see Taylor Swift recognize her she changes their behavior and most of the time it's towards her so she is a large positive strong brand this is also personally why I think the idea of like seeking out controversy absolutely gets you recognized but you don't have to make that trade you can't absolutely just build a strong positive brand Mother Teresa has a strong positive brand a lot of people know her must be like I hate Mother Teresa some people do but most people don't\n"
