  "transcript": "my biggest learning of even the last year to two years of my career has been packaging if you look at McConaughey when you went from rom-com rom-com rom-com shirtless shirtless shirtless he basically like disappeared from the scene and then came back and like did Dallas Buyers Club and like all these other movies where he took like serious roles on Etc and I think that like for me it was like I was making all gym stuff I wanted to push myself away from all gym stuff and I kind of slumped to the background only thing I produced at that point was the podcast which I'd rebranded as the game but I still wasn't doing anything else that was public and that was like a year or two and then I started making content publicly so I feel like sometimes you have to like give a little bit of distance or like give a little space so they're like kind of like reset go out with like whatever the new kind of Direction you want to go\n"
