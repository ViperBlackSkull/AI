  "transcript": "if you make more money sooner you will attract more attractive women that being said they may be more attractive physically but then if they came to you because you have money then why do you think they're there and so it really just depends on what kind of relationship you want to have there's a reason that they have the stories of the popper and the prince the guy pretends like he doesn't have money to find a girl who actually likes him because it's great for Instagram to have the model next to you or whatever it is so that you can gain status from that but like when you're alone at night and the person that's in bed with you you like have no shared reality and everything that they believe about the world you hate is it worth it for me it's not\n"
