  "transcript": "so there was a research study where they had three bottles of wine they had a cheap wine they had a mid-price wine and they had an expensive one and they had people try them out and so people said oh I think the most expensive wine is the best the middle price is the middle and the cheapest wine was the worst and that's not that surprising except when the researchers explained that all three wines were the same and so in a very real way when you raise your prices you do actually make something that's more valuable because if that's what we're trying to get at which is value price confers value to your product a more expensive thing is perceived in real terms as more valuable even if the actual core product is the same why would you not want to make your thing more valuable\n"
