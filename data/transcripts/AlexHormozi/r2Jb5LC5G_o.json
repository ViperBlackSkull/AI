  "transcript": "I think there's just a big myth around passion I had a mentor way back when who said never do something you love he said because then becomes work I think that you only really love something if you're good at it and you only get good at stuff by doing a lot of it and if you start doing something that you haven't done before you'll probably suck and so you have to suck in order to be good and so how can you say that you have to be passionate about something it's basically saying I have to have the end result before I do the first step\n"
