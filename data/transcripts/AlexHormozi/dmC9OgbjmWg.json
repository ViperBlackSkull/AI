  "transcript": "so I got a head-on collision at 60 miles an hour and I walked away no injuries but it was like my wake-up call but not to stop drinking it was my wake-up call that I needed to have these conversations and that's what I was avoiding when I was drinking it wasn't the alcohols what were the things that I'm avoiding that I'm using alcohol to get away from and so the next day I had the first conversation with the first partner and it was horrible but the moment I was done I was like I gotta call the other guy and I called the other one I was like this is how it is and the thing is is I had this backstop of my death you almost just died because you wouldn't have this conversation and so then it just gave me this courage and whatever the reaction was I was like I'd rather be alive\n"
