  "transcript": "have you heard someone ask you why you want something why is actually an attack because it's the only question you have to defend if someone asks what where when those are all questions that you answer with a statement of just fact why is an attack that forces you to justify a response and so what they're asking is for you to come up with a reason that they say is valid but what happens is when you answer someone's question of why you were relying on them to validate your reason and so whenever someone asks me why I want something I just respond because I want to and that's reason enough\n"
