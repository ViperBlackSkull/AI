  "transcript": "one of the worst things that I see kind of dating marriage whatever industry is the labels that they ascribe to situations if you're not having a date night once a week if you're talking about business if you're they just insert something they then say it's bad let's say hypothetically Layla and I were so busy with work that we did nothing but work didn't have a meal together for a month if we both didn't have a problem with it because it was the season that we were in other people might say that's bad what they really mean is I don't prefer that in which case I say cool live your life your own way but don't live mine and if we're both good with it then there are no problems and so that's where I feel like a lot of people get off-roaded because they adopt someone else's preferences and ascribe good or bad meaning to their own circumstance and then say we need to change something or my girlfriend gets a date night every Thursday why don't we have a date night every Thursday because now the fact that we don't have one is bad and so for us as long as there's no discrepancy we're usually good\n"
