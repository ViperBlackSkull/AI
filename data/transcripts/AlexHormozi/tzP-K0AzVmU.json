  "transcript": "Chick-fil-A a normal meal for me would be like a thousand calories roughly so I would get a spicy chicken Deluxe no cheese and then I get a four count tenders fried and then I get the 12 or the 20 count nuggets grilled and then I eat them in reverse order of deliciousness because I figure I'm hungrier in the beginning so I go grilled nuggets with sauce and then I go fried tenders and then I finish with the deluxe it's a move\n"
