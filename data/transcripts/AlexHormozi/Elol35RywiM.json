  "transcript": "our yacht will eat this yacht yeah that's right it'll this yacht Lea is more yacht deprived than most people I basically talked about how motivation comes from deprivation the amount that you're motivated is proportional to the amount that you're deprived the more thirsty you are the more you want to get water so then you would think though that the poorer you are the more you'd want money but money is psychological not physiological so then it's about how you perceive the gap between where you are and where you want to be which is why rich people feel poorer than poor people do because they're more deprived of money that's why they go get more of it\n"
