  "transcript": "the worst practices that are used on a sales team actually come from not doing much at all most of it is just lazy sales managers like they don't want to listen to call reviews they don't want to give feedback they don't keep their one-on-one the feedback they have they don't keep track of what they did last week they don't note how someone's improving week to week and they don't have hard conversations until it's too late and they just surprise fire people and so all of those things create a culture of lack of trust and at the end of the day the sales manager sole responsibility is a culture of high performance\n"
