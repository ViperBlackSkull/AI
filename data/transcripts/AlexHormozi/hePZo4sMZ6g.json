  "transcript": "smartest people I've ever met in my life know exactly how and when to play stupid yeah it's interesting there's not a lot of advantage to having the other person think you're smart there's many advantages to having them think you're stupid there are some times where it is advantageous to be perceived as a bigger threat and it's actually when you're weaker it's always in the reverse situation so if you are strong you want to appear weak and when you are weak you want to appear strong so that you have fewer threats and so it's always trying to play the opposite position of where you're at which is why deception is a big part of War\n"
