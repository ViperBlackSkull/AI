  "transcript": "if you've ever heard I left my wallet at home here's the easiest way to avoid that happening in the future rather than asking someone for their credit card ask them for their ID first so what happens is they take out their wallet so you'll be able to see the actual cards you take their ID and then you say hey let me trade you for whatever card you want to use and you can flick it like this back towards them and at that point they'll trade you for the card for whatever reason they then say I don't have the card I want to use with me just say hey well if you have your phone with you open up your banking app real quick so then click see statements and on the top of the statement we'll have their account number and you can actually do a direct ACH to the account without even needing the credit card problem solved\n"
