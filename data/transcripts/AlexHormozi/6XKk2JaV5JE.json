  "transcript": "all the people who've described My Success back to me said like dude you're blowing up one of my earliest friends said uh dude you you went Super Saiyan but that's how they described kind of like what what started happening but I mean for me it was a very long path you just don't know which Link in the chain might create the outsize return it's just that you see every other link or every other brick on the foundation before it happens and so it just never feels that way until it happens and most of the time the overnight success only looks like an overnight success in retrospect\n"
