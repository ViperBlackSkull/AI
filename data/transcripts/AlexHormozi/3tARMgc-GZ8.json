  "transcript": "so when I started my gym I couldn't afford employees and so the way that I actually was able to afford payroll here's the trick I did everything I clean the floors I fixed the equipment I ran the billing I made the sales I ran the ads I recorded the ads I taught all the sessions and so I genuinely worked about 18 hours a day and I did that 6 days a week it was very very exhausting it was one of the few times in my life where I was actually chronically underslept to like nearly a medical degree I could sleep standing up like people use that saying but I actually had fallen asleep many times with my head against the wall standing I was kind of tired that a good night's sleep couldn't fix I think that most people radically underestimate the amount of effort that it takes to win in the beginning because they hear all the stuff about work life balance they hear all the stuff about you know you don't want to sacrifice your family life you don't want to sacrifice your health the thing is is at the end of the day you're going to make a trade for what's comfortable now for the thing that you want most and for me I would rather get through that phase as fast as be possible when you do that phase you have to do today's job and tomorrow's job and the next day's job to get ahead\n"
