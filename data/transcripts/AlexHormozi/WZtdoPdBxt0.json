  "transcript": "you never regret taking a night to sleep on an emotional response but you do regret the ones done in the moment when I think back to for Leila I would often have bad news or something bad that would happen and I almost like got off on being angry cuz like being enraged feels good it feels like you're just like an absolute but then like afterwards you have like an anger hangover what she got me to do was basically slow down she's like hey I get you're upset if you're still upset tomorrow chew their head off nine times out of 10 I'd wake up the next day and be like it's fine they didn't mean it it wasn't malicious intent it was just dumb and whatever and then we ask the question how can we decrease the likely this happens again in the future and then we can be productive about it rather than just insulting or assassinating someone's character\n"
