  "transcript": "here's why you want an affiliate Army if every month you get Affiliates instead of customers then every month that affiliate brings another $100,000 to my business which means month one I do 100,000 month two I do 200,000 300 400 500,000 and so on and so forth versus me just trying to sell 10 people every month that are worth $10,000 I would Plateau at 100,000 I would never grow even if I don't increase my Outreach or increase my advertising the Affiliates is going to pop off new customers to me every month so every month I add more that pop off customers to Me So eventually I have this Army of Affiliates that are pushing traffic my way and you never sold a customer directly\n"
