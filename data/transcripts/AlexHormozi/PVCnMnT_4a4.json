  "transcript": "I think the dynamic of the relationships and marriages that I have seen work best is where the wife is the husband's number one fan and to the same degree I think the guys should be the number one fan of the wife if you think about like what a fan is like a fan is somebody who shows up first at all the concerts who's the one who buys the T-shirt who's the one who listens to their podcast who even likes the stuff when they weren't as good but then has the number one fan feedback because they're rooting for them in the long term that they want them to get better but also to applaud them for the short term success of doing that they have if both people act like they are each other's number one fan they're going to be each other's number one fan for life until somebody else is the number one fan and then that person gets replaced I think if you want to make sure that you are always in that person's life forever you just become the number one fan and never let anyone else be a bigger fan than you\n"
