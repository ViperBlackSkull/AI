  "transcript": "why people don't make more money they're just not as good as they think they are I could spend two years perfecting a book and then after that two years release it and then for the rest of time have people who buy the book tell other people about the book customers Market everything for me the flip side is that I spend two months writing a book that's decent and then I have to spend the rest of my life promoting it it just makes less sense the thing is it just takes so much more time to front load that effort to make an exceptional product or service that most people aren't willing to do it\n"
