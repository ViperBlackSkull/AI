  "transcript": "I think that you can have friends who aren't necessarily pursuing greatness as long as they're helping you pursue yours that's the bridge in my opinion I like to be inspired by the people that I'm around I want to admire something in every friend that I have I have a very close friend of mine who is an FBI agent every time I talk to him he's got like new stories of things that he's doing and for me the benefit I get from the relationship is that it gives me an escape from the day-to-day business stuff that I'm dealing with he benefits in no way from the status from the followers because he has no way to financially benefit he's an FBI agent but what we both mutually appreciate about one another is that we've both been committed to being excellent at our craft I just want people who are as passionate about their art as I am who root for me to make the best painting possible\n"
