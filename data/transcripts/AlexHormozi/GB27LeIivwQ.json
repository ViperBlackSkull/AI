  "transcript": "the biggest company we have does 2 million a week right lots of money we still just do the fundamentals there is nothing fancy we try and contact leads quickly we try and personalize things to their problems we try and make sure that the sales reps leaves notes in the CRM so that when the customer success team gets on they have things to talk about we try to make sure that they consume the product and that they get onboard it appropriately and we set proper expectations about what they're going to get none of this is rocket science it's just doing it with 200 people with fresh people coming in every day that becomes hard but the process is literally always the same and so when you are a solopreneur everything that you do to make a billion- dooll company is the same thing as though you worked every rung of the ladder it's just being able to get other people to do the same thing that's where the complexity comes in you don't need to make a business complex it will become complex by simply trying to do the fundamentals at scale\n"
