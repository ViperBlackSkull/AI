  "transcript": "you have finite and infinite games right finite games where you have known players agreed upon rules and an outcome that wins the game right infinite game you have known and unknown players no rules and the point of the game is to keep the game going and what happens is that people apply finite rules to infinite games and then they wonder why it's not working what's an example so a finite game would be like baseball know the players at the end of the game you tally up the ones where the most runs and you win you can't hold the ball and run it around the bases like there's rules of play with an infinite game the Vietnam War isn't a simple example that's and NS which is basically the US lost the Vietnam War because they were applying a finite structure which is we're going to win this war and the Vietnamese people were playing an infinite game structure which is we're going to stay alive and keep fighting and as long as someone is staying alive and keeping fighting they will beat the person who's trying to end something and so the infinite frame always conquers the finite and the thing is is that most of the games worth playing are infinite\n"
