  "transcript": "there's this big misnomer between like double down on your strength you don't want to have weaknesses or the weakest link is the limit the thing is is that if you're looking at a business the business has to have all of the pieces to move forward but an individual can be unbalanced in their strength so if you have a salesperson and you have an IT person they have wildly different strengths but the business requires both of them them and other people and so the individual can double down on their strengths but the macro business still needs to be balanced and so if you're a business owner you have to look at the whole thing and say can I assemble all the people who can run this thing\n"
