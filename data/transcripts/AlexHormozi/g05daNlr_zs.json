  "transcript": "the internet and technology created an idea of infinity and the reason why life is beautiful is because it is fundamentally limited this may be like the last interaction we have and there's something beautiful in that whereas if you can play The Legend of zeld and just hit restart it doesn't have that feeling I think things that are limited in nature are more valuable than things that are unlimited scarce resources are is the most valuable and so if time is a scarce resource or life is a scarce resource it would be inherently more valuable we've seen all the vampire movies how they Envy the ephemerality of life for humans same thing with the Greek gods used to say they envied humans because things were more beautiful because they were temporary I think there's some truth to that if they're just talking about life in general\n"
