  "transcript": "to be clear I don't think there's anything wrong with monetizing an audience it really comes down to keeping promises for example I will probably be launching some product at some point in the in the future I don't think that I will have any negative response to it and so it really just comes down to like what have you promised or what expectations have you sat and then are you meeting those expectations my view on this has shifted a little bit over time is I used to think like you have to exceed expectations but now I think that it's really just like can you perfectly meet the expectations the person has now somebody might have really high expectations but you try and set them and meet them and you do that cycle as many times you can so that their predictive measure of trust with you is that you are trustworthy because you keep your promises\n"
