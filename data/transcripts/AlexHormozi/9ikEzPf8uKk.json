  "transcript": "the way that I think about brand from a visual perspective is like imagine a bouquet of flowers so you have all these different flowers inside of it so when you put all of them together the bouquet has an identity right now if you take out one flower and put it in a different flower it does shift it a little bit now if I break one of the flowers or make it rotten it really shifts it which is why if you get a DUI or girl as a really good guy all of a sudden it completely shifts the bouquet despite all the other flowers that you've done and associated with those flowers are bad now right exactly you can't hand your girlfriend just one flower that's rotten they she be like why did you give me a rotten bouquet even though the rest of ours are totally fine\n"
