  "transcript": "this is where most people stop and this is why they don't win that's a quote that has helped me get through some of those like really tough times do I want to win more than I want to fail yes this is a Trevor quote my editor and my closest friend he said well whenever someone says they can't stand it anymore well if you're alive you have proof that you can stand it and if you die you won't have to stand it anymore so you can always stand it and I think that's a really powerful message that's like the gift that we all have we all have stood life to this point and I think that's like all the proof you need that you can keep standing\n"
