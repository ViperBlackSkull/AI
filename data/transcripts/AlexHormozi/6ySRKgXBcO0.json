  "transcript": "mosination this is a day in the life for Layla and I we flew out to do two Keynotes in Orlando Florida I think you'll dig the presentation on branding I've never talked about a pumpkin the first time we took a private jet was out of necessity we were in Puerto Rico and it was right as hurricane Maria was hitting we see the news about it and I check flights and the flights are all like multiple connections so we drink a cup of coffee and then like more news is like this looks like it might be really serious and I checked the flights again all gone all right well we're going to be here you know it's fine and then we go to the grocery store to like pick up some water or whatever and two people are getting a fist fight over water in the island people are [Â __Â ] sprinting around the store she's like we have to get off this island I was like dude you don't want to be here when they're dead get back to our house and this old guy has this massive yacht he's our neighbor I was like oh what are you gonna do with that he's like oh it'll just get destroyed and I was like what oh he's like you should be fine I said just go to the third story first two floors of quad and Layla at this point is just like we're getting off this [Â __Â ] mileage she was like Charter a plate and I was like Mindy this is like the beginning of our wealth and I was like I Googled I call a plane I put it on speakerphone you need to get off where do we go he was like it'll be 70 grand and like we both looked each other and I was like so we're excited she was like yeah we're decided we both had come to completely separate conclusions from that number I was like so we're staying and she's like so we're going right and then she looks she's like what is my life worth to you I was like are you [Â __Â ] kidding me 35 Grand to save my life okay well it wasn't 35 it was 70. so I call like three other Charters and I'm like I got a guy who says he could do it for 50. and he was like I'll do it for 40. I called Other Guys by the way this is the last day you can get off the island and so like literally like he's like I gotta call some more to get a price I was like oh my God can we have four hours I got a guy who's like I'll do it for 28 and I was like cool he's like but you have to leave in two hours went straight to the airport and they were like oh actually it's coming faster we thought like these will be the last planes out we got on the plane and it was the first time in my life where money actually did something like useless [Music] okay [Music] for a Guana spotting I was getting in my car at the gym the other day I get in the car and I have the window down and this guy's like hey and I was like so like I actually announced my presence like whenever I walked through him I'm like I'm here if she doesn't hear me she just freaks up when you sat in the chair in the [Â __Â ] dark like a psycho and then you got mad at me when I cried he scared me so bad I started crying I woke up and he wasn't in bed right then I go to the bathroom I come back out I just assume he's left I just hear Hey scream and like cuddle and then I just start crying and then he's like what the [Â __Â ] I was trying not to wake you like I'm awake [Music] I made podcasts for four years going on everybody I am coming to you with one uh that I am excited about and like real talk they were just as good as the ones I have now years not like oh I did it for 90 days four years two to three podcasts a week every week and then on the fifth year it hit the real real it was just packaged as gym specific I'd say like my biggest learning of even the last year to two years of my career has been packaging everything I was taught early in my career is Niche down and so I did that and I maximized a niche but like at some point you maximize a niche and you have to go further I always am like slow to make those big moves because I want to make sure I'm not doing it out of being add that was a super tough call September 19 September 20 rebranded it as the game I just remember there was one day I was like I don't feel like talking about gym stuff anymore I can talk about business but like a lot of it for me has always been I'm so afraid to talk about something that that like I want to make sure I'm Legit if I'm gonna talk about it when I had the gyms hey guys I'm Alex and I'm the owner of United Fitness I had six I did six and then I did 30 plus turnarounds before I ever made a single piece of content like how you could run a gym better so I was like okay well I've been to 30 plus markets I had six on my own I was like I feel confident in saying like these things work better than these ones I wanted to over credentialize myself for whatever content I was going to make so that I felt like I could take whatever heat someone was gonna throw at me because I'd be like well here's why I think that like here's my evidence and I think that approach has been good it just takes longer I think the jerseys are dope can I try that on I could Rock a little a little double double if you look at McConaughey when he went from rom-com rom-com rom-com he basically like disappeared from the scene and then came back and like did Dallas Buyers Club Wolf of Wall Street and these other movies where he took like serious roles on Etc I was making all gym stuff I wanted to push myself away from all gym stuff kale became more public-facing I kind of slumped to the background only thing I produced at that point was the podcast which I'd rebranded as the game but I still wasn't doing anything else that was public and I was like a year or two and then I started making content publicly so I feel like sometimes you have to like give a little bit of distance kind of like reset and then you go out with like whatever the new kind of Direction you want to go is to me exactly what I did at the Q a for the VIP day I'm gonna get up there I'm going to write all of the topics I want to talk about and I'm just going to like hit them in whatever order feels good I feel good about it or it'll blow I envisioned a day where we have like the shareholder meetings where all the companies come out and we had that big Convention of all the portfolio companies that'd be cool the whole theme of the presentation is actually on strategy which is like I'll be like what the [Â __Â ] would that mean and then I'll break it down but like it just means do anything get the Mustang for the buck dude you guys are killing The Vibes I heard the Vibes like yeah I'm gonna briefly hit on brand it's like if you build a personal brand then you'll make more money from that than your gym but then if it's like what are we solving for you know what I mean it's the principle it's not about yeah [Music] rather than do slides which is normally what I do I actually want to draw the stuff live with you and I think it's more engaging that way if you've ever seen like a math problem on a board and it's just like all done versus like someone walking through the math it's different that's at least the theory and if it sucks you can tell me at the end brand isn't actually a thing it's an association we make between things that we know and things that people don't know which is usually our company if you think about a brand like a bouquet of flowers a bouquet of flowers isn't actually a thing it's many things put together and then we put it in our heads as an idea as one but it doesn't it's not actually anything because if you spill it on the floor it's not a bouquet anymore think of a brand as a bouquet of flowers but it's your bouquet of flowers and what you're putting inside of that bouquet are the individual intangible ideas that you want to associate together with the thing that people don't know about which is usually your company and so if I were to say some things about my brand you'd probably know that I have the best calves ever right so that would be something that's like associated with my brand dessert that's something that's associated with my brand now those are like fun little doodads but hopefully some of the things that you really associate with my brand are giving first providing value being patient doing the boring work and the reason brand and reputation is so hard to maintain is because so many people want to rub their [Â __Â ] on yours so let's say here's my bouquet then I've got this sad flower so this is a sad face flower if I handed my wife this bouquet all of the Roses are perfect and there's this one that's just wilted and dead the bouquet the brand the perception of it massively shifts even with one [Â __Â ] up flower and so that's why creating a brand is much more about cultivating deliberately the associations you want to make with the thing you have that people don't know with the things that your ideal audience likes that you want them to like too thank you [Music] oh thanks huh oh yeah good different it was great because you were just yourself cool this used to be the first song in my uh playlist for working out get my calves going I can choreograph way more like Symphony of feelings and visuals and charts and graphs when I do the presentation I mean from a prep time though way less my presentations are typically five slides per minute because I actually think about it as like a movie I'm gonna do a voiceover on a film there's this amazing video I think it's called Death by PowerPoint it was basically just like one idea one image that's it next idea next image that's it can you do that you're like that's only like 30 40 seconds and you're like that's why it's so many slides yeah I mean you saw 840 slides for the training thing we're gonna do that's how you build great training I always enjoy meet and greets with mosination because I get to hear like the real problems that you guys are going through but I get to go a little bit deeper than I normally can on like comments or like a short piece which makes it one of my favorite ways to interact just in general what would be your number one advice on how to get the attractive talent because some people say you want to make yourself some people say you want to try to post from other places I think you do both I think it's an and you want to have all the training you can because that gets you cheaper talent that you then level up but it costs time the more money you get the more you buy Talent rather than building it and so there's times you spend all this time training somebody then you realize that they're a [Â __Â ] dumbass if you were to internalize it it's like I'm not good at picking the right people I'm not good at training them like because those are controllables rather than the other person if you internalize it so for a gym for example writing ads on indeed and Engineering like that or hiring like within your clients I think both there's all those ways you can reach outs you can do content you can run ads like just like you get customers you get employees same exactly are you talking about your store with your dad consulting job with the government and it seemingly fancy but yeah you just weren't happy yeah but we'll give you the courage to be okay and disappointing your dad I just didn't feel like being alive anymore for me that was my that was my thing it doesn't have to be that for you but for me it was like well I don't feel like being alive and so I like the actual phrase I kept repeating myself was like I have to die to him in order to live for me I needed a new life and if that many wasn't gonna accept that new life which you didn't in the beginning I just had to be cool with them and I think that's a lot of that's like the the journey for a lot of guys like becoming a man is like when you start valuing your own opinion of you more than your father your cousin or whatever's so it's like you basically elevate your own opinion itself than other people's and then you become more independent like that's how you become independent it was my hardest thing oh I think I got a job I did we got one pick one all right all right guys I gotta head oh you're good you're good you're good I gotta go all right [Music] I actually really like the Explorer mine's got like fighting bodybuilding it's fighting a bodybuilding comedy is harder to click on because the other two are so much more visual if there's just a dude with a mic I'm like I don't know if it's gonna be funny but I do know this guy's jacked it would be interesting if if images make a comeback because I will say this when I look at someone's their profile I actually go only for the images because I don't feel like watching videos it just feels more chill so my next book is coming out and I'm stoked so here's a sneak peek it'll be interesting because I think part of what I want to talk about maybe even at the just I don't know if I want to do it maybe it'll be like they're probably because it's gonna be like raw maybe post I'll be like how to get the most out of this book when I look at my audience 76 of people want to start a business so like you should read it from the beginning to the end because you won't have context on any of this if you have a business lead magnets referrals because everyone has customers the core four-way that you advertise and then the way to make that way better which is the core foreign steroids and then from there you know read the other ones hey sweetie hey boo boo hey supermodel 's doing her thing that's my wife I see that yeah I'm starting to connect with the whole thing she's the range in the operation right yes she is I'm the pretty face you guys there you go what I want to do today talk about how to get other people to do stuff like making money these are the principles like I said that we have used to build gym launch Prestige labs and now acquisition.com [Music] [Applause] your book helped me make like 300 Grand this year so really appreciate that again really it could be really good acquisition.com no it's great no that's super sweet thank you so much man all the carnival guys are like vegetables are actually bad for you do you want to be a bird so it's just you and me on stage last week we'll just do it like we always do we're coming can't hear them doing Q a in front of a drawing board that is my happiest place I was incredibly impatient and it's really tough because a year is five percent of your life when you're 19 and so it feels like a really long time and so the idea of waiting one year two year three years just like 15 of your life you're like holy [Â __Â ] there's a reason that the sayings like good things take time like Rome wasn't built in a day those settings exist because good [Â __Â ] does take time to build and when you have that massive list of should Do's it does take two years or three years to build something exceptional and that's the reason most people can't do it it's recognizing that when you're 19 you absolutely are in a season of learning not a season of earning which means you should be willing to work for Far Below what you believe you are worth in order to learn to increase what that worth is and I had this exact conversation with my neighbor who was 16 at the time and I just said I can guarantee that you will be a millionaire when you're 30 if you'll give me 10 years I was like well you sign that contract he said yeah I was like okay then you're gonna eat [Â __Â ] for 10. and 10 is a long time because he's three years in and he's like seven more not being in a rush is the single thing that I would tell my 19 year old self and being willing to do anything to learn new skills who to hire what to hire as far as offloading service you're always making a trade with your time to do stuff to get money back at least from a business perspective and so if you're paying someone with money to get your time back they need to have an alternative vehicle that's going to get a higher return than what you're paying them right that's the fundamentals of when you're trading your time for money the order that you trade or replace the time is if you look at your entire week of activities and Layla has a great activity around this which is doing a Time study make an Excel sheet you don't need fancy software to do this and you have all the hours of the day put into 15-minute increments and this may sound tedious it's also really effective and will make you more money than it costs you time because when you actually have to write what you're doing every 15 minutes you realize that you are not going to waste seven hours of your day not doing [Â __Â ] because you want to get credit for it in your own head you do your 15-minute increments you write down the [Â __Â ] and at the end of the week you're like okay of these things what is the single largest block of time that I can give away for the lowest amount of money Million store for excellence tonight what are your prayers to your life I'm gonna hit this one really quickly of course meaning of life um so real quick answer for me my purpose of life is to learn and I defined yesterday learning as same condition new behavior and so I think that the majority of my life will continue to show me similar conditions and if I can become and behave in the way that ideally want to do at the end of my life then I've become the person that I want to become and all of the stimuli between the damn born and the day I die exists to help shape that person thanks would you like to talk about the meaning of your life okay I don't know a lot of the people there were like just mosination and were not Demars not a single questions about chips I was I was surprised last day here at Jim con I've got one more talk and we're gonna go and ask some of the attendees for more questions about their businesses I had this class in music teaching everybody a project basically just like really heavily researched one song and that was the whole class it was like one person would research the song they'd play the song for three minutes or whatever it was and then 27 minutes would be them giving like a full report and now that I say it out loud I think he just figured out how to not teach anything brilliant like I've got the highest grade in the class did his thing on hurt as soon as you play that song I'm like yes like honestly I think that was one of the best things ever happened on Nine Inch Nails the fact that Johnny Cash covered someone else's song have you seen the music video that I'll play for you it's sick foreign so good dude he died seven months after this video These are some sandals Water Sandals I think or hiking sandals I wear these because I can wear these in the most environments because I can wear these to the gym which I actually really like I can walk in them I can wear these in water I can wear these on the beach they're closed toe so I can wear them most restaurants and I don't have to wear socks what else do you need you many times I go to the pool and come out and go to a restaurant after going to the gym and presenting all the same form dude this is a [Â __Â ] Darwin outfit literally yesterday we did the talk and then I went to the pool and then I walked and then went to a fancy restaurant drying like 20 minutes yep and these are stretchy they're elastic it's the best everyone else's shorts are inferior one you don't even know about that like yours not adaptable we get wet you're [Â __Â ] you go to a nice restaurant you're fine I go to the gym you're fine all right I'm up the third time I've been introduced [Music] thank you we're gonna do a cool Deep dive together on a topic that I hold near dear to my heart which is closing the difference between help and manipulation is intention either way you're going to change someone's Behavior or your intention is to change someone's Behavior if the prospect knew everything that you knew they should make the decision to buy if you're being really honest with yourself if the prospect knew everything that you knew and then they would choose not to buy then you are deceiving them which is no bueno but this presidential will be the best resolution on sales you've ever heard the worst presentation on sales you've ever heard or somewhere in between that is a promise Charlie Munger big hero of mine he said we have a high moral responsibility to be rational sometimes you've got logical buyers sometimes you've got emotional buyers there are different types of people who buy in different styles just like their different selling Styles different buying Styles people want to believe you they want to buy you just have to help their logical brains justify the decision like most people are like hey I can make you a lot more money they want to believe you you just have to help them justify hey I can help you get into your high school jeans I can make you look the way you did 20 years ago they want to believe you make the decisions help yourself Implement like crazy take over ownership realize that there are no silver bullets but some things can move you closer to your goals and when those rare acceleration opportunities come in life take them because either win or you learn and both of those get you closer to wherever it is you want to go thank you overall it's an awesome trip above Jim Khan it's great to see the gym owners and our community there Jim Lords comment below if you want to see more Vlog stuff like this bye\n"
