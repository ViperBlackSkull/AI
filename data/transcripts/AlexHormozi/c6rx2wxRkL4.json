  "transcript": "when you put money into a bank you don't actually put money into a bank you lend the bank your money on the hopes when they give you a receipt it means that they owe you money back in the future now during that time you're trusting that the bank will have it in the future and have it immediately available for you and up for them they make their money on lending the money out to make more money on your money than you would make on your own the idea is if you can capture more upside by leaving the cash in the account then you can just make money with the money that's sitting there not as a primary strategy but it's just free profit\n"
