  "transcript": "there's a lot of things that can go wrong in launching something like this you have half a million people so you can look in a skyscraper look all the way around Baltimore and be like more than everyone I can see with my eyes has registered for this event I've been prepping for the presentation for two weeks all day every day I will not be the person who did not prepare and I will do that work out of respect for everyone else's attention offers was a meta example meaning the book and the course and everything it was was purposely intended to be an offer so good people would feel stupid saying no the book itself was an example of the concept of the book so 100 leads is different in that I want the example for the book not to be around the offer but around how we promote the book about how we got leads which is why this event was so important to use all the different advertising methods to promote the book like I could have just made a post to my audience about the book and sold plenty of copies and not needed to do warm Outreach or do Affiliates or do paid ads what's the point of this meeting what problem are we solving the most expensive cost in almost all companies is meetings that was supposed to be an hour-long meeting and we got off in 28 minutes so what problem are we solving the second is who's required to solve it if we know what the decision is then it's like I'm not needed so yeah it'll be on Shopify reason we did on Shopify was because um there's a bunch of issues with Amazon done for launching but the main one was that they wouldn't accept the amount of books that we thought we would sell Amazon limits any new book usually to five thousand or ten thousand heart backs and we had a pretty strong suspicion that we were going to sell a lot more than that so for that reason we basically fronted all the money did all the prints because we're self-published so we're housing and we're shipping it where we're housing it I don't like anyone owning my stuff and so whenever you publish a boat you actually sell the rights to your content kind of like musicians where they sell their music to a label same concept for me to like give you guys like a free chapter so the fact that offers was 1.99 those are all things that a normal publisher wouldn't want me to do because that's where they would make their money I want every person there to watch this presentation and be like I need to [Â __Â ] work harder like if that's like the deepest takeaway from this whole thing then like I can die pretty happy I mean most people spend their entire lives not being able to like influence 500 000 people and so like it's not lost on me [Music] my birthday [Â __Â ] it yeah good morning thank you appreciate it yes Trevor is probably the closest thing to her brother to me honestly we co-wrote the books I I get a disproportionate amount of credit but Trevor has definitely been the one that has helped me beat up every single idea he's been in a really involved in my life for a long time now and um I hope we can grow old and crotch it together welcome everyone to my book launch event I'm so pumped to have you guys here I promise I have spent a very long time time to compress days and weeks and kind of like a stand-up routine a standard routine that 60 Minutes has taken nine months to perfect like each 30 second bit that strung together created an hour and so it's kind of the same way with this presentation is that like it's zillions of hours compressed into that and that's why hopefully the value per second will just be like incredibly High my first presentations it was just like a few words and then I would talk at the slide over time and then I started adding more like bullets and text to slide and then I watched this presentation actually changed my life it's a 15 minute Ted Talk it was called like Death by PowerPoint it actually like forever changed how I made presentations which is like one idea per slide but then I got from the marketing and sales world to pair the idea with a visual yeah I just wanted to work that's all I want for my birthday is that all the tech works that's it I just want the links to work I want the page to work I want the processing to work there's a huge amount of like Aussies and new zealanders who are staying up as like entrepreneur parties so cool yeah I know so I've got a bunch of guys who have like you know one thousand two thousand person communities that are helping each other up for the event thank you let's see what we got going on pre-set up for tomorrow check this out this is the 360. wow when I dropped the offer people will probably lose their minds I have stacked it for like 17 minutes I just want to show the reaction so the stack is a direct sales tactic that has been proven so many times across so many industries that it is effective the goal for this presentation was to be remembered and so if I wanted someone to have an emotional experience going through this then I have to subvert the audience in a way I think that the stack accomplished that basically making a movie yeah basically Zack Snyder all right well okay rock and roll please what are the things that can go wrong right now I really want me to go wrong is what we can't control okay yeah just like zoom in general [Music] it's the big day Yeah tomorrow's a big day today is my birthday honestly I'm just excited for you guys to tear into it it's not even the event I'm excited for the post that happened one day two day three days four days later after people have consumed you know read the book cover to cover and read it a second time and started going through the course and listened to the audiobook that's what I'm more excited about but tomorrow is the first step to that and uh I'll see you then how many children we have we have over 100 000 in the check-in and currently on the feed 66. cool I'm ready damn right Nigeria Bulgaria Philly Pakistan super cool they're coming in international baby yeah around the world just melts and melts it just puddles so the nose trip said V1 of zero for the last however many months our team has used one-of-one content as kind of our concept which is the only way we say things that only you can say and show things only you can show then as the team started to find out all the things that we're going to be releasing and giving away and doing what no one else would do the team said in the chat dude this isn't even one of one this is one of zero what are you doing that no one will do and I think that raises the bar a lot more I am scared by that bar but I like that bar as an ideal to strive towards we're at 10 minutes you ready gonna be a ride twists and turns on this roller coaster Layla's so worried she's like wait you changed something it's like oh yeah I'm excited to see the reactions because there's gonna be 15 minutes of suspense where they're like is he gonna sell something right now what the good news is I have done this before a lot of times a lot of times I know how much work I put into it when you're in front of the crowd the only person's confidence who matters is yours there are men of talent and Men of preparation I prefer to be the latter so little did I know that as soon as I stepped on stage uh like three massive Tech issues uh break behind the scenes based on the sheer volume of clicks that were going at the same time to the same page let's get some leads is everything running smooth I think a lot of people have any issues with a low price we had 562 000 link Clicks in a matter of like 60 seconds whenever you have something like that it's going to put stress on systems that is very hard to test for you can run simulators which we had and we still had more people than the infrastructure could handle I would send them to YouTube so here's it so 140 000 people or so were not able to get in the team pivoted on the Fly and provided the YouTube link and we had another 40 or 50 000 people who made it over on that side people can talk on their mice in the zoom room yeah the second thing was that there were some Zoom rooms that the master Zoom thing wasn't set up the right way so that they they could like unmute themselves rather than like webinar presenter format now we ended up quickly fixing that well expensively voting for people now the YouTube live stream ended up being three minutes delayed and those were very three important minutes during the uh the entire launch event and so we were able to save 40 000-ish people on YouTube but during that first five or so minutes there was a lot of hustle and bustle trying to figure out what we were going to do to house literally a city of people so you're gonna get lead magnet Mastery you're gonna get the first five client framework Playbook you're gonna have the referral Playbook and you're gonna get the affiliate Playbook and the zero to 100 million dollar scaling roadmap from someone who's actually been there total value 1276. I could see the comments the whole time and I say this with absolute confidence I will bet that you cannot see that I can see the comments in how I was presenting how much is double your lead flow worth an extra 10 000 a year an extra 50 000 hundred thousand year you knew that everyone would turn on me for a brief moment all I could think is like this is going exactly how I want it I'm not going to ask for 12 1076 even though it'd be totally reasonable and a bargain I'm not going to ask for four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars I'm not even asked for two thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars I'm gonna give you access to everything we talked about today for a single payment of [Music] taking the extra four seconds five seconds when the world is watching I wanted to sit in it and just hold and just like kind of enjoy the moment a single payment of I know what they don't know and I believe that that's how some of the best sales presentations are supposed to be I went from villain to hero in 10 seconds it's free we're already almost halfway on Adam looking good oh thank you thanks sweetie um I appreciate it there were some dark days in the middle of the stack there you gotta touch the bottom of the pool that's what makes it memorable despite all the hate that I was getting I knew the rubber band was going to snap back the moment they saw the truth they just had to wait roller coaster ride [Music] you have no idea like I was so nauseous I think I am gonna throw off I think that more people trust us now to continue to keep our promises in a world that breaks them and more people believe us when we say we are a long-term focused because we didn't take the 50 million dollar payday right there was one comment was actually my favorite comment on all the ones that I that I saw you could have made bank but you chose to make history and I thought that was like that was the [Â __Â ] point like in a statement that was the point good job that was just only two years of Our Lives just about a hundred thousand books sold the first day so offers just sold just under 500 000 copies over two years to sell a hundred thousand in a day was pretty cool to sell 20 of offers of sold big shoes to fill but I actually think that lease with some more copies that offers us and I think that's because more people perceive they have the problem of not having leads than not having an offer the aftermath we're not even done the first week because I'm recording this but my name was trending on all of Twitter the leads audiobook is seven on all of Amazon we went from 50 to 26 on all podcasts we're number one in entrepreneurship we're number two in business like I'm actually like emotional about it something that has never been done before I actually truly believe that what he just did with this launch is going to just have shock waves do you agree with people that are saying that you changed the industry if we're defining change the industry as many people will act differently in terms of how they do business afterwards then I would say yes not everyone but certainly some people will the people who have longer time Horizons who want to build bigger more lasting businesses for sure a brand is based on the associations that people make I knew that having a massive historic event and having the thing still be more valuable than everyone else's and free was something that I wanted to associate myself with but if you measure on a one-year time Horizon then it will never make sense it's cool this is very cool I just want to say thank you guys so much for coming out it means the world to me it's one of those like very small things that Trevor and I spent two years writing this book I just want to say thank you it means a lot to us at the end of the day I will die and on a longer time Horizon I will be forgotten and the only thing that I can say that helped that might be Eternal is skills and education that I can pass on to other people Trevor used to tell me when I was going through kind of like harder times with the edits because it was very tough to edit this book and write this book he said there's a 17 year old who's going to sleep with this book under his pillow to get out of this situation you owe it to him and that's what was kind of like the continuously reinforcing mental frame that I had to that would pull me through it\n"
