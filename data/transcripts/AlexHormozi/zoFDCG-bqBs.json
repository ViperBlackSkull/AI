  "transcript": "you can invest in the S P 500 but I prefer people investing the SME 500s you're always going to get higher Returns on investing in your own education your own skill set compared to any stock market a buddy of mine has a daughter she was working at a bowling alley minimum wage job he told her he's like you know you can triple your income if you just get a certification and become a phlebotomist it takes two days it's 500 bucks by taking 500 she could invest in the S P 500 and at 18 years old maybe there'd be a ton of compounding but if she invests 500 in getting the certification and then two days later she triples her income probably a better investment in buying the certification than forever having a three times higher Baseline for what she can make my belief is always keep reinvesting in skills because that raises your lifetime Baseline of earning potential\n"
