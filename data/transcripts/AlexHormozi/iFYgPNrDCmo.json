  "transcript": "you cannot be CEO of more than one thing no matter how much you want to or how good the opportunity is in my opinion you can only operate one thing very well if you operate two you operate them at a huge decrement if you can run two $1 million businesses by being CEO of both you have the potential to run a $10 million business if you only picked one that's where you make the smallest individual improvements but you get the biggest returns from it\n"
