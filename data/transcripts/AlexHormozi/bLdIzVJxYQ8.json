  "transcript": "so if you go and you hang out with your buddies and all they can really reminisce with you on is the things that you did together but none of them are talking about what they're going to do or what you're going to do for me that's a Telltale sign that they're living in the past they're not even living in the present and so their best years are behind them and for most of us we want our best years to be ahead of us and we want somebody who's also looking at the same goal as us which is growth which is moving forward which is making progress and um if you are a growth oriented individual and you feel like you're not sure about your environment or if it's conducive the easiest liment test is who talks about the future and who talks about the past keep the ones who only talk about the future cut the ones talking about the past\n"
