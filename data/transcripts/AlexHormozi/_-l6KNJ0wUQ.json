  "transcript": "make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no it changed my perspective on how selling really worked which is like you can learn to be exceptional at sales or you can make an incredible offer and it's a lot easier to make an incredible offer than be exceptional in sales it's like a hack it's a shortcut to getting people to say yes is try and find a way to put as much value as humanly possible to actually solve all their problems by making a superior offer you become more persuasive so you actually rely Less on your Rapport building skills or like your obstacle overcomes it's just like make stuff people really want and they'll buy it\n"
