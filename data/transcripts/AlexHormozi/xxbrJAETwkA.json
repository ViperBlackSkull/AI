  "transcript": "so you think a lot of times in relationships people could be spending too much time together absolutely nowadays for sure they live in the same house they literally spent all day together and when we figured this out for our relationship it was still like 2 or 3 years in we actively just like created a ton of space we worked on opposite sides of the house I came off the meetings that she was on and so like at the end of the day we go for a walk 45 minutes I take out my phone she takes out her phone we go through our calendars and we just literally download like how was your day how was my day like what are the things that we're working on and moving forward and that's how we kind of like resync up and then after that we just kind of husband and wife for the the rest of the day\n"
