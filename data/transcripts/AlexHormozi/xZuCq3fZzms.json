  "transcript": "you have to learn how to advertise and then once people engage with whatever advertisement you have you have to sell them so advertising is the first skill selling them is the second skill product would be the third skill which is the thing that you're ultimately advertising and selling okay so that gets us six figures what gets a seven doing the same thing consistently so usually once people do it in the beginning they're sporadic they're not consistent with it just the act of doing the same thing every day usually gets people to 100 000 a month which sounds crazy it's probably people listening but most people who think that's crazy also haven't done it consistently for an extended period of time and so I use something that I call the rule 100 100 minutes of content creation per day 100 reach outs per day 100 of AD spend per day you have to pick one of them but 100 per day you do that for 100 days and I promise you'll be making six figures if you do\n"
