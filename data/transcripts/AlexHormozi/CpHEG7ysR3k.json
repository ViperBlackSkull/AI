  "transcript": "the goal is not to get the person to buy the goal is to get the person to decide and if we can do that you can sell whatever you want people blame circumstances other people and then ultimately themselves and so when we're overcoming obstacles in a sale we have to make sure that we are taking away time taking away money as a reason they can't do it we have to make sure that they don't cast their power to other people and saying I can't make this decision someone else has to make it and then finally when they're with themselves they want to avoid the decision and you have to basically sift through the crap that they're telling themselves about why they can't decide and so if you can structure a conversation that way it's not it's value additive and then ultimately you do make more money but you're not focused on that because you're focused on helping them make the call\n"
