  "transcript": "why is Starbucks a hundred billion dollar company well I'll tell you what it isn't it's not because they have some amazing funnels or some converting landing page or some crazy ad copy it's because their average lifetime value per customer is over 14 000 in five dollar cup increments that's over 2 800 cups of coffee that people buy over the lifetime when they become Starbucks customers and the biggest success that Starbucks did was they realized they needed to find a way to create a product that people wouldn't stop buying so until you get to the point where people continually buy your product over and over and over again and tell their friends about it you should stay at that stage because once you get that crack then you can scale Limitless and you only need to acquire a customer once to keep them for life\n"
