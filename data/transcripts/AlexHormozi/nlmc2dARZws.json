  "transcript": "the big problem that most people have when they are starting their business is that they are in the selling business not in the reorder business they don't have recurring Revenue they have one-time sales so when you see these merch drops and these things where people are just selling crap and they get the one-time purchase and no one buys again the reason they can't make money is because they have no compounding vehicle what that means is that if I sell somebody today I want to get credit for that person that I sold today in a year because what happens is if you don't have that then you're always selling for tomorrow you're always selling for the paycheck this month you're always selling to pay rent rather than benefiting from a sale you made 10 years ago and having that person still pay you today because the thing is that you need to harness time the people who understand wealth understand time\n"
