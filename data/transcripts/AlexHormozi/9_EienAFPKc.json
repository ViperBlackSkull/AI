  "transcript": "most humans eat the same five to ten meals ninety percent of the time if you want to change the way you look you just have to change those five to ten meals that's it and so if you think about what you had for breakfast every single day this week and lunch every single day this week and late night every single day this week most of those times it's only two or three things in each of those little buckets that are actually what you eat so it may sound super overwhelmed like I have to start a diet and I have to start counting calories all you have to do is replace what those five to ten meals are you can change the way you look forever\n"
