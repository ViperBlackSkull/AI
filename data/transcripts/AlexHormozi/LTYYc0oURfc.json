  "transcript": "at what point does taxation become too much you were in an area that was 99 tax you really wanted to live there would you say oh you have to take 100 times more I'd say like how reasonable is it that I can make 99 times more than I can and at what point does this materially affect how I live because then I wouldn't be as wealthy because I don't have all the money in the world I think at this point paying 40 versus paying four percent there's a 36 difference you know it's a 50 increase in your take-home it's material in terms of the number but is it material in terms of how it affects my life and so the math that I did on this was am I going to care if I die worth 10 billion or 15 billion yeah I don't know but I do know that if I talk to my 85 year old self he'd be like did you really spend your entire life where you didn't want to live because you wanted me to have 5 billion more dollars and then he looks at me like I'm an idiot\n"
