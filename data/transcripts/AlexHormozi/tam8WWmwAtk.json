  "transcript": "I think Leela and I have lived our lives very much in acceptance of one another and we respect one another and so I define respect as allowing something to maintain its original function and so like you respect a building by not graffitiing it right you respect your father by like not telling him to change the way he's eating it's like I'll allow you to maintain your function and so we both respect each other that has been the foundation of our relationship we respect and we trust and we trust that the other person is going to try their absolute hardest\n"
