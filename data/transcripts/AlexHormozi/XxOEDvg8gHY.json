  "transcript": "one thing that i do that helps me learn faster and make more money when i buy a book i don't just buy one book i buy two copies of the book i buy a digital book and i buy the audiobook and i actually follow along with the words as i'm listening so i can store it in my blend in two places and on top of that i actually read faster because the audio keeps me moving at the right rate rather than daydreaming and moving on so that's how i absorb way more information than people normally do\n"
