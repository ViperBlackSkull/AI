  "transcript": "here's how you can make crazy claims in your marketing and still be compliant have them be true what that means is you survey your customers on a continuous basis and you survey their stats based on whatever it is the thing that you promise so whether it's weight loss whether it's business whether it's marketing and leads whatever and then rather than say look at Andrea she did ten thousand dollars in ten days instead you Market using just the data of what has happened if you look at Harvard they just publish the stats of what the graduation rate is what the average salary is going out of Harvard and what percentage of people actually land a job within six months of graduation there's no claim there they're just like this is what it is and so if you shift your marketing from this is what could happen to this is what does happen that's where you make the shift from being scammy to being legitimate\n"
