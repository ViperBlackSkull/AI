  "transcript": "when I was 19 years old I was super angry I was angry at both my parents because I was 19 I remember blaming them for everything and I remember realizing that when I blamed them that I gave them control over my life and then the idea that the people that I hated the most at the time were the ones who actually were controlling me was the thing that most sickened me to then actually flip my narrative to actually taking control that was the one thought process like my mother controls this that\n"
