  "transcript": "if you want someone to treat you differently you have to first address it as soon as possible when they do something against it because you want to keep the latency between when they do something you don't like and when you tell them about it as short as you can so that you can actually train the behavior even something as simple as like someone says hey get over here I mean if I'm sitting on the couch and someone says hey get over here I going say don't ever talk to me like that I'm not your dog be like whoa I mean dude no need to have a short fuse I was like I don't have that either I just don't want you to talk to me that way and then it's weird and silent and awkward and then they need to make a decision what\n"
