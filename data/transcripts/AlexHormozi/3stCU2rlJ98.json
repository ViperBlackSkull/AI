  "transcript": "you can absolutely get someone to do whatever you want if you punish them like if I hold a gun to somebody's head that a threat of punishment you can get them to adhere but the moment you remove the punishment or you remove the threat they behave exactly the way they were going to before but if you reward they will always want to have that reward and it does not fade and so if you want the team to continue to act the same way when you are not there then using reward rather than punishment is a better long-term strategy the problem is and this is what confounds everything you can get way faster results with punishment and so you have to be more patient and more willing to continue to invest in people when they mess up not get and continue to only reward the good things so that you Orient their behavior in that way so you get higher Returns on an employee by investing longer in the short term so you get better long-term Rewards\n"
