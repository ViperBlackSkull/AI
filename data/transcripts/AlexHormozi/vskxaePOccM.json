  "transcript": "in your 20s you're young you can around it doesn't matter cuz life is long that assumes that you're not going to die if you're in your 30s you know someone in your high school class who died and it's not just the drug overdose people it's the people who got shot got in a car accident had a weird brain cancer I've had all of those things happen to people that I went to high school with I think it's a little bit arrogant to assume that you're just going to live CU it means you can waste your life I wholeheartedly stand against that the second is that they can do what I would consider dead-end jobs jobs that don't have any direct correlation to your personal growth has nothing do with pay you can work for free and grow more than anyone else but you do need to be setting yourself up for growth in my opinion if you want the big ultimate outcome if you spend the decade of your 20s not growing and not investing in your skills and your education it's just a fact you're going to be a decade behind\n"
