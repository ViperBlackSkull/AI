  "transcript": "if I give away a 10 massage to get people to come in and then later everyone buys packages of massages from me or buys a massage subscription from me the massage subscription or the massage packages are my core offer and the lead magnet would be the trial offer of the 10 or discounted massage the reason people do those discounted massages is because they make more money because if I go up to 100 people and say hey let me give you a massage for 100 bucks a lot of people might say no maybe one person would say us now if I then said I want to give you a massage for ten dollars I might get 20 people to say yes and then of those 20 get a third of them to buy the hundred thing after they tried my massage and so you've got one person getting a massage for 100 versus six people getting a massage after giving them that first trial so if it cost me ten dollars in cost to give the massage then I break even on my lead magnet if it actually cost me 20 I might lose 10 bucks but am I willing to lose 10 bucks on 20 people so I pay 200 to get six customers that convert and are worth two thousand\n"
