  "transcript": "if I believe what I say I do which is that I'm the ultimate judge during an executioner of my own self-esteem then I'm the only person who can say good job or not and unfortunately I have incredibly high standards and so I can either just always feel like a failure because I always fall short of my own standards or I can create a standard that I I willingly and consciously accept which is that I will do enough work that there is nothing left to be done and that means that I can also do fewer things which means I have to be more selective about the things that I choose to do but when I do them they will be done well and they will be done right\n"
