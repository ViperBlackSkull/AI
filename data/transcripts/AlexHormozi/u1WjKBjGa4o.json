  "transcript": "next time you're in traffic you might want to propose so everybody always wants to say like he was on the beach and he was on one knee and there was candles everywhere it's like that's reflective of normal life isn't it if someone's going to say yes to you and it mean it they might as well be able to say yes to you at the grocery store or when you're stuck in traffic because that's what real life's going to be and so I asked Ila to marry me when I walked in the door with no ring and I said I think it would make sense if we got married what do you think and she said yes and then I said cool then I probably should get you a ring and then I went and got her a ring and we were married six days later\n"
