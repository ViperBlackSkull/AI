  "transcript": "but you might have had a tough upbringing you can extrapolate any negative experience to give yourself a shield against any new negatives if you think to yourself none of this is nearly as bad as my dad whipping the out of me or Mom or whatever it is right the point is like we've gone through hardship all of a sudden it just gives you a very different context of what hard feels like what hard feels like is the same whether it's a business heart or an emotional heart it feels the same I think if you can take these past experiences that are hard before and extrapolate them onto your current situation you realize you've been through so much more than this and then you can look back and say like to use the Morpheus quote from the Matrix like I stand Here truthfully and Afraid not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me\n"
