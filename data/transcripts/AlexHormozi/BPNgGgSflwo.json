  "transcript": "Twitter overall was just a meta experiment like I Tweet stuff all day long just as it comes up and when people find something interesting we repurpose the hell out of it they become Instagram posts they become shorts and if we have you know three or four five or six that that do really well around a specific topic then that becomes a long YouTube video and so all of those are just micro experiments and I think if you can create a place where you have low risk to experiment you should lean into that as much as possible\n"
