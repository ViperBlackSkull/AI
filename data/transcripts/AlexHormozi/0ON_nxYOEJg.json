  "transcript": "so many of the entrepreneurs we talked to are making this mistake so I had this many businesses at the same time I wasn't making no money do I think that I could I'm strong enough to own those businesses now but then I wasn't I had to peel weight off the bar until I was left with one and then I did more reps with that one and then I was able to level up my entrepreneurial skill set on a clear opportunity of all of the opportunities that I was best at you have to just say no the opportunities that you have to say no to increase in attractiveness as you get better what happens is you get to 100 then you do another thing and then your attention split and then you can't get past you you have to peel the weight off the bar then you do more reps and so the only reason you shouldn't be doing more reps and adding to the bar adding to the stuff that you sell is that you literally have no more people to sell to and until you have that problem you should focus on the one thing\n"
