  "transcript": "when gym launch took the entire gym Market by storm here's how it actually happened everybody at the time was running free trials they could only spend up to X because cash flow because they had to give 30 days away free and then spend the money on marketing and sales to acquire the customers they're negative for the first 30 days and get a third of those people to then roll into a membership at 99 bucks a month well it would take them three months to recoup that initial cost we were able to take over that Marketplace by simply changing the acquisition model what we did was we had a program on the front end that we charged for up front five or six hundred dollars and our cost to a Car customer was one or two hundred dollars we would make back the cost to hire that customer and the next customer with the 400 left over we were able to fill gyms to full capacity in a month without them having to front the money because they didn't have the money to front so even if they had a thousand dollars a start we'd make more than a thousand dollars back in the first few days and then we could reinvest that to get even more people because the people who are competing against our gyms could only spend up to twenty dollars a lead and we could spend up to a hundred dollars a lead we could out-compete them even if they had better ads than us we had a better business if you can compress the payback period in that first 30 days you win\n"
