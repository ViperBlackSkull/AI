  "transcript": "there's a teacher and he's got two classes that he teaches one class he says the only assignment for this whole semester is that you come back with a perfect clay pot that's it the other class he says your objective is to make the most total quantity of clay pots and you'll be measured by how many pots you make and at the end of the quarter the pots that came from the team that had to just make sheer volume not only did they make more pots but the quality of all of their pots was better compared to the teams that only had to make one and it just underlines the biggest lesson that I've learned in my life which is that volume negates luck\n"
