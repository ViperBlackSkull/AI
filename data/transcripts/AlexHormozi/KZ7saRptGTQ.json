  "transcript": "sleeping on a gym floor for 9 months yeah not fun a lot of people crack the early days up to this like fun Rocky Montage but it was cold and dark and I didn't know anyone and people would drive over the ceiling of the parking garage which is where I was it sounded like a gunshot every 45 minutes so I slept terrible and I was very grateful to not have to do that anymore but every successful person no matter what their story has always done one thing which is whatever it takes\n"
