  "transcript": "you're not afraid of failing you're afraid of what other people will think of you if you fail but if you're afraid of that imagine what they think of you when you aren't even trying oh yeah they aren't I'm such a dick sometimes um is it is it strange to hear your angry toilet tweets read back to you now you know real talk the tweets that I have people don't know this but the tweets are notes to self so they're just directed at me so that I can look back on them and like be reminders of like hey don't do that and so like I think to myself man I'm afraid of doing this and I'm like no I'm not I'm afraid of what this person's going to think about me because if I were to be able to fail in quiet and complete isolation then I wouldn't care and then I think well what if I don't succeed in public what do they think then nothing they don't think about me at all\n"
