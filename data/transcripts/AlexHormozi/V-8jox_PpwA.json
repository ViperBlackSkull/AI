  "transcript": "if your relationship is struggling you're like okay how would I guarantee that I would have a terrible relationship with my wife I would not trust her I would hang out with as many other women that are single ass humanly possible I mean sounds ridiculous but you go down the list it's like okay well if then I wanted to have a great marriage what would I do I'd probably not hang out with a lot of single women if at all I would probably not drink a lot with the boys in environments where she's not with me I would probably extend trust to her so that I don't look paranoid right and so each of those things you just take the negative thing that would guarantee that you'd have a bad relationship and flip it and for whatever reason unbelievably powerful and I recommend it\n"
