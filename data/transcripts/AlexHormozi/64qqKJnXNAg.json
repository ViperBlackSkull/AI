  "transcript": "you can have Rock top moments or Rock Bottom moments I had a different experience which is what I would consider a rock top moment which is is this all there is I had done everything that I was supposed to do I was good at school I was president of the fraternity I was vice president of the powerlifting team and vice president of the newspaper I did the clubs I got the award I got the prestigious job but then I just looked at my life casted out to 30 years and I was like I don't want to do this so I was looking out at my condo that was in a high-rise in downtown Baltimore like looking over everything and I was like very empty and that was when I started thinking it was about a six month window of time where every day I would wake up and just not want to be alive I was like this is uncomfortable enough that I either should choose to stop living or change how I live\n"
