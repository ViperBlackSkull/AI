  "transcript": "the reason that I feel confident about this book that's coming out is I wrote 19 drafts of the book four full rewrites end to end and it's six hours a day from 6 a.m till noon every day for two years to get this book to where it is now when I was done with the book I was like there's nothing else I can do to this like I can't make it simpler I can't make it shorter I can't cut it I can't add a visual that I should have added it's done and sort of the same degree with the presentation that I have I gave myself this framework of like okay well if I were to speak in front of 10 000 people I would probably spend a good amount of time prepping the presentation to make sure it was good only speak in front of 500 000. every single day I do a full draft say the presentation in my head and then I do a second run where I say it out loud and I record it and then after I record it I play the recording with the slides up and I fix every slide where I Stumble or there's something that should be there or Visual and I keep going until there's not much else I can do to it and then when I get up there it doesn't matter if the tech doesn't work or if the book shopping page doesn't work or whatever it is because I'll be able to step off stage and look in the mirror and be like you did everything you could\n"
