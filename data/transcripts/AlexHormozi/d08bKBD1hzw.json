  "transcript": "there's two elements of trying to create fomo there's scarcity which is a function of the number of units and then there is urgency which is a function of time urgency is it doesn't matter how many units I have the deal ends tomorrow I'll give you an example well we have protein it's like well you have protein but I may have a Valentine's Day special that is ending this week with the scarcity component it's a function of units there's always a way to think about it like with the protein I thought of flavors I was like oh just have a limited flavor protein is going to be here but this particular flavor will not be or you can put scarcity in terms of the bonuses you add so it's like I have proteins and they're all vanilla but for this month I'm going to be adding a free workout or a free workout template or a nutrition template that I'm going to add with my protein to create these additional value adds which no one else is doing and then with the additional value add you both add value and create scarcity at the same time to urge the person take action\n"
