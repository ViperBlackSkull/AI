  "transcript": "the easiest question that I like to ask when we're analyzing one of the businesses that we're thinking about purchasing is there a way that we can get someone to buy this and never stop paying for it is there a way that we can make this so good that the moment their card changes or they get a new credit card they call us ahead of time because they don't want to stop receiving value if your phone gets changed your phone carrier and your credit card goes out what do you do you call your phone card you replace it because the value is there if your credit card goes out what do you call Netflix you're gonna make sure that your car goes through if your utilities go out because your car doesn't go through you [Â __Â ] pay if your rent doesn't go through you make sure that it's paid on time because these are things that are valuables that you cannot live without the goal is to figure out a way to make our value so high that people don't want to stop paying you want to be in the reorder not the order business\n"
