  "transcript": "I think about death all the time I saw your post about the queen was she amassed more wealth than 99.99 of the world she ruled for 70 years was a female Monarch which is insane and when I posted it had been I think five or six months since she had died and I was like you probably haven't thought about her today except for this post she probably accomplished more in her life than we probably will so if you are afraid of other people thinking about you just remember that six months after you died they're not going to be that's what I think for me has given me a lot of uh freedom to take big shots\n"
