  "transcript": "be honest who makes views the most important metric you track right a lot of you for this we used to track views as our primary metric but I'm going to give you a good metric that you can track a metric that you might not expect it was ad Revenue so for me I pretty much always ignored ad revenue and just saw it as something that could offset some of the cost of them immedia team there's really nothing else but I was wrong it's actually so much more let's dive into a little bit for a second like how does AD Revenue come to be so it comes from two things this number of views times Revenue per views now the actual term is RPMs which is revenue per meal which is French for thousand but it's number of views times the revenue that you get per view fantastic and this is why this is important because we thought views and that was the only metric we had but we had to have something to counter it because otherwise then you get views for views sake but we needed a quality metric with a quantity metric and so it takes account the quality of the audience which for me was business owners who have amongst the highest spending power and so RPMs are the highest so for me the RPMs go up it means I'm getting more of the quality people that I want so I mean ideally we absolutely want to crank views with the right people and that's what that was able to track for us\n"
