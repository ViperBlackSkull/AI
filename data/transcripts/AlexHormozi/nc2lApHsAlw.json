  "transcript": "don't bet the empire for a pot of gold was a quote that a mentor told me about investing that I've used in a million different situations any number no matter how big it is multiplied by zero is still zero you want to make bets but never let one mistake be enough to undo every right decision you've ever made so if you have a new product or a new venture or nor thing that you're gonna do if you bet the farm on it you better be right and there's no way of knowing you'll be right so in essence even if you bet the farm in the past and it worked it still probably was the wrong decision because if you repeat that decision-making process over an entire lifetime you will end up with a zero because you will be wrong once\n"
