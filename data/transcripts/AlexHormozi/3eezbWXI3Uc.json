  "transcript": "average training sales and training their sales teams backwards rather than teach people about the products you should be teaching them about the prospect because if you understand the prospect you can sell whatever you want if you understand the product you're going to be talking about features the entire time and not listening to what problems this person has and so all the education 80 90 should be about who we are selling to the problems that they are suffering from rather than the products that we are trying to push because if you can perfectly articulate someone's pain to them they will buy whatever you recommend to them because they feel understood rather than trying to get them to understand what you have it's about empathy not teaching\n"
