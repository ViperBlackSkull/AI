  "transcript": "I did a 100 math problems every day so there was this standardized test I had to pass to get into business school and I wanted to score above Harvard's mid score but my score wasn't above Harvard midth score not even close and so I bought every book at Barnes & Nobles it was a stack this big and I went to the math section which was my weakness and I did every problem in there in all eight books over four months and by the time that I took the test I was able to score above that and it was pure violence and I think you can apply that to whatever it is you want to get good at\n"
