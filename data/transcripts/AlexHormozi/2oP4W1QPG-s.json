  "transcript": "how I Define patience is figuring out what to do in the meantime if I tell someone hey be patient I could just say figure out what to do in the meantime like everybody here we're all being patient for our index funds that are appreciating at whatever rate they're appreciating it while we're on this podcast it's not hard to be patient if you figure out to do in the meantime and so there's lots of big goals that take time to accomplish and so me outlining what are the things that I will do to pass the time that hopefully don't take away from my ultimate goal or ideally add to or increase the likelihood that it happens makes a lot easier to be patient in the long term so I'm not really delaying gratification I'm actually finding more ways to gratifying the now that just aren't the big one that comes later\n"
