  "transcript": "you can measure the strength of a brand based on how much more it can charge for a commoditized good so for example if there's a white T-shirt like this or gray t-shirt like this and then this had Louis Vuitton on it it would be significantly more expensive if it's the difference between the commoditized price that anyone can purchase the same good for and what someone else can charge for is how you can measure the strength of a brand and so when we're thinking about our own Brands to see how strong it really is how much more could you raise your price without affecting the demand that will be your answer for how much you need to reinvest in the brand itself\n"
