  "transcript": "I think it's all about opportunities I talk a lot about leverage so the difference between what you put in and what you get out there are a few things that give greater leverage than the opportunity vehicle that you're pursuing a restaurant for example you may work 80 hours a week to make that restaurant successful if you run a platform that creates aggregated buying power for all restaurants to buy together and then you make some sort of spread on that then you still probably work 80 hours a week but you probably have a significantly larger opportunity and so it's just like making sure that we pick you know the right boat\n"
