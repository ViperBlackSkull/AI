  "transcript": "the reason most people aren't successful is they just can't control themselves like that's it it's impulse control they did this research study that said that Ultra successful people have three common traits number one is they have a superiority complex they think they're better than everybody they think they can do bigger things second they have crippling insecurity of not being enough that one hits me and then the third one is impulse control so they know where they want to go they have a way drive to not be a failure and they stay focused on it because of impulse control I guarantee you if you delayed your ass for 5 years and you to provide a value to people you'd have bigger  audience than you what to do with but guess what no one's going to do it and that's why most people aren't successful\n"
