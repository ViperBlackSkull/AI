  "transcript": "how do you measure a brand strength financially and so I see this as how much you can raise your price relative to a competitor's version of your product without losing customers if I have two products that are more or less the same product and I slap my brand on it how much more can I raise my price before losing a customer now you can do this on an individual which would then dictate how strong the brand is with that person or you can do it across many people and say just overall across this audience or this segment we have really strong pricing power and like when you do pricing surveys across like huge populations sometimes it's like college kids their willingness to pay is three times higher than middle-aged moms interesting to know and then you just do some math on like how many of these slices can I cut and how much profit can I get and then you you make your decision based on that\n"
