  "transcript": "we learned this tactic from eminem in eight mile it's using the word but and this is the concept of a damaging admission if i was on a date for example and i was trying to persuade a young lady back in the day before i was married i might say something like listen sometimes i have a temper i can be short at times i don't have a ton of time to get dedicated to a relationship right now because my business is taking up the majority of my time but i'm absolutely fantastic in bed the more negatives i can say in the beginning the more believable the thing that i say right afterwards is and so if i own all of my negatives which is why i love this because be truthful in the things that you're saying that are negative and the more true they are and the more damaging they are the more believable the thing that comes after the sentence\n"
