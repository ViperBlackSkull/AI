  "transcript": "my biggest regret in business was not starting sooner it took me four years to build my first website and the day I actually started to build my first website it took me 10 hours and so the thing is it takes usually about 20 hours to become proficient at any skill we do but most of us myself included wait years to take the first hour and it's not that we avoid learning new skills because we're lazy we avoid learning new skills because we're afraid of sucking and we're afraid of failing and feeling insufficient the more I try and train myself out of that and Associate the feeling of insufficiency with the feeling of learning and growth the faster I've been able to compress the years between when I want to start doing something when I actually start so that when I want to start doing something I actually start immediately so I can start paying down those first 10 or 20 or 30 hours of learning how to do it in the beginning\n"
