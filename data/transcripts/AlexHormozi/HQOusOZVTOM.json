  "transcript": "I've pursued goals in the past and sticking it out has had big payoffs and so when I feel like I'm sticking it out again I'm reminded of the past times I've stuck it out and it's been worth it the hard part is for the people who haven't stuck anything out because they've never seen it work it's like you just have to have faith on some level you just have to believe that it'll work out the thing that carries you over the bridge in the short term is that you are getting better and if you can just focus on that then even if the the crowd doesn't cheer when you give your presentation or you don't sell books or whatever it is you'll know\n"
