  "transcript": "as much as we see bad headlines like this there's actually a silver lining for small business owners which is that really good talent is now back available on the market at reasonable rates now the thing that you should watch out for is if there's a structural layoff as the reason someone went down then they means that they were the bottom 10 so take an extra hard look at those people but companies that cut like an entire department like no more recruiting because we're not hiring there's tons of great people in those layoffs so keep an eye open because I think there's going to be great Buys in terms of talent in the next 24 months\n"
