  "transcript": "here are three things you can use to incentivize people to give you more money today so the first thing is you say hey if you prepay the services with me I'll also add in a guarantee so if someone does a payment plan there's no guarantee if they prepaid there is one the second thing you can do is add a bonus up front so you say hey if you prepay I'll also do this extra thing so you get more for the same amount the third thing that you can do is that you can give a discount for prepayment so maybe 10 or 20 off the total package for prepayment that's fairly common but the nice thing is you can actually combine the first two with the third and say hey not only will I give you a discount I'll also guarantee or not only will I give you a discount I'll also give you this bonus so you're paying less and getting more and so you give people an incentive to pay you more today which improves the cash flow in the business\n"
