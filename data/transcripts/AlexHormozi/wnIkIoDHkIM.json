  "transcript": "the easiest way to make the thing that you have more desirable is by limiting your supply and let me explain so if you have a service business or you sell anything you probably have a cap on how many people you could fill in any given week or any given day and so rather than just let it that be some invisible thing that only you know communicate it directly to the prospector and say hey I can only take on three customers a week and when you say that you inherently limit the supply of your services and whenever you limit something people want it more and so make sure that you communicate your own capacity limitations in a way to actually make your products and services more persuasive and get more people to want to buy\n"
