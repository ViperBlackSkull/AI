  "transcript": "the quality and quantity of metrics that someone explains about how they do their job in my experience is directly correlated with how good they are at the job and so if someone's like hey I'm an amazing HR person and I say cool what metrics do you track and they're like the happiness of the team how many complaints I get on payroll and the order that they tell me the metrics they're looking at and what they track is going to tell me what they care about what they pay attention to and their level of expertise and this applies for everything whether it's somebody who's like in product which is okay what's the activation rate what's their time to value they're start talking in product language rather than like it's got to be clean it's like well how do you measure that how do you know that if you don't then you're just saying words to me to get hired not because you're good\n"
