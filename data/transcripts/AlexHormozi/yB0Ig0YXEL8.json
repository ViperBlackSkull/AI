  "transcript": "punishment changes Behavior faster reward changes Behavior longer it just takes longer to work if someone calls me Alex and I don't like that and I slap them and I say never call me that again I might change their behavior really quickly if I leave the room they might say I was talking to Alex because I'm not there to punish them and so punishment only works as long as the source of punishment is there and the person doesn't get accustomed to the punishment if you're always mean and yell at all of your employees eventually they stop carrying so you have to increase the level of your threats you increase the intensity and the variety of how you claim to punish them\n"
