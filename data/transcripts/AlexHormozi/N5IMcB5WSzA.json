  "transcript": "yogurt stores are making more money on you than you think you walk up and what's the first thing you have you have all the different flavors of yogurt why is that first because yogurt is actually the cheapest thing per ounce for the store but everything's charged at the same price and so they want you to fill up your cup with the thing that costs the least for them that they can charge the most for what's the next cheapest thing that they have well it's the next set of toppings which usually dry toppings they don't go bad they can last longer and they're usually cheaper again that's the chocolate chips the crackers the cookies those things now what's the most expensive thing per ounce well that's going to be all the fruit those things go bad they have to buy them fresh and so they wait to the very end so you've almost filled up your cup and just put a little bit on and that way they can give you the selection but they optimize the process so they make the most profit per cup\n"
