  "transcript": "I finished magum in three years at vanderborg I could earn decent amount of money at most places graduating like that I then took a consulting job that was paid less than most of my other people were because I could work directly with the CEO I then gave up on the Consulting career to do Fitness cuz that was my kind of entrepreneurial thing the first move I made is I asked 40 different gym owners if I could work for them for free I realized that I was going to be getting more out of the exchange than the person who I was working for and so I knew that so I asked to work free and so he started to employ me and he eventually started paying me minimum wage now I would have to swallow my pride in order to take that job but it was one of the best investments I ever made and rather than compare myself to the people who are earning more than me and I'm going to be real with you I did and it hurt but I felt that long term this was going to be more aligned with what I wanted to ultimately do\n"
