  "transcript": "I don't believe that things have inherent meaning I see them much more like the weather some people say sunny days are good and rainy days are bad when they are really just weather because if you are in a drought a rainy day is good flip side would be reversed if it was your wedding the only thing that has happened is just a circumstance or condition and then we ascribe meaning to that thing and so if we can control what that meaning is then it means we can influence our own emotional response to it and if the whole idea of being a good decision maker is controlling our emotional response then having tools like this can be really helpful\n"
