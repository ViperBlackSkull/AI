  "transcript": "I think entrepreneurship in general is a continuous and unrelenting relinquishing of control most people want freedom we have these contrasting values that we are after we're entrepreneurs so we want absolute freedom and then we also want absolute control and you can't have both if you want true Freedom you have to give up control if you want true control you have to give up your freedom and so if everything's dependent on you then everything's dependent on you for me I value Freedom more than I value control\n"
