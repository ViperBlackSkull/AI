  "transcript": "I just hated my job a lot and I hated where I lived a lot and so I was like well I will just not be here don't know what to I'm going to go to but just not this city I went the furthest place from Baltimore which was California and then I was like okay well what do I hate doing well let me not do that and instead I was like I'll do Fitness cuz I like Fitness and I was like at the very least I'll do something I enjoy and if you're like well I don't like doing anything that's impossible because your brain is wired to be rewarded for things and so you are doing things that reward you that's why you do them like everything we do is because we've been rewarded for doing things like that in the past and we project the same activities and we predict that doing things like we did in the past that reward us reward us again in the future that's where our Behavior comes from\n"
