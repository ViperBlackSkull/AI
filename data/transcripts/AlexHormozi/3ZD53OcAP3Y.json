  "transcript": "in order to be able to work on the thing that matters most you need to have free time because then the free time can in real time be allocated to what matters most today rather than What mattered most 3 weeks ago when you booked your calendar Charlie says don't schedule your calendar like a dentist with everything back toback leave room and I would say tactically that is something that I've really committed to for a while now probably for the last 5 years I've always had the first four hours of my day minimum for free and now I probably keep closer to 6 to8 hours in the beginning my day for free and you're like wait 6 to8 hours well yes I start earlier and I end later but I like having my first 6 to8 hours free so that I can allocate that time whatever way I want and to be clear I still work that whole time I just work on what's most pressing for me that day\n"
