  "transcript": "have you ever noticed that some restaurants have a bowl of mints by the door and some give you a mint with your bill it's not just a nice gesture but it's actually a powerful psychological principle to increase profits Studies have shown that when a bill is given with a mint customers give three percent more in tips when two minutes are handled with the bill tips increase by 14 but the most effective version of this principle was when one man was put on the platter and the server walked away only to turn around and put another mint back on there and when they did that tips increased by a whopping 23 percent this phenomenon is known as reciprocity when someone receives something unexpected they feel obligated to return the favor so if you're looking for ways to increase sales start handing out something to your customers before they make a perching decision\n"
