  "transcript": "you can think about the goals that you have and say okay so if I want to go to the gym how do I make it as easy as possible for me to do that well I probably wouldn't pick a gym that's far away I would probably pick one that has a lot of convenient hours I'd probably pick one that has trainers and people that I already like right you see what I'm saying here so the friction is the thing that you attack to make it easy so that you can accomplish the quote hard goals that only look hard to other people who didn't make it easy for themselves and so I think that is one of those easy life hacks that a lot of people underestimate is that they make it hard to achieve hard goals when just think about all the friction points that you have between you and what you want to do and remove them so it makes it easy to hit the goals that you want like no one's a superhero we just try to stack the deck in our favor and I think if you take that notion of make it easy as possible to work as hard as you can and frame it in reference to your goals you'll hit a lot more your goals and you'll be surprised what you can accomplish\n"
