  "transcript": "I had an accounting team in one of our companies who said hey can we have some software developers write some code to automate this task that we do takes us like four hours of manual input every week and I was like wow that's tough and so I went to software developers and I said hey what would it take to do this they're like oh we can do it in 14 days it's 5,000 a day FYI and so the accounting team was like great can you sign off on this it's like okay hold up 14 days time $5,000 70 grand you work for 4 hours a week on this thing you make $70,000 a year so 10% of your paycheck gets allocated towards this task so $77,000 so in order for me to get a return on this 14-day quick automation system it would take me 10 years and that's a pretty shitty return and that assumes that nothing changes over the next 10 years in our business that would cause us to have to update this thing break fix because we switch systems and I think you can get where I'm going with this of course it made no sense but quote systems people will systematize without considering the long-term consequences of why they're even doing it to begin with they just get OCD about and they just want to system everything but all they do is slow people down\n"
