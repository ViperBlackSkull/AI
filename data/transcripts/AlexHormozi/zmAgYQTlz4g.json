  "transcript": "I heard about this concept called open to goal from this chain of gyms that was run by an ex football coach the way that it worked was simple his sales managers required to get a certain amount of sales per day period and the moment they hit that they could cut out they could leave and so they worked every day open to goal and so if goal took 18 hours they worked until 18 hours if the goal took 5 hours they worked till 5 hours but they worked open to goal so you commit to the work until you hit the specific number of outcomes no matter what\n"
