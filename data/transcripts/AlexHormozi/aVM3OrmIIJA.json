  "transcript": "though you've made lots and lots of money you do not want to give any of that to your potential future kids is that correct yeah I think wealth that is given is not a gift I think it's a curse and I think it ends up hurting more people than it does helping because like a lot of meaning in life comes from struggle and work and who we become in the face of stress and hardship I mean one of my favorite quotes is the work works on you more than you work on it to Rob someone of the ability to have struggle in their life might rob them from becoming the person they ultimately should or would want to become and so I think if I have the desire to have my kids become certain types of people then I want to set up the condition so that they become that no one's like man I just want my kid to be rich like no one thinks that they want their kids to be good people and so it's like if you want kids to be good people then set up the conditions that create a good person and that doesn't come from Easy times\n"
