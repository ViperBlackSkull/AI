  "transcript": "ascribing a negative or positive label to an emotional state is in my opinion the biggest plight of the youngest generation you want to draw a line and say any feeling below the line is bad it's like looking at the sky and saying sunny days are good rainy days are bad but they are both required for the earth to continue as humans The Human Experience is the breadth of the experiences not just everything to the left of the line which is why you have these over-medicated kids who think that any bad feeling is bad or rather any feeling that they would prefer not to have as something that they should not have rather than a corrective tool to get them back on the path that they want to be on\n"
