  "transcript": "I remember the first time I made a $500 sale and it took me 30 minutes and I was like every hour of every day this is what I am going to do and anything that is not talking to someone in exchange for them giving me a credit card so that I can charge it and make $500 anything that makes me less than $250 per hour or per per 30 minutes I'm giving to somebody else and so after that first sale I was like I'm never cooking again I'm never going grocery shopping again I'm not cleaning again cuz I knew that in one sale I could pay for that person for the month\n"
