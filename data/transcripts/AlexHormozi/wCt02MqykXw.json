  "transcript": "this guy started a business selling hot dogs and he was given One Wish from a genie of what competitive Advantage he would be able to have the first thought he had was like maybe I'll make my hot dogs cheaper the genie shook his head and was like no what if I made my hot dogs taste better and the genie said no don't waste your wish on that or the guy's thinking maybe I'll just make mine the fastest cooking so I can serve the hot dogs faster the genie said that's not what you want to waste your wish on so the genie looked at him holding the hot dogs and buns in hand and said it's not about the hot dogs if you want to build an amazing business you want to put your hot dog stand on the best corner in front of a starving crowd because if your hot dog stand is on the corner it doesn't matter how cheap they are how good they taste how fast they cook the moment that hungry crowd walks out and sees your hot dog stand you're going to sell it every time\n"
