  "transcript": "I made 35,000 posts over 40 months and grew a 7.8 million person audience and 3 weeks ago I made six big shifts in my content and I want to show you behind the scenes what we found from those six big shifts with screenshots of the data so that you can use this to make more money in your business and whatever you promote and so the first was we went from edutainment to education so instead of being kind of halfway through to all the way all in on education now that had Downstream impacts in terms of how we packaged how we title things even the number of special effects we have and the purpose of Education as I see is to change behavior and so my point is with this video once I show you the data of what's happened since that change since the we made these six shifts that hopefully or hopefully not we'll see what you decide to do but it will change how you make content to make more money so number one is educa edutainment to education number two is went from for us to for you now when I say for us what ended up happening with the mistakes I made was that I mean unknowingly was that I would be like team what do you guys think about content and so they'd be like hey we should make a video on this hey we should make a video on this and so what end up happening is I started making videos for my team not my ideal customer a business owner and so I actually had a friend come into town and say Hey you know it's weird I actually haven't been paying attention to your content he does about 10 million bucks a year and uh I was like he's like well I guess I'm not really your avatar and I was like who I was like you are 100% my avatar what's going on and so as soon as I realized that I was like oh man he's like it just didn't feel as relevant to me and so I was making stuff for my team rather than my avatar and so if you are somebody who makes content something to be mindful of is your team might not be the type of people you're trying to make content for so just something interesting for me so went from for us our team to for you viewer for business owners number three we went from wide to narrow so Fitness relationships Etc there are wider topics more people are in relationship more people eat food more people trying to lose weight compared to only 9% of people are business owners and so we went much narrower on the topic of like I'm just talking about business because that's what I love talking about too as a side note and so it turns out business owners like it more when I talk about business and I like it more as a business owner so everybody wins at least for me number four is we went from views to revenue now this was key so when you just have views as a metric then you kind of do Chase wider because it was the only real metric we were tracking and we didn't really have anything better at the time and that's we focused on since then we've transitioned to ad revenue and here's why ad Revenue takes into account views but it has a second metric that's paired with it which is RPMs which is revenue per thousand eyeballs so if you if YouTube pays lots of money for the eyeball then it means they're more valuable and if they're more valuable to The Advertiser they're more valuable to me and so my idea here is that I want to make sure that we're showing our videos to the right people or rather that the right people are watching now once we can control for that and we stay our keep our RPMs or the amount that advertisers are willing to pay for these eyeballs High then we get as many views as we can and as a total Pro tip for business stuff in general paired kpis Works exceptionally well so if you're in customer success you want the speed of resolution but you also want a quality metric if you had a a company that did cleaning it' be the same thing is you'd pair reviews from customers with the number of cleans per day and so you like to have both edges so that you can control for both sides and you should do that with any Department you can now so I said number four was views to ad Revenue as our primary metric that we were optimizing for so we no longer care oh this one had a lot of views we don't care about that it's just do we have as many views with the right people number five is from emphasizing shorts to emphasizing Longs we saw that longs got the best people and short the whole thesis around shorts creates Longs viewers we actually haven't seen any evidence that supports that people watch shorts want more shorts people want Longs want more longs which doesn't necessarily mean that people from a different platform don't watch you on shorts on Tik Tok and then they're a long form YouTube Watcher and then watch your stuff on YouTube that long but usually people who watch long form stuff on YouTube watch long form stuff on YouTube people watch short form on YouTube watch short form some people watch both but most of the time people kind of have consumption preferences and they're not going to change the preferences for you they just might watch you in a different place where that consumption preference is what you make and so we found that and we found that the Longs are the things that actually drove the the most applications for acquisition. comom and the most Book Sales and the most optins so that's what we're making more of and number six was assuming more versus assuming nothing meaning I made videos like the Alex Heros diet I made uh the the Alex Heros Vlog the herois things like that those assume that somebody who doesn't know me will want to care what whoever the hell Alex rosi is which I don't think is that reasonable like I don't think they would want that cuz who cares about this random dude and so it's assuming nothing now that has um changes in terms of what we're making so there's no assumptions so for example like we own acquisition. comom we have pfolio businesses I introduce myself because if you don't know who I am this might be the first video you see me and so if I stopped doing that for a while because I kind of went into this mindset that every everyone knew now obviously that's dumb way more people don't know me than know me but you kind of fall into this trap of assuming you're talking to your warm audience rather than what you're making the content for which is people who've never met you before and so keeping that top of mind which is that we want to make sure that we welcome everyone and that we don't have inside jokes that only people who are on the inside feel it because then all it does is it excludes people that are new and like what you want to do is bring more people into your world anyways especially if they're business owners for me and so there are the six changes that we made in our content and so we've gone all in on that concept and so we've done a lot of Rapid iteration but let me tell you the data that's happened since so right off the bat RPMs meaning the revenue per thousand viewers went up by 68% so like when you think man I don't feel like I can like what my content is about like it doesn't change anything well it sure as hell did for us when I talk about deep business stuff when I talk about reducing TR when I talk about increasing number of time like ways to get someone to buy more times when I talk about how we scale a 40 person sales team and the all the steps that we did in order to do that in a real case study in a real business when I talk about how you can deconstruct and reconstruct a brand these are a deeper business Concepts and guess what business owners watch them and guess what those eyeballs are more valuable 68% and we're only going to get better at it and so for us boom that meant that US changing our topics got the right people to watch the videos checkbox one and so you can see by the video title when we had educational versus kind of wide or business education versus wider topics The Wider topics in general had way lower RPMs you can see that with the the light blue whereas the purple is more money-making more business more sales more more you know retention real business tactics that grow companies and those unsurprisingly were way higher in average RPM some of them even higher than that so the next big change and I see this as anecdotal is that 25% more comments per view and so I see that as an engagement metric that we had way more people saying wow this was good or this was great or I missed this style of content that's actually a really common thing and I will say this this is to my this my decrement I should have seen that more business owners were telling us in the comments what they wanted and honestly I just wasn't listening um and that's on me I I was like well you're going to lose some people as you make more you know high production stuff that's okay but with the return to hardcore business education in terms of the content that we're making the response has been overwhelming that so many people were like I'm coming back to all your content this has been great this is what I came here for and so I'm stoked about that and so we got 25% more people who are uh doing that we have more shares negligible and slightly fewer likes which again whatever but for me I would say com I would rate comments and shares as higher and so overall we had higher engagement from these videos even though they were narrower topics which to me is more good for fewer people than a little bit of good for a lot of people which is where I want to be in terms of what I want to serve or who I want to serve so the next big change is that despite and this is a key Point despite having fewer absolute views per long form video we're actually getting more long form views overall across the channel so we're up 30 almost 30% 29.56 per um then our our six weeks average before that from these deeper educational videos now realistically that's a function of one main thing in my opinion that's because the education stuff actually requires far less post editing and I can make more education stuff because this is what I do every day and so we can actually create more content which I'm stoked about and I think the I think I mean hopefully business owners are too um and so we actually get more overall views with the right people because we don't have nearly as much highi post production whizbangs which is what most of my audience who was trying to learn stuff rather than be entertained was happy about all right this next one is very surprising to me at least so our subscriber conversion increased by 24.6% and so that means that we've actually like even though again we had slightly lower lower absolute views more long form views that we actually increased the absolute number of subscribers per week since doing this so like I mean I was very very comfortable with all of these metrics tanking like that was I honestly expected that because I was like all right well we're going to have way fewer viws but it's going to be the right people but because 25% more people who watch subscribe even though we get fewer views our actual subscriber growth has grown which is crazy in an absolute metric way so this was this was an unexpected outcome for me and has just reinforced that this was the right decision for the audience that I want which is business owners the next thing is like okay well if you're getting fewer views how is that going to translate to optins because I'm a business owner like that's what I care about I care about people who are trying to uh to become portfolio companies come to a workshop whatever and so it turns out that we have 26% more optins per week since making this change and so this is like both incredibly surprising and also incredibly duh and I say this because like saying hey I'm going to make business owner stuff to get more business owners duh but at the same time I'll would say this just me kind of commenting on a lot of the Educators that are in the space they tend to start moving more and more broad more and more wide more and more entertainmente more and more topics that they don't necessarily have expertise on because they seek the views whether they say it or not they don't want to say they like likees saying cash they still kind of Count Their likes and so I think if you can just absolutely get your logic head on which is tough because sometimes you it's it's tough to to go away from those vanity metrics but I care about the bottom line and so the right people were seeing it and the right people were taking action and so we in in the the business sense saw growth from this in a big way and this is just like 3 weeks in four weeks into this kind of execution all in on this strategy and this will compound and so for the don't know I have two bestselling books on Amazon they're still like number one and number two on marketing and sales and they've been there for like number one and number two for two years or three years or whatever how they've been out so they're pretty strong and so we sell books every month no matter what but what was crazy to me was to see this jump in Book Sales that happen as like think about this we're getting fewer View use but more sales by a lot like 2x the sales twice not like 20% twice the sales of books that I have and mind you by the way if you're like hey I'm poor I get it my books are free too they're by like you can go to a.com and you get the video course all my stuff for free you don't have to opt in and you can go uh on my podcast and you can listen to the audiobook for free all right like this stuff's free this isn't how I make my money but it's a really good leading indicator for me of the quality of traffic now if you want to get a physical copy yes there's printing cost and there's shipping cost so yeah you pay some bucks but if you're dead broke poor you can use the free stuff the point is is that this attracted the right people people who want because if I make a fitness meals video guess what those people don't care about getting leads and making offers kind of sounds obvious when you think about it when I make a hey this is how I work with Lila my wife maybe you get somebody who's like what about the married entrepreneurs it's like well only 9% of people are business owners and then of that 9% how many of them are married to to their partner percentage or percentage versus just talking about business stuff business people want to get more leads make more offers make more money and so that's what my books are about and so lo and behold more of those people bought now I want to be super clear I want to show these two these two Keynotes here so there are some Keynotes that will be both deep and wide and as a content creator business owner slash investor slash husband slash human being anyway boy big um sometimes you hit it out the park and you actually get both so my highest revenue revenue perview video also happens to be my most viewed video and so it doesn't necessarily mean that if you have a lot of views the RPMs are low no not at all you can get a video that applies to all business owners and it will get a lot of views and the cpms or the RPMs will be high The Branding video is the same thing that it's very recent it's new and it continues to climb up um and there both of these are very conceptual business Concepts that all business owners can benefit from and so if I talk about leverage almost all businesses need to understand strategy and leverage it applies it's a huge amount of value to business owners understanding brand tremendous value to any business now on the other hand you can also make and we have we call these Keynotes but like longer form either whiteboard presentations or like a presentation that I put a lot of time into um some of them are going to be deeper and less wide and that's okay like if I talk about scaling a 40 person sales team if you have an e-commerce store doesn't affect you but leverage and brand would affect you whether you had the 40 person sales team or the e-commerce company or a software company or an app or whatever and so again the scaling for 40% sales team still super valuable but it's just going to be only you know valuable to onethird of the business owner audience that I might be able to you know who might want to watch this same thing with um same thing with the video I've made about texing your business overnight by using using Mega influencers basically showing how to get a Mr Beast A Logan Paul a rock to partner with a Conor McGregor a Huda Beauty a Taylor Swift to partner with to 10x your business now if your business like a local business the likely that they're going to partner with you is really low right and so it doesn't really make sense for that particular business now you could use that on a micro scale but it might just not have as much transference if you have an e-commerce brand that's National might make a ton of sense but again it's going to have a sub segment of already a 9% slice of the population that it would be deeply valuable to though and so that's the thing is is that I have to think about like I'm okay with a video that gets 10,000 views instead of 400,000 views if 10,000 of those people are $10 million plus business owners it's like here here's how I packed my company in order to sell it I have a video on my channel that walks through 46 minutes of the decision-making process I used to determine to sell my business guess who that applies to basically no one unless you actually have a lot of money and you already have a business asset that is5 million in profit or more and so let's see 9% of businesses it's like .1% do $10 million a year of businesses so there's like no one who that actually applies to except for those people or like this thing was amazing this changed my life and I had a bunch of people after I posted that that I know that were big 20 30 $40 million year business owners who watched the video like this is insane I can't believe you gave this out I'm like believe it because guess what no one else is going to watch it and so I will say this this is me giving you like a little hat tip for consuming if you're a business owner I would not gauge views as whether the whether the video is good or not it just shows how relevant it is to how many people and so if you an e-commerce person I have some videos in here about how to use offers for e-commerce that's just already going to be a slice of a slice but it'd be super applicable for you and so I'm okay with very small views as long as the quality gives value and provides a result result in a clear way for the viewer and so I Define education as change of behavior so if I can help them change their behavior in a way that makes them more money ideally they'll associate that money they made that value they made with us at acquisition. comom and so that's the whole goal of this stuff and for the creators out there or those of you guys who are making content in order to promote your business I'll give you this Frame that I started out with that helped me a lot which is you know when I posted my first you like I started at zero on every platform to be very clear here like it wasn't like I was tailor Swift and I came on Tik Tok yay right it wasn't like that when I started on YouTube I had no subscribers and the First videos I posted got like a hundred views right but I thought to myself I was like man if I like I would probably go across town to speak to 100% audience for lunch and I'd have no problem with that and so the idea that I had a hundred people I was like that's not bad even if there's 10 people I'm like well I would talk to a 10 person I mean I used to do this for years I would do a lunch and learn and uh see if I could sell some weight loss you know what I mean like I was willing to do that anyways and so there's this it's be it's literally just because of comparison that people feel bad about their social media content not because inherently the numbers don't make sense and the crazy thing about this and I just want to reemphasize is it's free it's free the platforms distribute your content for free these are people that would never found out about you and they find out about you for free like take that in for a second so the leverage on free distribution is infinite and so if you get a thousand people over a month who see your thing it's a thousand people it's not nothing and so I try to make sure that I focus on that concept of like oh man my average for the channel is 400,000 and we got a 50,000 view video 50,000 my God I speak at conferences with a thousand people it's 50 times that not bad and those people I got to have a really really curated experience increase the value per second absolutely Crush as much value as I possibly could in that in time period And so I'll make one last note on uh on the Deep versus wide content is that I get get so many DMS and like slack messages even from our portfolio company Founders who were like dude that last video was so sick and I hadn't had that in a minute for probably the the six months where we went a little bit wider with our content and it became so reinforcing for me even though like what's the what's the number of people I don't know 50 people maybe messaged me being like dude that new like your new content style or going back like the new old content of more whiteboard more deep business tactics like it's so great my team's watching it again that like fills me up CU that's why I made the stuff to begin with was the stuff that I didn't have when I was coming up that I wish someone had taught me and then I had to just find out through trial and error and so that's why we make this stuff but the views weren't high but for me like I'm here for business owners and I already know there's only 9% of people are business owners and that's okay I'm for I'm here for you guys all right so here's what we're doing next with this data all right so we had our hypothesis we looked at the 35,000 posts we made these six big shifts and buy and large we have crushed the hypothesis so I'm actually like I was telling my team yesterday I was like we're kind of lucky that this worked out the first time because like I'm not really used to things working out the first time more more like realistically like hey we made this change and then like four of the six stats are bad and two of them are good and so we're like all right well these ones are good so let's try and keep this stuff the same and we got to tweak all these other things our view to subscriber ratio is higher our absolute subscribers are higher optins are higher book sales are higher applications are higher and it's about stuff I like making so I'm like I'm thrilled to I'm stoked and I get to make this stuff about like we can do more content because I don't have to put as much post into it for you guys so like you guys said it's more distracting to have the whizbangs and the effects and we're like cool I'm happy to just talk business so this is what we're doing now so one big belief we have is volume NE Gates luck that's in the sales team locker room same thing in the media team is that we will we will create more and we will just basically have constraints on where like the direction of what we're creating but we will keep we will keep as much as we can in different ways to find out works even better than our first whack at it the second thing is don't get the same scar twice we're super happy to make mistakes I mean I I it's funny I even I I I almost mean that like it's totally fine making mistakes it's like they're not mistakes they're just lessons what we don't want is to get the same scar twice and so if we find out or we know that I have to introduce myself then I better keep introducing myself if we know that high Hi-Fi production doesn't do as well with business owners then I better not do that right unless there's a conclusion that we find that's wrong about that but for now like that's what we're not going to make the same mistake twice and so I'm happy to make all the mistakes there are in a very narrow field that's what makes an expert um but I just don't want to make it twice a third one this is super tactical is that uh slides versus just me heavily prepping for a presentation hasn't made as much of a difference so I tried to approximate this by like my best videos that were most views and most business Centric in terms of cpms was me presenting at a conference so I have a stage in my headquarters and so I was like all right I'm going to present on my stage but it was to it was not to an empty room it was to my to my team but like a lot of comments were like is this guy pretending to be on stage and so if you did see that that's why it was uh that's why the the room was kind of empty um but I was like I was trying to approximate as much of that style of video so that gives you maybe a little bit Insight I was like okay what can I control I can do a stage we can do the lighting we can have the seats I can have slides these all things that I'm used to doing now it worked to degree but we got the same performance from me just talking to red camera like this and going over the slides without the stage uh or me just doing whiteboard of walking through the concepts or the tactics to grow or solve a problem number four show what only you can show and say what only you can say and so I have I have a few marketing isms that I have never heard anywhere else that are like very real for me one is State the facts and tell the truth it's always that way because then you never get in trouble you have to worry you don't have to worry about claims you just State the facts and tell the truth also means that you have to go collect data so you can State the truth um and so a second one underneath of that is say what only we can say and show it only we can show it's demonstration right and so if obviously I have accomplishments that I can say hey I know what I'm talking about but there's also labor and so I could say hey I built a 8 million personal audience listen to this stuff for Content which by the way you don't have to listen to any of it this just worked for me um or I can say I made 35,000 posts independent of the outcome and so what I want to do is do more work than anyone else will do so that I can show what no one else can show and say what else can say and so if you're starting out or you're you're a different part in your journey considering like okay well I can't out outcome anyone yet because I'm early but you can outwork people and so I can just say like I made 35,000 post what I learned I'm going to compress a lot of time for you that's valuable no matter who you are and number five is still doing wide shorts so this is interesting so we thought about this and we decided that for shorts we're willing to go a little bit wider and I'll tell you why so I run ads and Lila runs ads using our face and I actually see the main Roi from shorts as top of funnel brand awareness and when I say brand awareness I really just mean like facial recognition people will see my face and remember that they got some sort of value from it and in a short it's more difficult to get into really deep business Concepts which is what I'm um not to stes Impossible and maybe I just need to up my skills which is totally totally fine um but we're still maintaining a certain percentage of shorts that I would consider to be more like um a little bit wider because I tend to like business philosophy too and I don't want to stop like one are the things I like talking about I like philosophy I like wide business Concepts I like personal development instead of in terms of like productivity which is T of kind of a wider topic but I'm not going to stop doing that because I do like making that stuff and so I'll probably keep having shorts around that because the ROI is actually not from shorts turning into book sales or shorts turning into optins it's actually the shorts getting retargeted later with an ad that does go to something but they're going to be more likely to recognize me and then take the next step in whatever whatever the funnel is whether we're saying hey if you're starting a business go check out school which by the way again wide if someone's trying to start a business then it makes sense for it to be a little bit wider for people trying to get into it and so then the school ads can hit those people and it makes sense for them to use school right uh if it's a business owner I still think that from a business perspective we have a lot of business content in terms of our shorts but I want to just address this in case you see it so you're not confused about it I still will have some wide content in short form um because of the reason that I just said and so those are the kind of like the next steps and if you guys find these kind of updates valuable with the metrics behind it um the tldr of this whole video is that what we said worked and if you're an educator toss out the views focus on your customer make stuff for them because likes ain't cash views ain't cash cash is cash and so if you're trying to grow your business make sure you're making the stuff for the people you actually want to make now here you go\n"
