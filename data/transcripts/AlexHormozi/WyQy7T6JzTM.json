  "transcript": "if we have an unbranded t-shirt for $5 and we say you know what we think we have a strong enough brand that we can raise the price and then boom we can raise the price and still not lose that many sales but we 12x the price good branding drives that premium pricing good branding also improves advertising so with the generic brand if you're marketing this white T-shirt you might get half a percent of people there are many white t-shirts there are many like it this one is mine just kidding so so if you have a 05% clue rate on something that's generic there's nothing special about it on the flip side if you have a Nike Brad t-shirt same identical t-shirt and it has the swoosh now you might get six times as many people to click and buy at a higher price see how these things stack together that is why these Brands exist for such a long period of time and make so much money\n"
