  "transcript": "to me I would rather have died and I mean that genuinely because when I left my white collar job it was because I didn't feel like being alive anymore and so I know what that road looked like and I know where it LED and I didn't want to go there more than I felt the pain of the failure in the short term and so to me going back to the white collar job was never an option on the board one of my favorite sayings and the things I used to think about a lot was during my harder times I always kept repeating myself like if I do not quit I cannot fail like I'm not a failure only like the day I give up is the day I fail but if I keep in it I keep playing no one can say that I failed and I won't say that I failed\n"
