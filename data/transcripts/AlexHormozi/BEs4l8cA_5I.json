  "transcript": "most people don't allocate their time well if you still have your level three job you can still spend your other hours of the day learning whatever the new thing that you're passionate about is and usually if you spend the other hours of the day doing that you're going to quickly level up your skill faster than you are on the main skill because you're not really investing in yourself on that side and so wherever you're attention goes money will follow you invest on that new thing until eventually maybe you're level two or level three of that thing and then all of a sudden you can make a horizontal swap in income without having to sacrifice lifestyle\n"
