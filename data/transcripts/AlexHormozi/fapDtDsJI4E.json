  "transcript": "I have one Central person that I was trying to prove for a very long time which was my father he disapproved of my whole thing and for 5 years we didn't talk very much and so he calls me up he says hey you're going to want to sit down for this and so he says I'm sorry for everything like he's a middle eastern father born in Iran where my father was born women weren't allowed to drive cars cars came with drivers with them when you bought them he was born in a very different world fathers don't apologize to Sons it just wasn't that way and I can see that now and so rather than take it for the Olive Branch that it was I said I didn't care about opinion 5 years ago when I left and I don't care now and he was like well we'll see how long your success lasts but the the main point there was that I did everything that I've done to this point to beat my father when I really start thinking about it I'm like I like who I am he raised me so doesn't that mean that he might have been the perfect father\n"
