  "transcript": "the easiest way to get a job at acquisition.com or really any great company do the work that you're actually good at ahead of time on behalf of what you would start doing in the role if you're good at web design you could like redesign some pages and send it in if you're really good at creative stuff like you could take raw content edit it and then send it in so the whole risk is like what if they come in and they suck well they're going to see your work ahead of time and if you do that to a hundred jobs then you also get practice the whole way through of actually just doing more reps so you're really working on you more than you're working for them if you think about applying for jobs or getting jobs as cold outbound which is exactly what it is cold outbound benchmarks are about one percent as in if you reach out to 100 people you get one sale and so I think that most people need to start thinking about jobs that same way which is if you apply to 100 companies you're likely to get a job especially if you actually take time and don't just click apply send resume apply send resume and never do any personalization so just don't be lazy\n"
