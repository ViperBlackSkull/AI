  "transcript": "so I think it's human behavior and so the the way that we describe this is local versus global benefit a simple example is like if I want to have a six-pack why does Sarah go grab a piece of cake rather than grabbing a piece of chicken breast because the local benefit the acute benefit of having a piece of cake is higher in the small in the local region yeah but the global benefit for her body is lower and so humans in general will tend to optimize for local benefit rather than Global and the people who can simply optimize for Global benefit for their system-wide benefit are the ones that get the biggest compounding returns over the Long Haul\n"
