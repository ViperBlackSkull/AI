  "transcript": "like when I was 19 I did a swimming only thing I did kettlebell only I did body weight only I did power lifting but the thing that I ultimately ended up on was I just like the combination of strength and bodybuilding I never competed in bodybuilding but I enjoy the style of training do the one that you're actually gonna keep doing because if you think about it on a long long time Horizon the only thing that'll really matter is the thing that you do for the rest of your life because if you only get in shape for 12 weeks who cares\n"
