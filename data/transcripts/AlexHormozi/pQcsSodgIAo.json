  "transcript": "everyone is unhappy because they say they want to be happy happiness I said it once and I was like you know I don't know if that's true anymore I was so against happiness as a concept for a very long time it's part of my identi like I'm not a happy person that's fine stating that got me out of all the pressure I would put on myself for not being happy so I was super unhappy and then I would put pressure and have anxiety about why I wasn't happy then I came up with happiness as my Mantra and I was like I'm just going to do and then I kind of forgot about happiness as a concept for a while but I identified with somebody who wasn't happy and that that was okay and that gave me a lot of Peace but then I realized like a couple years ago I was like I'm I'm actually pretty content I'm pretty good I like what I do every day like I like who I do it with I like what we do I'm pretty good\n"
