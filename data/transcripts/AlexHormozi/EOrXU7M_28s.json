  "transcript": "which type of entrepreneur are you are you more of a promotional entrepreneur so you love the sales and the marketing and selling the franchises selling the franchises or are you more of a product-driven operational leadership driven entrepreneur who's like cool with a longer time R and just loves investing in people and building kind of a big thing if I look at an entrepreneur and they're super promotion driven they love selling they love they love the sizzle they love the the hunt right of selling franchises then franchising when I'm at 50/50 might still be the right play on the flip side if there's somebody who's a little more product driven a little more leadership driven like love the Ops all that kind of stuff then it might be more of a self-sustained lower number higher value play\n"
