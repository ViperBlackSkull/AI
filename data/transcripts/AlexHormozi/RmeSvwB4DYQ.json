  "transcript": "if you want to get lots of protein for cheap and fast this protein bomb is the way to go all right so I use zero percent fat Greek Faye because it has 80 grams of protein and 450 calories 30 grams of carbs plus if you had a calorie free Crystal Light packet or Mio water flavoring it tastes just like Yokai it's nuts and if you want to take it up even further you can sprinkle some Frosted Flakes or Rice Krispies or my personal favorite Fruity Pebbles on top for some crunch so it's a protein bomb you can make in 15 to 20 seconds and you can even eat it while you work when you're traveling whatever\n"
