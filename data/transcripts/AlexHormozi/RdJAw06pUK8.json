  "transcript": "people make a purchasing decision based on their prediction that they will get value and access of the cost of the purchase for example when I would sell weight loss I would say like well what did you do so far and they would usually say some sort of Fitness thing some sort of nutrition thing whatever and I would say well it sounds like you've never had Fitness Nutrition and accountability together you've had one or two of the three but not all three together and that for most people was an epiphany where they're like you're right I've only done just a diet thing or I've only done just a workout thing and so that was value and then they were like wow that's a new perspective a new paradigm now I believe and I will predict if I continue to work with this person I'll continue to get more value\n"
