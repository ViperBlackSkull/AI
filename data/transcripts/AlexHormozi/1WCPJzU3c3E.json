  "transcript": "so the best mantra that i have for learning new stuff is that you replicate before you iterate copy it before you make it your own and the way that you make it your own is that you copy three four five different people's stuff and then when you combine your learnings from those five you'll have something that's unique that's your own and if you look at the greatest artists of all time you look at picasso look at da vinci this is how they teach artists they duplicate what another artist was able to do their style and then they mix it and they make it their own and that's how you learn in business and that's how you learn in life\n"
