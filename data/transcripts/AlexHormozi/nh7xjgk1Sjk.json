  "transcript": "what is the list of activities that if I saw somebody who is not me do these things I would think that it was unreasonable that they would not succeed over a long enough time Rison if I had to guarantee that somebody else would be successful what would I tell that person to do if they've got a family it's like they got to wake up at 4:00 they got to work the first 6 hours before going to work and they got to do 100 Reach Out connections or they got to you know make 100 minutes of content or they have to run a certain amount of paid ads every day they got to make a certain amount of calls to to follow up with leads if they were to do those activities four 5 years straight the likelihood that they would fail would be virtually zero and so I make that list and I think okay that's what I'll commit to and the outcome will take care of itself if I commit to the activities and then my success or failure depends on whether or not I held up my commitment to those activities so it feels 100% within my control\n"
