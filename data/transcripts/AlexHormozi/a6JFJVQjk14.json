  "transcript": "here's a way to guarantee that you'll never have enough money always spend more than you make and so you take the inverted thinking process and you apply to that rule number one which is it doesn't matter how much money you make as long as you spend more than you make you'll always feel poor and on the flip side doesn't matter how little you make if you spend less than what you make you'll always feel rich you'll always have more than enough and so it's like well why not set up the game to win no matter what and then do everything else after that\n"
