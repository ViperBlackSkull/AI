  "transcript": "it's impossible to control a man who needs nothing when a person eliminates desire they destroy the influence anyone and anything has over them so if you no longer need validation you can pursue that new thing you can eliminate desire in two ways you can work on your head so that you need nothing and you eventually become a Buddhist monk or you can satisfy your initial desire so that you are an individual unit you are not incomplete you can function on your own if you're an individual person you can add value to the relationship but you do not require their validation and then you can actually pursue whatever it is that you want rather than wondering if you're fulfilling someone else's dream\n"
