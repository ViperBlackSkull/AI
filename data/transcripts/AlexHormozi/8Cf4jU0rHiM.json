  "transcript": "if you're a chronic career Hopper usually it's because you have one of two problems either you don't know how to properly identify opportunities and so you keep picking the wrong thing or the wrong place to work because you're not looking at other things so you might be like well this place offered me $17 more a year and so even though these people seem really nice and these people seem terrible I'm going to take these people so you might have a terrible decision-making process the other is that you just have unrealistic expectations of work which is that it's going to be a fairy land and you're going to enjoy every single part of it and that's just not true like no one loves when 100% of everything they do\n"
