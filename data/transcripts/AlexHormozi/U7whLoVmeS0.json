  "transcript": "I live more or less the same day seven days a week I wake up and then I go to my office here and I work for six hours writing my next book and then I take 2 hours is of calls typically and then after that I lift in the gym that I custom designed with all the pieces that I love and then I go and eat with my wife and then I go to my condo and I sit in my recliner that overlooks the entire city and I read and then I go to bed and I do that every day and I love every aspect of the day with the exception of maybe the two hours of calls that I have to take but I see those as a necessary thing for everything else that I have there now could I stop doing that maybe but for me to say that that's what your day needs to look like in order to get into the top floor with the view that looks over these things and so that you can not make money for two years while you write a book that eventually makes money or whatever is is not true\n"
