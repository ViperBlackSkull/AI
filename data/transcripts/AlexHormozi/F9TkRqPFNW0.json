  "transcript": "if you're thinking about getting into business and you're not sure where to start the business you get into is not going to be the one you end up with there's this idea that you need to have the perfect pick the fallacy of the perfect pick for a new entrepreneur and that's why they get so obsessive of bouncing between thing and thing because they think the thing is the thing that matters but it's them that matters like if I start a la care company I can get it to a bil I can do that if you do stick with whatever you do on a long enough time rise it and take feedback and improve it's very tough to beat if you keep improving 10% 20% a year 20% over 12 years is 10x and so if you're like I'm making a million you're at 10 million but then thing if you do that again you're a sense a millionaire\n"
