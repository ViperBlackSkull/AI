  "transcript": "the time to document your life is when it sucks not when it's great it's the times you're sleeping on the floor it's the time the person walks out and you miss the seventh sale that day it's the time when your bank account's at its absolute lowest it's when your car breaks down on the side of the road and you're like what am I going to do now I can barely afford this right those are the moments the ones that you want to ignore the ones that you want to look away from that are the ones that you need to capture because those are the moments that you will tell in the future of things you got through because no heroes are heroes without Epic monsters and the bigger the monster the greater the hero\n"
