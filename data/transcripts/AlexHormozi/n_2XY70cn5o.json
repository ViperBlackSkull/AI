  "transcript": "the most successful entrepreneurs that I've encountered are a lot like Yeti mugs and hear me out so you know there's mugs that in the middle they can stay hot or they can stay cold independent of the external surroundings entrepreneurs that are really successful have to do that too because at every level of Entrepreneurship there's more and more noise can you imagine the amount of lawsuits that are ongoing in a billion dollar company it's all day long every day and so most people spend all of their effort trying to fix their surroundings because they think that if they fix and they control everything around them they'll feel a certain way when in my experience it's been the reverse if I can fix how I feel none of these things I label as good or bad anymore and so then I can walk through them through the fire without having to get burned\n"
