  "transcript": "you need to figure out the inputs that you are responsible for that move the needle like I can't hit this hard enough the big secret sauce is that we spend a lot of time trying to make things simple if I hop on a meeting and I'm like what is this for people are just talking and just making noises with their face at one another and they all they just nod because they're used to doing that like yeah it's a great idea what are we going to do and why is what we're going to do going to change anything if it's not going to change anything we should not have this meeting anymore and so just a ruthless focus on what are the inputs what do you do that can double your business and if you don't know your ignorance is the constraint once you do know then your act or execution is the constraint that's it and so it's like man I need to make better content cool then that's what it is so make better content that's the constraint if it's Outreach then cool I need to double my attempts it's just looking at the pipeline and saying what of the inputs I control can I double do that\n"
