  "transcript": "if you want to make more profit than 99% of businesses you need to nail pricing optimizing pricing has a six times stronger increase on profitability than getting more customers and two times stronger increase of profitability than decreasing churn or getting people to buy more times and it is the strongest way for businesses to make more money and so in this video I will walk you through on each page that I turn A New Concept that you can apply to your business that will make it more profitable via price if you don't know who I am my name is Alex rosi I own acquisition. it's a portfol of company over $200 million a year and these videos are to help you show what we do to grow our portfolio so that you can make lots of money and then maybe someday we can invest in your company otherwise enjoy I take a weekly call with a school uh communities in the school group and uh I had like three or four guys who asked me questions that I was like these are not like Alex questions these are math questions that you can just simply solve by doing math and so it's like should I do this price or this price price it's like well what's the conversion of this one versus this one and then what's LTV on this one right it's just you just solve the math problem and I think a lot of businesses are not using math to solve their problems and with pricing being one of the largest levers for making money not one of it is the largest compared to getting more customers uh increasing uh how many times people buy and uh and pricing pricing is still a three times stronger lever on profit versus the other two so let's talk about five concepts of pricing that will make you more money all right so the first one is something that I like to call the price Dev value discrepancy all right and so if we imagine here as the value this little first Red Line This is the value that the person gets this is our price assuming that our price doesn't change over time now if our price doesn't change and the value does when will people cancel here when the price and the value were matched or when it's underneath and this is our sad face as business owners because we're like oh my God I thought that I was making all this money and so the thing is is that there's a third line here that is probably worth understanding and this is our cost line so ideally you want your cost to be here your price to be here so this is your profit and then over here this is your something called customer Surplus uh which is just a fancy word of saying Goodwill or the value that people are getting net of the price right so ideally you have really high value you've got a price that's still high relative to your cost basis as a business owner and so this is the fundamentals of pricing individual now one of the things that I see as a mistake is how does this occur how do we go from having lots of value to not having lots of value well let me explain so with onetime value versus consumable value which is I like to think about it all right so the reason that you have those big discrepancies is that usually you don't don't understand the value that you are delivering to a customer meaning if I say hey let me give you this course on you know building websites whatever right then as soon as you learn how to build websites the value of that course drops to zero you already have the skill like the day before you needed to learn how to do arithmetic arithmetic is super valuable the day after you learn it it has zero additional value now that doesn't ract from what the initial value was it just no longer has value and so what most business owners should do but don't do so this is me telling you that you might want to think about this is differentiating the value that you have in your business between one time and consumable or recurring value all right so let me explain so let's say I uh let's let's let's use that example the websites so my little my little course right on website building is something that would be one one time value once you have it that's it there's there's nothing else but what are all the things that I might have in my business for website building that someone is going to consume this month and next month and the month after I might have a community that's associated of people who are trying to build Pages that's something that I'll use this month and next month I might have accountability if I have somebody who's going to help me build it right accountability SL support that's something that I'll use this month and next month right I'll have access to those things what else would I use probably website servers to host my site right I'd probably use software to host my site I'd probably what else would I use um I might want ads help right that I would use on a monthly basis to help optimize my ads right and so the big thing here is that we have to look at the services we provide and this is especially true with education people because they have lots of one time value and very low recurring value is thinking am I pricing these things appropriately so hear me out I think that a superior pricing model better matches the price to Value discrepancy that you're shooting for on a regular basis so it would make sense for me to charge more here right my price to be higher here and then it would make sense for my price to be lower over here so I continue to have this Delta all the way through right and so the question is how do you accomplish something like that well what you do is you have something called a startup or a one-time fee which is associated with the thing that has onetime value and then you have a lower consumable or recurring billing thing that's associated with the consumable recurring value and this is fundamentally why I think there's so much churn in the media or education or information space is because people don't differentiate between those things but your customers sure do and so the customer says well you want me to pay $1,000 a month for this course but I already learned how to do this and you want me to keep paying for it for 12 months even though I already went through it now you might make the argument well it's worth $122,000 but you know what as far as they're concerned today it's worth nothing and so this is why I like having this this perception of I have a one-time payment up front that's higher and then I have a smaller payment that is done every month that reflects a price to Value discrepancy on these recurring consumable things now one of the things that people have a hard time with is realizing that this is significantly less valuable than this and so what happens is is that this might have to be $5,000 and this might be $300 per month or $200 per month and that's okay and so making sure that that price Dev value discrepancy matches will allow you to have really long LTV on the side and so in so doing get way more LTV overall because people don't leave and if people don't leave they keep paying if they keep paying you keep making money okay now that is the onetime value versus consumable valuable uh concept this is the big head long tail which I talk about in my offers book um in more depth and I think a lot of businesses are going to start switching to it they already are the way that this is done in the infos space is people sell a course and then they have continuity or community on the back end um and you sell it as one thing but the they're just priced differently so you pay $5,000 today but then you pay x per month over time okay now if you were to switch to something like this let me walk you through something that blew my mind that might blow yours as well so profit well did a really cool study on this which showed the difference between monthly billing quarterly billing and annual billing now you're like okay well what's the point who cares well you should care let me show you why so if you build monthly the average turn across all memberships is about 10.7% per month that means if you have 100 people you're going to have 89 at the end of the next month all right if you Bill quarterly that churn drops to 5% okay less than half literally simply by changing the billing Cadence now what happens if you Bill annually it drops all the way to 2% now you're like okay that doesn't seem like a very big difference but let me show you how big of a difference this really is so we can determine LTV by taking price and by the way you all wanted more real business [Â __Â ] this is real business [Â __Â ] okay so you take price and you divide by churn and this gives you your back of napkin LTV all right meaning lifetime value how much Somebody's Worth over time and so that means that if my price is $100 all right $100 and we'll use that for all three of these examples per month right now if it's $100 per month here I'm billing monthly here I'm billing $300 every quarter here I'm billing uh $1,200 per year all right just to be clear now these turn rates R are extrapolated back out to monthly so if I have 10.7% churn 10.7 then it means that my LTV is somewhere in the near but of like 950 bucks somewhere in there okay now if I have 5% churn my LTV is now $2,000 if I have 2% churn my LTV is $5,000 wow so we went from 950 to 5,000 just by changing the Cadence that we built if you're listening to this and you're like wait a second if I made five times the money per customer guess what that would do to my business you bet it would 5x your business then you're like okay well I'm going to do this tomorrow not so fast there you know fast Fred let's talk about the other side of this two things real quick one if you like this stuff uh the question that I was citing at the very beginning of this was from a school uh Q&A that I do so if you're getting into business you want to start a business you can join the school games3 % of people make their first dollar online very proud of that um if they finish the first month of the school game so pretty cool there if you already are a business owner and you like this more in-depth stuff in terms of like scaling the companies uh and increasing profit and eida uh we have workshops that we just started uh offering at acquisition. comom at our headquarters in Vegas um and so if you want to see if you qualify for one of those uh you can go to acquisition. comom hit scale and uh hopefully we'll talk to you then conversion rates and so think about it like this let's say you get 100 clicks or at bats or whatever to pitch this thing right now before this you used to say hey my thing is $122,000 and you Bill you know a th000 bucks a month for a year okay fine now the thing is is maybe you close 20% of people on this okay fine now let's say you have another 100 where you get on the phone and you say for these guys it's $5,000 per year and it's up front now the question is what percent maybe you still sell 20% I don't know this is a testable proposition but this is where it gets really interesting is that for everybody who knows that you you say hey this is $112,000 it's 1,000 a month for 12 months we all know that this person cancels at month four you know what I'm saying so they cancel it month four or five which means the people are worth $4 to $5,000 right now if you Bill $5,000 and you Bill it annually and you say Hey you have to pay this upfront maybe you have the same Clos rate because the price point is so much the perception of the price is so much lower but here's where this gets really interesting is that if we look at this 12 months later and we say hey what percentage of these people are going to renew guess what the percentage is way higher and that brings me to my next point which I will reiterate back on this one which is let's think about what the mechanism is that drives down this churn going from monthly to quarterly to annual so let me tell you what it is or at least my best thought of it is that churn churn is directly correlated with frequency of billing okay so hear me out if I bill you every day the likelihood that you turn is going to be significantly higher than if I bill you every month and I believe that that comes down to what I consider the look back window so think about it like this if I have a month right or a period between billing one and billing two doesn't really matter what this period of time is on this point I'm going to look back with my eyeballs and say how much value did I get between this billing and this billing now if I'm billing monthly then let's say I'm an SEO agency and I make someone 10x their money on month one great month two happens let's say I make them 1X guess what they're going to do they're not going to think oh well he I 10x my money on month one this guy's already paid for himself for almost the whole year no they're going to think well I got a good return last month and I got a crap return this month and so I'm going to cancel it's about what have you done for me lately it's about what have you done in the lookback window between billing Cycles the reason that this frequency piece that I was mentioning earlier is so important is it extends the look back period and so if I paid $5,000 a year to be a part of an association and then it comes up to Bill a year later that I might think to myself huh I look back over a year and say did I make more than $5,000 now that 10x month is going to be including uded and the 1X month and the next month that was a 3X and the next month that's a 1x the next month that's a 15x all of those months are going to be included and I'm going to be like wow this is a banging deal right and so for that reason extending the look back window gives you a higher likelihood that people are going to renew and we already see that it's five times more likely that people Renew on an annual basis now you can make also the argument someone who can pay a fee up front can also afford to do it so they're not just scrimping by to try and barely afford whatever the services and so there's probably a number of reasons that annual does better than monthly or quarterly but for me as a consumer I think to myself I think about what's this look back window and I want it to be as long as humanely possible for someone to logically say this makes sense for me okay so from there I have made a number of conclusions for myself that I'd like for you to consider oops that you can consider for your business all right which is the difference this is kind of counter internet marketing culture which is originally you want to say you want to sell it for as much as you possibly can which I used to preach and I don't believe that as much anymore and I actually would much rather pitch something that I know they're going to continue to pay for right and so I spent the first part of my career trying to obsess about what gets people to stick how do I get people to pay again and again and again and where I have switched to in my career is I just look for things that people already don't cancel from and then I just try and sell those and so if I could do it all over again I would only focus exclusively on things that people already don't cancel so if you look at alarm systems and insurance and payment processing and Banking and other things like that you're going to find things that people in general don't cancel or switch from cable right like people don't switch from these things uh cell phone service like these are things that people don't really switch of very often on the flip side gym memberships are something that people cancel all the time and that's a structural thing people don't want to work out but people do need insurance people do need to watch television people do need to use their phones even more and so I would take all of my emphasis and say why don't I just get into the right boat that I already know has really long LTV um and so that's something that I've just learned in time now now the other piece is I would strongly emphasize the point that I was making earlier about looking at quarter annual and monthly is that I would rather take less money on an annual billing and converted the same percentage so it's like if it's 12K for a year versus 5K paid up front for a year I'd rather have the five because I know that my annual my renewal rate will be much higher so let's let's finish out this uh this little this little equation here so here if this $5,000 is what I'm asking for someone to pay for a year and we have this look back a year later believe it or not remember we have 2% a lot of times this means you're going to keep 80 0% or more of the customers and so all of a sudden wait a second remember we had 2% monthly churn but this is a 5K thing well that means that this price point would be 5,000 / 12 can youone do that math for me that's 600 bucks a month 500 600 bucks a month 500 bucks a month 465 46 416 okay so 416 all right and then we multiplied this guy by 50 because it's 2% churn right which means they have uh what is that that's going to be 20,000 something all right don't worry it's 2% churn there we go so this is 2% which is equal this times 50 same thing equals uh 20,800 all right the reason this is so important the reason this is so important is that look at the difference between this 20,000 and this 4 or 5,000 that we have here now this means that a year from now you're going to have 80 out of the 100 people still paying you and then they renew again and guess what if you keep selling at this rate that means that you get all of last year's sales to stack on top of this year's sales and guess what happens in the third year you have last year's the year before and this year's that stack on top of each other and so this is what creates a compounding business and the vast majority vast vast majority of small businesses do not understand this and the reason that they stay poor is because they think that the only way that they can grow their business is to increase the number of customers that they're selling every month and that simply is a very terrible way to live because the moment your acquisition Channel your your YouTube channel gets shut down your Facebook ad account gets shut down you've got some sort of deliver deliverability issue on your domains if you're doing Outreach right there's always something that can happen and unless you have customers that plan on continuing to pay you over and over again it means your business dies immediately that's not a very valuable business it's also one that's hard to sleep with at night and so the idea is you want to find stuff that people don't stop buying you want to sell the crap out of it you want to sell it at a price point that you know they're going to continue to pay you want to extend the look back window as much as you possibly can so it increases the likelihood that they're going to convert and you also have a bidirectional relationship between the price and the conversion rate and so maybe you do get more people to buy at $11,000 down than you do at 5 grand upfront but on the flip side $5,000 is less than $12,000 for the year and so you're going to have two forces that are going to be working against each other now for me personally I would rather have the much higher quality customer that's going to be in the most optimized billing cycle and if I do think about this with my thinking hat maybe I either do the big head long tail which is if I know my thing isn't tremendously valuable then I might say my one time upfront that offsets my cost to acquire customers and then I have a very small monthly billing after that that has a big price to Value discrepancy on based on the consumable value of my service or thing or I know that my value is high and it is high on a recurring basis but it's volatile meaning some months it's big some months it's not big this is particularly true of things like ads or organic like if you have something that goes you know viral one month that's going to make a lot of money for them if it doesn't go viral the next month and it doesn't now some of these things you can't control and so by having an extended look back window it increases the likely that something good happens during that time period it increases like that they will build again in the future and so the tldr for you number one one separate out one time versus consumable value and then if you can do that you can switch to the big head longtail pricing model which is one time up front and then small recurring the alternative is that you can consider increasing the look back window right between when people see value and when they get value there's our little eyeball looking back money and so what we can do is trying to switch to annual to the best degree possible and billing based on what you think someone is going to continue to pay for what they're going to pay for on their worst month rather than what you can as much as you can get them to say yes to today and this is something that I've switched to over time the third thing is making sure that you're in the right boat and when I say that what I mean is instead of trying to obsess about getting people to buy more times go to stuff that people already don't cancel and you'll be amazed at how much easier it is to do business and how those things stack on top of one another by the way if you're wondering why my eyes look back and forth between things it's cuz I have three things I'm looking at one is I have a bunch of notes cuz I do prepare these for you guys cuz I don't want to just like be off the cuff and just rambling uh second is that I do these uh with Instagram lives and so those are on a separate camera than the YouTube camera and I try to look at the YouTube camera but I also have a hard time not looking at the audience that's onagram live and so if you see my eyes darting back and forth that's why so now we'll transition to questions from the audience the question is one is how do I know how to raise my price because of things like inflation and how do I just raise my price in general if I've been in business for a period of time all right so those are two separate questions I'll answer each to them individually so from an inflation perspective uh every continuity contract I would include a clause that says that you can match the CPI or the you know consumer price index that allows you to map up uh the price with inflation that's up to you now having that Clause doesn't mean necessarily mean that you have to always do it every month or every year but it means every two or three years you can just update your pricing accordingly people don't like pricing changes and so uh I would do it less frequently rather than more frequently uh so that's number one in terms of inflation in terms of thinking about one to raise prices in general uh I encourage everyone to continue to raise prices until your conversion rate times price equal less money meaning if I can sell now again this doesn't take into effect uh into account uh hard costs all right so I'm just going to assume that the cost of our thing is zero let's say it's a it's a digital media thing just for sake of simplicity so if I can sell if I get on the phone with with 100 people and I can sell 10 people at $10,000 uh I have a you know 10% conversion rate which means I make $100,000 from $100 from 100 calls that's 1,000 bucks a call now if I can all of a sudden get to 30% uh close rate with a $5,000 thing then it means that I make $150,000 on those 100 calls and so then I would make 1,500 bucks per call and so I try and level out the uh cost per or Revenue per uh phone call or conversation so that I can understand What's the total amount of money that I'm making so it's not necessarily about raising prices or lowering prices it's about what is the total absolute amount of gross profit you can maximize and so this is a math problem not a Alex what should I price it at problem and I will tell you exactly what we do with every company which is we just [Â __Â ] test the price and so we get on the phone and we say and I will say this it's way easier to go low to high than high to low all right and so if you if you sell at a price that's more expensive over time that works out okay if you if you go the other direction it can kind of suck and so um I think going up because think about it you're like yeah well that's what I was selling at last month we have more demand now we're better at our stuff like it makes sense like if you bought a Apple stock at 10 and now it's 20 like you're not going to be upset like in time prices change now the flip side is when prices come down uh if you if you are in that position then the reason behind it would be useful to tell the other people but usually you're going to have to downgrade those people if they're still in your business uh because if you did figure out some technological thing which would be probably your big reason why if like hey we figured out how to make this more efficient so we can lower the price we pass the savings on to you uh then you have to pass the savings on to them uh otherwise if you sold someone last month at 20K and this month at 10K very tough if it's for the same thing uh and so that's why I like starting low and then raising it and then usually at the very end I'm going to have to do tiny little adjustment of like okay I I realized I went over the hump of maximizing my profit and so then I back step and then I refund these people the difference where I give them a bonus in practice most businesses will have a monthly and an either or quarterly or annual it's usually not one or the other and you'll probably know your avatar uh if if if if prepaying 12 months at a time is too uh arduous for them uh then it might it might be better to just have quarterly billing um as the primary way and I would say that as I'm as I'm explaining this right now you might be able to just get away with pure quarterly B billing and not have monthly or annual like you just do quarterly um and that might be a kind of a nice blend for a lot of people as like the Middle Ground um but it's very typical to have monthly at this rate annual at 16% less because it's uh you know buy 10 get two free um and by doing that though if you get people onto that annual remember you're giving them a 16% discount but the likel that those people recur and the LTV on those people still might be 10 time uh five times higher than these people so you take a 5x increase in LTV and then apply the 16% discount to the fact it's a lower price and then you'll get probably something closer to a you know 4 and 1/2x so it's still worth having that quote discount for the annual rate if you want to incentivize people to go to the annual first off you have the discount so that's you know thing one um and I like to associate as many benefits assumably possible immediately for making the decision and so I want bad things I take away so discounts would be a pricing thing that I a bad thing I take away and then I also want to add good things so it's like um if I had a call it a call it a customer appreciation thing or I had uh I had specific times or sessions that only VIP customers so basically consider it like you even name it something so it's like you have your standard and your VIP even if it's the same pricing you'll get way more people to take it because they want the status Associated and then VIP get these other three benefits it's like they don't have to wait in line they can get the session times they want or we have a special Saturday session or Sunday session that's only for VIP and they get you know Tow Service whatever you just think about anything that's VIP two or three things that ideally give them status in the community for for being a VIP which you have now associated with the annual billing which has the highest stick rate so not only you providing more value to these people they pay a little bit less and they get the status and that's okay because they pay four and a half times more over Lifetime and so this is how you stack as much as you can in the annual uh so that you can just make a lot more money and the other really big benefit that I didn't hit on at all in the video that I should have is that annual if you do increase the conversion percentage there in in a real way you're frontloading a year of Revenue meaning your ability to offset the cost to acquire Customer skyrockets because you get so much more cash collected up front so you can get really aggressive in the acquisition even if you have a small like let's say you convert half as many into the annual billing it's like okay well I get half as many but I get 10 times The Upfront cash so I still get 5x upfront cash as I did before into monthly and so if that's the case then I'm still crushing it the question is is it better to Bill upfront versus bill monthly and get the contract because then with that in theory the contract plus the lower rate would convert a higher percentage people and it would extend the LTV so I'm going to give a two-part answer to this number one is the contract that you lock someone in on is only worth the quality of the signature on the contract meaning the person or the prospect who buys it is their creditworthiness that matters now for example in Europe uh contracts matter a lot more and people actually adhere to them like it's there's not a really big you know churn rate on people saying that they don't make they don't with their commitments in the US it's just a different culture in terms of how credit and contracts work like people get out of and cancel contracts or ghost or cancel their credit cards all the time and this is because visa and MasterCard and those companies have become a very Pro consumer uh basically uh cover for people to not stick with their commitments because they will always side with the consumer on chargebacks and refunds and so it allows people to make purchases without consequences and so I like the people where contracts matter is like Enterprise customers if you have a massive company that you're doing business with contracts matter if you're dealing with like consumers contracts don't mean anything and if you look at the biggest companies that deal with consumers the vast majority of them don't even bother doing contracts because what ends up happening is that PE it let me say it this way it will decrease sales to such a larger extent that just billing month-to month and then focusing on improving the quality of the thing you have because at the end of the day if the contract doesn't matter either way all the does is decrease sales because people Factor it in to their purchase but they don't Factor it into their cancellation and so it's like you increase friction on the front end but you don't decrease friction on the back end now in general will someone who signs a contract stay longer than someone who is month-to month yes but the question is what's the trade-off on conversion and is it worth it versus taking all that effort and putting it into how do I improve the the quality of the prospect uh product um how do I in improve the quality of the prospect as well in terms of targeting and messaging but the big one is is there a way that I can just pick something that people already don't cancel the question was is there a way to extend the lookback period beyond the billing cycle meaning can you accumulate saving you know time saving if you had a software or money made if you had an agency or anything to that degree or you know pounds lost if you did weight loss whatever you know marriage is saved you know fights avoided if you're in marriage counseling whatever um I think that the the the the best thought process that I would have around this is yes I would try and report that data on a cumulative basis as much as humanly possible because then it allows me to at least try try and price or at least display my value relative to price on a longer time rizon like hey uh you know we have brought you 35,000 you know clicks to your website over the last 6 months now it doesn't like it might look like this in terms of the volatility it might be up and down but if you look back cumulatively relative to what you paid it's still you know a great deal and so I think that is where customer success and having some you know Tech and how you're reporting and how you have those conversation with the customer is super important in terms of framing so I think there are huge benefits to trying to show the cumulative uh increase but just being really real most people don't care that much so I think it might lift you a few points but the big big is they're still going to think well you know you build me last month and this month I only got one X and it's not worth it for example if you look at instacart they say we saved you this many hours of going shopping and driving or whatever and so it is over the duration of the time that you've had instacart they will show you what your savings are not what I saved you this month hey if you like this more mathematical approach to business by the way this is how I actually do business that's not the YouTube version and the reason that these videos will always get fewer views is because it's actually for business owners uh that being said one of my favorite videos that I've ever made uh is seven equations that will make you money uh it is fours business owners that want to make money you have to know these equations I do them in every business that I invest in like watch it memorize like you should know these like they you should know them like the back of your hand you shouldn't just like memorize them like you should understand them uh because that's how you will ultimately make a lot more money in your business by looking at it like an investor and investing accordingly\n"
