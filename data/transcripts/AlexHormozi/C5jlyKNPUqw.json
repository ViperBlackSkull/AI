  "transcript": "entrepreneurship is a continuous story of growth people who are not in this world call it change which is why when you go home they say hey you know what you've changed and they say like it's an insult but the only thing you say back to that is you haven't because what they're saying is I want you to stay the same if you're watching my channel then my hope is that you don't want that you want to be better tomorrow than you were today and if you're better tomorrow that means you're different tomorrow if you're different tomorrow it means you changed and if you're anything like me not changing for the rest of your life sounds like the ultimate hell\n"
