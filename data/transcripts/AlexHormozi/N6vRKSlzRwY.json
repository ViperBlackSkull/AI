  "transcript": "54 of Americans read below a 7th grade reading level which means that if you're trying to get people to do stuff you have to massively simplify it Pascal said I'm sorry my letter is so long if I had more time I would have made it shorter and it's because it takes more effort to make things simple the amount of effort that it takes to distill good stuff down is what makes it valuable don't think you're dumbing it down think that you are packaging it in a way that will communicate to more people and if you're a silly goose who says well I don't want to attract any of these dumb people realize that very smart people also recognize somebody who intelligently can distill something down into simple form so if you want your thing to reach as many people as possible make it as simple as possible\n"
