  "transcript": "when I was in high school I went to a commercial gym big dude was curling 40s I went up to him and I started calling him and the guy just smiled because he knew what I didn't know which was it's not about the weight on the bar the weight of the muscle now almost 20 years later I curl almost the same weight I did that it's just the weight on my muscle is 10 times more differentiate between Lifting for ego or Lifting for muscle it's just like an effort to humility because when you do that though if you build it back up the right way and then you blow it pass but everyone just gets stuck in the short term like I want to see the weight on the bar go off I want to see my Revenue go up but not the quality of my business or my product\n"
