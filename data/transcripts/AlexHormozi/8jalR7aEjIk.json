  "transcript": "one of the things that had happened in the five generations of fur coat fathers passing on to fur coat Sons they realized that in the summer they never had any demand cuz people aren't trying to buy fur coats in the summer and they're like huh what can we sell to people that's still on brand for fur coats during the summer and so they came up with a genius idea we'll store and condition the coats for them as they sold every single customer a coat they said hey every year make sure during the summer when you're not using the coat you bring it back here we can repair any damages we can sew things up we can condition the fur and we can make it last two three five times long and then he would give this a little analogy he's like right if you're going to buy a $50,000 car you'd pay 100 bucks a month for insurance to insure the car of course right it's the same thing here overnight he created what I would consider an insurance product if you do anything guaranteeing your work either through Labor or just decreasing the risk that it happens you can charge people for the safety that whatever they just bought will continue to provide value for a longer period of time\n"
