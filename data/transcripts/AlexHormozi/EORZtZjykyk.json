  "transcript": "in Vietnam a massive percentage of people tried heroin the U.S government thought they were going to have this epidemic of heroin addicted soldiers when they got back but that's not what happened why when people get on heroin in the U.S and then they go to a rehab center nine out of ten of them relapsed back into taking heroin so what is the difference it's because the environment changed if you are a heroin addict in this environment and then you change your environment to a rehab center then all of a sudden you're not a heroin addict in that environment you don't have the cues you don't have the access you don't have the resources Etc and then you go back into the place you have the same access the same resources Etc then it cues the same behaviors now the soldiers had environments but they were one-time environments and when they came back to the US they lost all of those cues and all those rewards associated with why they were doing her to begin with because they changed their environment they changed their behavior\n"
