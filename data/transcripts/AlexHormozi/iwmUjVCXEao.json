  "transcript": "the closer people are to you when you're at your bottom the more they'll work for you at the bottom but as you pass them in whatever material thing you're you know Pursuit is you remind them of the dreams that they gave up on you go from being the person who reminds them that they could go after their dreams to reminding them that they never went after them to begin with and then what happens you go through this period where no one from your hometown or who who knew you in the beginning approves and then what happens is absolute strangers from the internet who never saw the beginning become a bigger fan of you because they can relate to the story but because you weren't there next door neighbor they don't feel blame for them not having achieved whatever yet because if everyone in your friend group when you're coming up they see that they have the exact same access to resources opportunities that you do and then for some reason they haven't done something so it's painful because I think there's some Sting of inadequacy that they probably self judge as a result\n"
