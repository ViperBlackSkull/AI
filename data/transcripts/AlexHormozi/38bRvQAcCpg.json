  "transcript": "I judge myself so much on not being happy all the time because I thought there was something wrong with the fact that I wasn't happy that I drove myself insane not being happy rather than just being like you know what maybe I'm just going to do the stuff and just [Â __Â ] happiness for a minute it's like an appreciation of The Human Experience even in the suffering there's Beauty in that because it's purely human I think it's just understanding both sides of the coin like if there's few things that I believe it is that right now there are things in my life that I don't like that I wish for better and there are things in my life that I really liked 10 years ago it was the same way and 10 years from now it'll be the same way and when I die there will be stuff that I will not have accomplished that I will wish I had there will be things that I wish I had done better that I will not have done and there will be things that I have done that I am proud of those things are not going to change and so all I can do is just enjoy the game and it took me a really long time to get there or at least it felt like I suffered a lot on that process and so I think it's like when we have these am I happy am I not happy you have to rise above it so that you can just feel the Spectrum which is just being present if I can just be present even in my suffering then I can experience joy for being human and having this experience that I only get once\n"
