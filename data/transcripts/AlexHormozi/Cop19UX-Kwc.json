  "transcript": "if you're working hard to achieve your goals and your work isn't being recognized I would ask you why do you need your work to be recognized do you need other people to validate your goals because that's what it sounds like it means that you're building it for them rather than building it for you and if you're building it for them then you're always going to be disatisfied because they're never going to care as much about it as you will they're never going to give you as much credit as you want you have to change why you're building it\n"
