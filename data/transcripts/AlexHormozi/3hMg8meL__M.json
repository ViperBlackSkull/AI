  "transcript": "this is one of my favorite overcomes when someone says it's not about the money when they don't want to buy a product or service i say totally understand so if it were completely free would you do it most times they're like well i mean if it were free i would do it and then you say cool then it's not not about the money and so then you confront the money as though they tried to cast it aside then you can confront the real issue so you can solve the deal\n"
