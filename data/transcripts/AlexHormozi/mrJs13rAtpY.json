  "transcript": "I was taking home about twenty thousand dollars a month for my gym and I was still sleeping on the floor and here's why I actually am very security driven I wanted to make sure that I had a nest egg which I had pretty much blown in order to start this business and so every month all I wanted to do is make sure that I covered the rent of the business and then I had no employees at the time for the first few months and so I did everything in the business so everything above the rent was mine to keep and so every month as it went up my profit went up but I just filed that all into savings because I was so worried about something potentially happening and ultimately I think it was the right call because I was able to make bigger decisions later because of the savings I was able to have by not getting a place and spending stuff on Furnishing and all that kind of jazz\n"
