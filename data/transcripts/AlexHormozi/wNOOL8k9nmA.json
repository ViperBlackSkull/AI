  "transcript": "why your life partner is so important to your ultimate success I think a lot of people compromise on their partners because they're convenient for me not only wanted to encourage the dreams but like participate our entire first few months of dating was just I'm gonna work all day you can work next to me I think because we had such low expectations getting into the relationship it made candid conversations much easier there's so many ways to have marriages this is what worked for me and I am weird and so my marriage is atypical I like working all the time and I wanted someone who would work all the time with me because if I didn't then I wouldn't see them and eventually we were looking at each other be like oh we don't know each other\n"
