  "transcript": "so I've been consistently just always trying to optimize off function and so like these shirts are super comfortable if it gets cold I can button up and I can roll the sleeves down yeah if it gets a little warmer I can roll the sleeves up and keep it buttoned if I can open it and keep the sleeves rolled or I can keep it open and roll the sleeves out so I have four different temperature settings and I can take it off and with this I have beater and I've got like basically Hawaiian shirts and I've got flannels so it's like when it's summer I'll switch to Hawaiians and it's winter and I'll have flannels and I just have Peter as the base I literally have all of the colors of the shirt now\n"
