  "transcript": "there's this moment in The Matrix when morphy is explaining how fast Neo is going to be and he's saying what are you trying to tell me that I'm going to be able to dodge bullets and morphe says no when you're ready you won't have to I spend all my time teaching people how to dodge bullets how to sell without a brand how to sell without Authority how to sell from day one how to make money when you have nothing because I've done it and a lot of times that's where you have to start and so that's why that's all the stuff that I teach when you can build a brand and have the patience to do it which is deliberately creating associations between things people know things people don't know which is going to be your business and ideally those associations being positive for that audience that eventually you can take away the thing and they have the positive association with your brand without needing the thing if you can succeed at doing that Apple just says we have a new product buy it\n"
