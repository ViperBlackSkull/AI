  "transcript": "buddy mine has a daughter she was working at a bowling alley minimum wage job he told her he's like you know you can triple your income if you just get a certification to become a photus it takes 2 days it's 500 bucks by taking $500 she could invest in the S&P 500 and at 18 years old maybe there' be a ton of compounding but if she invests $500 in getting the certification and then 2 days later she triples her income probably a better investment in buying the certification than forever having a three times higher Baseline for what she can make\n"
