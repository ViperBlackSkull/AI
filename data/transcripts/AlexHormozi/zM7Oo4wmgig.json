  "transcript": "fear is a mile wide and an inch deep and so it looks like this ocean that you're going to step into and drown but as soon as you step into it you realize it was not that deep at all and you can keep walking through it a lot of times when it's like we have this anxiety around this big decision we have to make if you actually take the step and realize that it's not death you're not going to drown immediately there's plenty of other steps you can take from there even if you get a little wet\n"
