  "transcript": "when you're busy is when you should do it that's when you should start so when someone says like I don't want to work out because I'm busy right now it's like then that means that you assume that in order for you to work out in the future you're going to have to not be busy so do you think you'll never be busy for the rest of your life no do you want to work out for the rest of your life yes so you should start when you're busy because that way when you're not busy you'll be fine but when it gets busy again you'll also be fine otherwise assumes that you won't which means if you wait so you're not busy to start as soon as you're busy again you'll stop which is what you've done every single time before this\n"
