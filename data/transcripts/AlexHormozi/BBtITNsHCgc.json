  "transcript": "first rule of poverty is to wait for perfect conditions because if you wait for perfect conditions it assumes that those are required to be successful when they are no longer perfect you admit that you will stop or fail again and so the best time to start is when it is hard when things are imperfect because they will be imperfect again in the future and if you can succeed when you are most motivated in the beginning because it's new and exciting through the imperfect conditions when those imperfect conditions happen again you will already have track record of having gone through it and so you'll know you'll be able to continue and so whether it's weight loss or starting a business start when it's hard and then it will get easy don't start when it's easy\n"
