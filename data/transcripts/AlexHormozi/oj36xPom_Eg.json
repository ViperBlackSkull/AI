  "transcript": "let's say job number one pays you 80,000 a year and you're expected to bring all the game and build everything and no one there knows anything about the skill that you have that you spend a lot of time learning versus job two is $440,000 a year and there's tons of dudes who are way ahead of you in that job which one's the better deal well the answer depends on your time Rising if you only live one more year of your life then you should do the 80 grand but if you think you're going to live longer than a year or two then you should do the 40 Grand increase your earning potential and then later you right hook life and you can maximize or realize the potential you've had over the skills you've stacked\n"
