  "transcript": "we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never think to question why should we process a traumatic event what does that mean so let's just say something bad happens in another culture that might not be bad it's trauma in this culture it's not trauma in this culture so if the circumstance is the same why was it traumatic circumstances weren't the same why not because the culture the facts were the same if it's traumatic in one instance and not traumatic in another then it means that we can basically change the cultural narrative that we're ascribing to our context and make it not traumatic well let's say like the passing of a parent we have a narrative that says if I don't mourn it means I didn't care about them that's a statement of belief why does my mourning have any indication of how much I cared they're non-correlates we have so many of these belief statements that quote Society or things that we inherit but we just choose to say that this is how life is when someone's like I was traumatized it's like were you or do you just choose to label this trauma and then now you've up the rest of your life because you call it trauma when 200 years ago it was life we just choose to create meaning around things\n"
