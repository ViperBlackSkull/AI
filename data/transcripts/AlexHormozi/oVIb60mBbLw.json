  "transcript": "yes I am huge but not as huge as The Rock's net worth here are four things I learned from The Rock number one he's been in this for 27 years and so to compare my brand or someone else's brand to somebody's been doing this for almost three decades hey you look great for your age by the way is crazy don't compare your first year to someone's 30th number two work ethic one of the things he's been known for is he shows up on the set first he's last to leave he never skips his workouts he brings the gym with him because he always wants to put the extra reps in not natural Talent work ethic number three expanding the niche he started as a football player and then he became WWE wrestler and then he got into action films as a low man on the tone Po and then he became able to star in action films and now he's in Disney movies that are broad he has continued to lean into growth and expansion for who he is and what he represents and number four he Tastefully monetized his brand by doing things that people already loved him for they already know that he works out so he has a pre-workout supplement energy drink and they know that he stays out late so the energy drink makes sense he likes apparel so his project rock with Under Armour made sense now if he came out and started selling Lamborghinis it probably wouldn't make sense with his brand and that's why he's the people's champion\n"
