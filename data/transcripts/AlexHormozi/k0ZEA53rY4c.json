  "transcript": "oldest lady to ever lived smoked cigarettes and drank wine until she was 116. if you get anxiety over making everything perfect the stress of being perfect will kill you faster than the things that are imperfect for me I've taken that as a lesson of life sometimes you can just smoke the cigarette if you feel like it you could have the shot of whiskey at the end of the day if you feel like and you can have the donut as long as you don't do it all the time to the point that you're going to kill yourself\n"
