  "transcript": "I get criticized from family still that I quote work too much but that's because like their projection of what work means to them is just so negative and if I said all I do is play video games all day then they would say that I'm not working enough but what if I my job was to play video games all day then I'd be working too much it's just like it's simply just their projections of how they would prefer I live my life and their statement basically is I would prefer you live your life the way I want you to live your life to which I say no\n"
