  "transcript": "here are my two favorite strategies for getting over a breakup number one is that it takes you as long as you decide it takes to get over a breakup a lot of people think that you have to feel heartbreak in order to honor the relationship that you were in like if I immediately start dating right after I got out of this relationship and it means that I didn't value the relationship but why is that true like why can't I have an amazing relationship value it and then start dating somebody the next day it's only a belief it's an assumption the second thing is I think that the easiest way to get over somebody is to find someone better and so it's not saying that they suck it's just saying that you guys might suck together and you can find someone who's better fit for you and so I think you should absolutely just get right back on the horse get back in the hunt and then realize that there are a lot of fish in the sea\n"
