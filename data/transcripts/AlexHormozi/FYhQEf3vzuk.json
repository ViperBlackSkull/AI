  "transcript": "one of the reasons that I don't go home for the holidays is that a lot of people haven't grown since I left they haven't had 10 years of growth they've lived the same six months 20 times and when I go back they want to meet me in my past and so they want to speak things over me that aren't Who I Am anymore and then because it's difficult for them to connect their perception of who I used to be and who the person is sitting in front of them reconciling those two things is really difficult for a lot of people because it's breaking the Box they want to put you in but the reality is that most people don't change entrepreneurs do because we have to we call it growth instead of change\n"
