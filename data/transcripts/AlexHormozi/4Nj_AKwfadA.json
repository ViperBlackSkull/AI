  "transcript": "leaving things to your kids doesn't benefit them for a variety of reasons leaving it to someone in general or giving it to someone in general when someone hasn't earned it tends to alter their behavior in a negative way so how many people have seen like the trust fund kids that just completely lose their minds spend you know all their money and get into drugs because they have no challenge they have no hardships everything has been removed from their lives and then basically the real hardship becomes themselves we benefit from struggle on a character development perspective and I see money as potential energy to be exchanged and so if you give someone who's not prepared for a Gob of potential energy that they did not earn or learn how to wield it will ultimately burn them up\n"
