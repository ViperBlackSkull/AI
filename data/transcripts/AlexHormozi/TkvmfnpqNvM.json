  "transcript": "generational wealth is transferred through education not assets ninety percent of the time by Third Generation The Wealth has been squandered because they never learned how to make the money all they had was they were given the money and it's a lot like if you give a man a fish he eats for a day even if you have lots of fish you still need to teach them how to fish because that generation needs to teach the Next Generation how to fish because the fish do eventually run out and so on that long time Horizon it's education not the asset itself that transfers it over the Long Haul\n"
