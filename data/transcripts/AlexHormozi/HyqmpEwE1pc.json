  "transcript": "here's how I know if my advertising is working I take the total amount of payroll that I spend on whatever Channel I'm advertising on and then I divide that by the total number of leads I got from that advertising channel so for example if it cost me a hundred thousand dollars to have five people work in my content department and I got a thousand leads from my content they would mean it cost me 100 per lead now to figure out if my advertising is profitable I look at my Revenue per lead and if my Revenue per lead in this example is over 300 per lead then I'm getting three to one or more that's how I figure out whether my advertising is working for platforms that aren't just paid media\n"
