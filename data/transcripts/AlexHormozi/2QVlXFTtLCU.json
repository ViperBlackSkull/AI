  "transcript": "I like prefacing things with it's really expensive before I say the price and I like doing that because no matter how rich someone is expensive always means expensive like so it's expensive and it's like they brace themselves and then you say it if they imagine a number higher it's a relief if they imagine a number that's high but we're still higher they were braced for it and so then you don't have these big reactions if someone's like I've never paid more than $1,000 I'm like yeah and you're here today the biggest advantage that we all have and anything they've bought is that they're here they clearly didn't work so like everyone's from everything they've done in the past they have such a disadvantage cuz they reached out to us from like a leverage perspective they want you to sell them they're just like say something else\n"
