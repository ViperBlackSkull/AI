  "transcript": "so why am I here with a child's toy well this child's toy when it was introduced went from 70 million in sales to 350 million in sales in a year it's over 2 billion dollars of equity value from a company because of one thing that they were able to do and what was that thing they figured out that they could demonstrate value ahead of time for a customer and so if we're trying to sell products and services a big thing that we can do to get more people to want to buy is think how can we demonstrate the product in advance and so for example a long time ago people used to buy clothes without trying them on and then one very enterprising business owner was like I will let people try them on the store even though I now have to build changing rooms and I have to risk theft but even despite all those things they were able to make more sales and now it's Common Place figuring out ways that you can allow people to at least experience the concept of it even if it's just by demonstrating another client's results in front of them it makes it much more real and then what happens is it decreases the risk that they're not going to get what they want with the purchase\n"
