  "transcript": "don't ask for anything for two years and you'll probably have a bigger audience than you can possibly deal with but most people don't they can't wait for the ask and if you don't have the value to provide then you need to go get the people that have the value it's shifting from how to to how I so instead of saying like here's how to build or whatever it's like well you don't have the context or The credibility so no one's going to listen like how to eat the best breakfast it's like how I ate my breakfast or the best breakfast that works for me or my favorite breakfast and if you make your content from that way it avoids sounding preachy or arrogant but I think the real thing is that I think you're just afraid to make content and like afraid to wait and realistically the first three quarters of them will blow but you'll start to find a voice to start to find a click and then you'll get better\n"
