  "transcript": "here's one of the ways Amazon manipulates people to buy more things Amazon weaves in reviews and different types of reviews all along their site because they know it boosts sales everybody seems to use them and the reason they do that is because people will do things that they've seen other people do first is just by having it visually displayed number one so people can see it the second is trying to find examples that are just like the Avatar so if you have certain types of customers you want other customers just like them to show their experience and the third way that you can make it more powerful is that you show other people who are just like them who are going through the same circumstance or experience and so if you can show all three of those things it's actually even more powerful than a really amazing testimonial from someone in a different circumstance or a different Walk of Life and so if you put those three things together you'll get way more conversions on your websites your sales advertising and everything you do to promote your products and service\n"
