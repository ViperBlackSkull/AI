  "transcript": "so if you're a perfectionist and you don't know when to stop the line that I draw in the sand is I'm getting very different feedback from everyone because if you get the same feedback from everyone that something is wrong what they saying is wrong is usually correct so it's like if you writing a book or you're editing a film there's going to be a moment where people like I don't know maybe you should do this here maybe you should do that like whatever the recommendations are irrelevant it's just that that part is boring or not right people are good enough to say this isn't good and so I will continue to go until eventually it's all over the map once it's all over the map then it means that then it's just preferences and which case I'm fine and then it has to pass my test of like do I think it's exceptional is there anything else that I can do to make this better if I had another month or another 6 months would I do anything different with this thing\n"
