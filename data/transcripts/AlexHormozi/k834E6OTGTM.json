  "transcript": "so here's my promise to you guys today I can show you how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff and I want to be clear the lead getting strategies I share with you today work for Real Estate medical Auto homeowners insurance Health Care local businesses home services financial services consumer services software apps e-learning online businesses e-commerce and anything that sells stuff to anyone and I know they work because I use them in our portfolio companies today which include software local business e-commerce consumer services medical services Professional Services home services and more so I know this works from experience and not Theory which brings up one of my favorite quotes from LH Hardwick a man with an experience is never at the mercy of a man with an opinion so that being said let's begin 100 million dollar leads how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff so first things first for those of you who do know me I want to address the elephant in the room is Alex going to finally sell us something has anyone else been wondering this because it's been two years and the only thing I've made available for purchase is a Kindle book for a dollar and ninety nine cents so I can't tell you the answer to that yet you'll have to stay and find out but what I can tell you is at the end of the presentation we will be exporting the list of every single person here alive to give you the special project that I've been working on for four years and I can't tell you what it is yet you'll find out in a moment but what I can tell you is it's more than a gift card it's less than a Tesla and every single person here live today will get one for free and you will be the only people who get one and I did it this way so that next time I say be there it'll be worth it anyone not here will believe me because I give them proof that I keep my promises and to the same degree as we dive in I don't expect you to take my word for how good the opportunity I'm about to share with you is I want to prove it to you so let me explain so when I see stuff like this it bothers me right you see books this is how to Market a book and you can look and say you know there's 14 reviews on it so I don't need to read the book to know that the book doesn't contain contents that know how to Market a book because I have evidence in the real world that the concepts the book are not effective I don't need to read it I already know it isn't good and it's kind of like a dentist with bad teeth or somebody claiming they can help you grow your social media flying with less than 100 followers right you should walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk in fact I'd argue that the walk is the only talk that matters and so a lot of what I do is somewhat meta meaning I'm trying to both Show and Tell at the same time so for example my first book 100 million dollar offers answered the question what do I sell answer so good an offer is so good people feel stupid saying no it demonstrated the concept it outlined creating a grand slam offer it was high value it included a free course with no opt-in which today is over a million views which was high value with a low price relative to what it delivered and a high price to Value discrepancy 100 million offers is itself a grand slam offer using the value equation as its guiding star and two years later it's still number one in every category it's listed with over fifteen thousand five stars it helps unless you go from 50 45 000 a month to 170 000 a month it helps until you go from ten thousand a month to forty five thousand a month to help Scott 10x his business from 50 to 100 a month to 53 000 a month and Tanner get his first business started and get to five thousand a month from zero as a kid in his twenties and if you want the bigger numbers it helps Antoine go from 50 000 a month to 750 000 a month and the zillions of other real stories who use the stuff in 100 million dollar offers to start or grow their businesses so I can feel confident saying its success became its own proof its content works and so after releasing that book in July of 2021 I wanted to use the next 24 months leading up to this event as one thing proof proof that the stuff that I show in 100 million dollar leads actually works to get leads today in the real world and it'll work for you too because I wasn't born with a five million person audience this is only 24 months ago on YouTube and this is today and this was 24 months ago on my podcast a completely different platform and this is today and I did this spending only two days per month dedicated to advertising with the rest of my time running our portfolio in fact during this time within the first 24 months our portfolio companies on average 2.8 x revenue and 4.7 next profit meaning you can still do the stuff that grows your company without spending all your time getting leads you just need to do it better and I wanted to use this event as my own evidence for the book I used all eight methods which I'll explain shortly to advertise the book I did it with the sole purpose to show that they work to advertise anything to any one period so I used all the methods in the book to advertise the book itself because if you know what you're doing you don't need a lot of time you just need to do the right stuff the right way but knowing what to do is the hardest part again which is why we've dedicated our huge resources to this mission to make real business education accessible for everyone and I'm going to do my darnest to live up to that idea for you guys today that is my promise so I'm going to deliver to two types of people today type one for people who need to put their oxygen mask on and take care of themselves and their family I promise you I will help you get closer to that today for free period so you're going to want to stay until the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time and I'm saying until my absolute Last Breath believe me when I say it we're going to be on a on a twisty and Tourney Road today it'll be fun and for group two for those of you who are in a position to help me pay it forward I'm going to show you how it's in your self-interest to help me help everyone else and if you decide to join me I'll show you how we can accomplish both our missions together because at the end of the day no one's going to save you life is not a bedtime story The Cavalry isn't coming you're it so you've got to learn this stuff period so now that we got that out of the way let's get some leads so let's Zoom all the way out who here would like to start or grow their business bigger than it currently is let me know in the chat great otherwise this would have been a very short presentation so rather than talk about all the ways that we could grow it I want to take the reverse approach how could you guarantee that you'd shrink or never grow to begin with answer tell no one about your stuff and if no one knows about your stuff we can be pretty sure they aren't going to buy it we laugh but some of you are doing this right now so let's assume that you already have something to sell amazing valuable thing if more people find out about it do you make more money yes so here's a writer Downer all else being equal when you double your leads you double your business sometimes it really is that simple there's a reason these companies hit billions almost overnight they had already advertised enough to build that size company they just needed to make an offer and that's great for them but what if you're in the reverse situation you have an offer and no one to give it to then you need to let them know about your stuff in other words you need to advertise bottom line advertising is important because if no one knows about your stuff no one buys it but there's another huge reason getting leads is so important for entrepreneurs if you always know how to get more leads it gives you endless chances to get it right and as much as I could keep hitting this point I figured I might as well give you a sneak peek of what's inside the book so I'm going to read the first page to you is that all right you guys mind on that all right you have to sell stuff to make money it seems simple enough but everyone tries to skip to the make money part it doesn't work I tried you need all the pieces you need the stuff to sell and offer you need people to sell it to leads then you got to get all those people to buy it sales once you put all those in place then you can make money my first book 100 million dollar offers covers the first step and gives you the stuff it answers the age-old question what should I sell answer and offer so good people feel stupid saying no but strangers can only buy your stuff if they know you exist this takes leads leads mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people but most agree that they're the first step to getting more customers in simpler terms it means they've got the problem to solve and the money to spend if you're reading this book you already know that leads don't magically appear you need to go get them more precisely you need to need to help them need to help them find you so they can buy your stuff and the best part is you don't have to wait you can force them to find you you do that through advertising advertising the process of making known lets strangers know about the stuff you sell if more people know about the stuff you sell then you sell more stuff if you sell more stuff then you make more money having lots of leads makes it hard to be poor advertising lets you have a terrible product and still make money it lets you be terrible at sales and still make money it lets you make a ton of mistakes and still make money in short having this skill gives you endless chances to get it right and in the unforgiving world of business Second Chances are hard to come by so you might as well load up advertising is a skill worth having and this book 100 million dollar leads shows you exactly how to do it so here's what I'm going to do in our short time together number one share a few breakthrough experiences I had when learning how to advertise to save my businesses you will get my lesson without my scar two give you guys a bunch of money making stuff this one I can promise you will trust me three invite you to join me on my mission of making real business education accessible for everyone and four get out of your way so you can tear off the wrapping paper and dig into my last four years of work cool great so here's a visual of our journey together let's start with the first way that you get leads warm Outreach so here's how I learned it so here I am a defense contractor top secret clearance I'm 21 years old I'm not happy my work I wanted to start a business but I was too chicken maybe some of you guys are in this boat so I'd have started decided to start a fitness non-profit because I liked Fitness but I was still afraid to charge money and if I failed at a non-profit and still had my job it wouldn't hurt my status right safe bet but I wanted people who participated to have some skin in the game so they'd still care and try I called it the free training project this is my actual outside I was able to find it so the premise was simple people would donate 500 to a thousand dollars to the charity of their choice and I would train them online for no compensation and I'd give them nutrition workouts a weekly weekly eating out guide and answer questions in between and that idea was all great except I had no customers so I reached out to every one of my friends list 101 and I asked if they knew anyone who'd be interested I was like hey do you know anybody who's looking to get in shape and out of thousands of them six six said yes so they donated I trained them and months later they got results I still have the first six to this day eventually I wanted to make this a real business but they were paying a charity and not me so I asked them to start paying me directly I was the charity now and a few did and that's how I advertised to start my first business using warm Outreach AKA reaching out to people who know you one on one and learning to advertise this way saved me from a career I didn't enjoy and got me started on my entrepreneurial Journey you can look at the difference in my facial expression between these two pictures these are only a few months apart you can see how much this meant to me so that's how I learned worm Outreach here's how I used it for this book the cool part about where mountain is no matter how advanced you get you still use it for example I reached out to some of my buddies privately and asked them to come to my book launch event and they're here with us now and whether you're getting your first five customers your next five customers or you're launching a new product in a division of a company it often starts the same way with warm Outreach and the best part is you can start using it the moment you get off this presentation today so that's how I learned it here's how I used it for this book oh sorry here's how you use for the book here's where you can use it today so warm Outreach works on email phone call direct messages physical mail voicemails carrier pigeons anything where you talk to people one-on-one all right on platforms like these so that's where you can use it today now let's talk about the second way to get leads posting free content so here's how I learned it now after I had some customers I wanted more but I didn't know how because I had already messaged my entire contact list so I made a post so here was my first ever public advertisement you can see it April 9 2013 Baltimore Maryland which is where I'm from everyone for those of you who know me you know two things one I am terrible with all things technological for example I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago seriously two I love training nutrition and fitness more than well a whole lot so today is sort of special because it marks a day where my love of training vanquished see me being fancy here vanquished my fear of Technology what do I mean for the better part of a year I've been taking part in a free personal training project with the idea that I would give away free personal training to anyone who is willing to give some of their 500 to a thousand dollars to a cause of their choice this way they wouldn't have to be motivated by the same thing as me but be motivated to give to their cause and benefit themselves when I first introduced the idea I was happily surprised with the amount of positive support I received so almost a year for my first client I now have a website to formally show you some of the Transformations that have gone underway using my programming and as a formal means of contacting me about signing up I currently have a few slots open my roster so drop me a quick note if you're interested thanks so much take a quick second to check out the ridiculous transformations and unlike before I now had some proof I could advertise so I started making posts about what I was doing with my clients with some Fitness content in between so on the left you can see some of the fitness content and on the right you can see some of the testimonials and from that content in those testimonials over the next month I messaged anyone who interacted with any post I had and asked them if they wanted help and that gave birth to the body forward skinny to soil project you can see the date there and I signed up 20 guys at 200 bucks a month which equated at four thousand dollars a month learning how to advertise through making content allowed me to eat in the early days between my job and before I started my first gym learning to get leads through posting saved me from a life I didn't want it gave me the resources that I needed to learn more now what I didn't know is that I had unknowingly stumbled on the second way you can advertise posting content AKA you post content to people who know you one to many so that's how I learned it here's how I use it for this book so we recorded content months prior to the launch and planned it out and this was our actual calendar so you can see I had 17 shorts filmed I had six long forms filmed we had 143 total posts 20 sorry 143 total lead post 2200 total posts and that was across Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Tick Tock YouTube shorts and threads all right and I want to pause here because I think it's an important lesson that it took me too long to figure out which is that if you do have an audience or you do start posting content if you do want to start promoting something you don't want to just stop posting the stuff that your entire audience is there for and then only start talking about your thing you keep talking about your thing as much as you were before and then start your promotions on top of that which means you actually need to do even more during that period of time if you want to promote something and I think this is one of the big mistakes that a lot of people make when they are trying to promote something to an audience and so combining the leads post with the content post this is over 300 pieces per week and here are the resulting Impressions from those posts over 400 million impressions and we use the same content framework in every post to maximize the likelihood that we hook retain and reward people for clicking consuming and coming back that is the hook retain reward framework you'll see it again and that resulted in 194 000 registrations so almost half of you guys here today and here's the craziest thing if you were to pay for those cpms at 20 bucks each that's three million dollars a month in free advertising that's how powerful this is so that's how I used it for this book here's how you can use it today so the fact that I got my first customers from organic content then and built the following that we have now is why I can tell you that it worked then and it works now and although the platforms may change the principles remain the same and like anything you can scale this from one post a week to 250 posts a week so you can do this in tiny amounts or huge amounts it works the same and here are some examples of platforms available to do this on today you got YouTube Shorts YouTube Longs podcasts SiriusXM Radio LinkedIn tick tock Instagram stories Instagram reels Instagram posts Twitter and more so let's talk about the third way to get leads running paid ads so here's how I learned it now back to our story once I had clients from posting content I wanted more noticing a recurring theme Here so I started shadowing at a gym the gym owner Sam didn't use any paid advertising he used a method called Groupon to get new customers some of you younger Lads might not remember this but some of the older folks in the room will after watching how it worked I was convinced I could do the same thing and launch my own gym so right before I left this gym to start my own I remember calling a mentor I said okay so here's how it works you get a hundred people who buy your Groupon every month for 39 bucks and from there you get 40 of them to stay for 150 bucks a month so you get paid to get new customers and every month you add another 6 000 per month in recurring Revenue he was like I'm not sure it's going to be that easy but you have my blessing so I went out signed my first lease and started my Groupon but nothing happened crickets so here I am freaking out that I just signed my life away with no way to get leads and here's the part of the story that many of my audience don't know so I was actually supposed to have a partner at my first location and two weeks before our location was supposed to open he said hey we should go to this marketing seminar cost three grand they guarantee that if you don't make 10 grand by the end of the weekend they'll give your money back and despite being quite broke I obviously said I could use 10 grand let's go and so over those two days I didn't make 10 grand but I did learn about this thing called Facebook ads then when I got back from that Workshop something unexpected happened we broke up my partner backed out of the partnership so I had to use the rest of my savings to pay his half to open the gym so here I am sleeping on the floor with no clients I owe rent in weeks I have one month saved up so I put up the ugliest ad you've ever seen just like I'd learned at the workshop I'm looking for five local residents to take place in a free six-week challenge you must let us use your performing after pictures in our Marketing in exchange for the program click the link to sign up no images no videos no frills just words all caps and it worked I signed up 29 members before I opened in the city I knew no one I actually ended up sending this picture to my father to show them that I was doing something good and funny enough the cash I collected from them was exactly enough to pay my rent I still remember the business account going to zero at the end of the month woof but the next month I spent more money on ads and got more customers and then more and learning how to run ads allowed me to start my gym in Huntington Beach on my own without a partner without savings without knowing anyone and if I had not learned how to run paid ads on a random weekend I would not be standing in front of you today truly if I hadn't learned how to get leads my gym would have gone under in less than a month because I only had a month saved up and I would have had to go back to this job as a failure and that would have sucked simply put learning to run paid ads gave me the ability to survive long enough to figure out what I was doing and just like that I had learned the third way that you can let other people know about your stuff paid ads AKA letting strangers know one to many so that's how I learned them here's how I used it for this book so for this book launch we ran paid ads on these platforms YouTube Shorts YouTube songs Facebook Instagram reels Instagram stories Instagram posts and tick tock and I followed the exact steps in this book so that you could all go back and look at them as examples to model I wrote These simple ads using this simple three-step framework from the book The what who when framework I go into very deep description of every aspect of how you can script A Nat and how you get endless variations with one framework and then these ads got these results we spent 275 000 we got 137 000 of you here and our cost per lead is about two bucks and I pushed them to this simple landing page which I got directly from the book this is layout number two and it had a 55 opt-in rate for those who know what that is are you guys seeing how we use the stuff in the book to advertise the book itself you guys getting that getting some hands on the screens you guys getting that all right AKA proof that this stuff works so that's how I use it for this book here's how you can use it today you can use it on all these platforms Hulu radio LinkedIn Tick Tock Spotify Instagram Twitter podcast and more and the best part is if you know what you're doing you can immediately start using paid ads to get leads for your business today they're the fastest way to get more leads especially if you're like I was with no one knowing you like I was in Hudson Beach when I started right and they work even if you have no following and you can start with as little as a few dollars a day and you can scale them as much as you want for example today across our portfolio we spend more than a million dollars per week in ads and a lot of people try and make it sound complicated they're not they only make them sound complicated because they understand them well enough yet to explain them simply I must say that again people only make ads sound complicated because they don't understand them well enough to make them simple because once you do understand them they're easier than you think so that's pretty much what I did for a while I kept posting content I kept reaching out to folks and running paid ads and that's how I scaled my gyms and was able to eventually sell my locations and that's when I started my next company gym launch our licensing business when everything went really right for context over the next four years we took out 40 million dollars in owner distributions and then something terrible happened and it went really wrong really fast and so I was forced to get a new way to get leads which brings us to the fourth way to get leads cold Outreach so here's how I learned it so whoosh it's 20 20. and I uh hit puberty again and now I've scaled and sold my gyms I'm now scaling gym launcher gym licensing company using all the methods that I've discussed so far but all of a sudden covet hits and 100 of my customers aren't allowed to do business so here's what happened month one fifteen percent of gyms permanently close by month six another 15 percent of gyms permanently close meaning 30 percent of all gyms are forever out of business with the rest seriously struggling my clients are scared my employees are scared my ads are failing and somehow I have to figure out a way to get more customers and I'm not really sure what to do so one morning I wake up early and check my Instagram and I see a new message it says hey Alex kill told me you guys don't need salesman anymore so my offer got pulled I quit my job to accept it I'm super honored as you consider me I hope you consider me again next time you have openings I scrolled up in the conversation I was the one who had told him to apply I felt horrible so I messaged him I was like you on and he was so he hopped on a call here's how the conversation went so he said he worked at a gym software company doing 10 million a month I was like holy cannoli I was like okay well uh how do you guys get clients he's like oh we're 100 outbound I was like huh so then I asked him what was that offer that kale pulled he's like oh it's going to be a closer I was like huh well you think you could do that outbound stuff here he's like yeah I could do it I'm confident I can make it profitable in 90 days so I said deal I'll front you the time of the money to spin this up and so I hired him and we built an outbound machine together and so here's what happened over the next few months September the first month zero sales zippola nothing October two sales December for sales January six sales February 10 sales March 14 sales April 20 sales May 30 sales and 480 000 in monthly Revenue cold Outreach save gym launch during its hardest time during covid and it was pivotal in making it a sellable company that didn't rely on my face and keep growing to this day the company is up 45 from what I sold without bound equating to over 50 of sales learning to advertise with cold outbound kept my company alive and that's how I learned cold Outreach which is simply privately letting people know who don't know you about your stuff AKA advertising one to one to strangers so that's how I learned it here's how I used it for this book so I reached out to people to ask to be on their podcast to speak about the book I was like are you going to build your podcast they're like you sure can and this is actually a more advanced move combining two types of advertising which I'll get to later but if you see a boatload of podcasts come out after the book is out that's where many of them came from so that's how I use it for the book here's how you can use it today you can knock on 100 Doors you can send 100 DMS you can make 100 calls you can leave 100 voicemails all you got to do is get away to contact them figure out what to say contact them until they're ready and able to listen that's it and you can do it on all these platforms SMS DMS emails LinkedIn messenger Instagram messenger Twitter messenger voicemail physical mail and of course carrier pigeons and you can start with a tiny budget all you need is time a way to contact people and knowing what to say when they reply that's all you need and you can scale all the way up using other people's time and automation and the best part is you get to pick who you reach out to you pick your own leads so you can make sure that you only reach out to the most qualified Perfect Fit highest value targets for example if you only want to reach out to hedge fund managers over a billion dollars in assets under management you can do that for context within our portfolio we do a total of 15 000 plus reach outs per day and generate zillions that's the actual number zillions of engaged leads per day as a result as a fun proof Point Jim launch has spoken to not reached out to spoken to 25 000 gym owners so I'm being clear they've gotten on the phone with 25 000 gym owners in an industry of only 150 000 gyms in health clubs all right that's one out of six of all gyms and that's how you can know this stuff works so now you know the four methods of advertising which I call the core four they're the only four ways you can let other people know about your stuff core four number one warm Outreach core for number two posting free content cool for number three running paid ads call for number four cold Outreach but the natural question is are there other ways to advertise and the answer is yes and no you on your own cannot advertise in other ways but other people can for you and I called those people the four lead getters you've got customers employees agencies and Affiliates and Lead Getters using the core4 complete the advertising cycle for example let's say you post free content to tell people about your stuff and get customers who then tell other people about your stuff using warm Outreach and you get more customers or let's say you run paid ads to tell people about your stuff and get Affiliates who then tell other people about your stuff by posting free content to their audiences and you get more customers and so the most efficient way to advertise is to let other people do it on your behalf because only two people can let strangers know about the stuff you sell you and other people and there are more of them than there are of you and I can explain the insane power of lead Getters with one simple comparison on one hand you can do the core four all day every day to get leads your work is high your leads are low your Leverage is lowest on the other hand you can get one person to get an army of lead getters to do the core four for you so your work is now low your leads are high and your Leverage is highest in other words in the second scenario you work way less but you get four times the leads and that's the insane power of lead Getters and once you know how to harness them you can get as many leads as you darn well please without spending your time on it it's how our portfolio generates twenty thousand plus leads per day without me doing any advertising for them to get leads to be clear I advertise to get portfolio companies but I don't advertise for my portfolio companies to get customers and that's leverage the difference between what you put in and what you get out and that's how you build a 100 million dollar leads machine the same one that got five hundred thousand plus of you amazing individuals here today and I don't have time to get to explain the other four lead Getters in detail but let me at least give you the gist you don't do lead Getters you do the core four to get them and then they do the core four on your behalf so let me give you a couple examples so first and simplest you have customers who then get you other customers it's how my last book sold 467 000 copies with zero dollars in paid ads so real quick who you heard about this event from someone else or because you read the last book drop a thumb in the chat give me some thumbs who here came for that came because of that reason Bernie did Nicholas did Javier did William did Charles did Nicholas another Nicholas Suzanne all right great this referral stuff works then you've got employees who do the core four on your behalf which is how Mosey media our team made the 143 book posts of content and 2200 plus pieces in the last six weeks so real quick how many of you guys saw content about this event drop a thumb in the chat who here came from content rather than because you read the last book or someone told you to great Tyron Jacob this team stuff works then you've got agencies who post content run ads or do Outreach on your behalf that's who actually click the button since we don't actually run ads for our holding company we're a holding company we don't actually transact and so we had an agency run the ads on our behalf so real quick who here heard about this event from Paid ads that you saw paid ads is that what made you click and come in Click a thumb or drop a thumb in the chat Santiago Marguerite Jawad all right Vaughn there we go great that's how you can know that this stuff works today so then you've got Affiliates who do the core forward of Their audience on your behalf which is how we had 23 722 Affiliates post content run ads and email their lists about this event real quick who here heard about this event from another business drop a thumb in the chat Greg arika Raphael Lauren Robbie Mona so for the many of you who are here because someone else referred you from another business thank you over a hundred and four thousand three hundred and sixty one of you are here from affiliates and that's how you know this affiliate stuff works and the result of using the core four and the four lead Getters is proof everyone here today and that's how you know this stuff works and it'll work for you okay so far in this presentation we covered you make more money when more people find out about your stuff when you double your leads you double your business there are only two types of people who can get you leads you and other people we talked about the core four why these companies hit billions overnight AKA advertising we talked about warm reach outs we talked about posting content we talked about the hook retain reward framework we talked about how I use paid ads for this book we talked about the best landing page templates we talked about how I learned cold Outreach we talked about how to get leverage with lead Getters talk to how I use customer referrals to get even more leads and how we used our team to get even more leads and how we used advertising agencies to get even more leads and how we used Affiliates to get even more leads and that's how you know this stuff works and it'll work for you after all warm Outreach work to get my first customers posting content work to make enough for me to quit my job paid ads work to keep my gym from failing before even began and even eventually grew cold Outreach worked to save gym launch during covid and made it a sellable business referrals work to explode 100 million dollar offers employees work to make the content to remote this event agency work to run the ads for this event and 23 722 Affiliates work to advertise this book event to get a hundred and four thousand three hundred and sixty one of you here can you see how knowing how to get leads can give you the freedom to pursue the business or life you want can you see how learning to use these eight advertising methods can 2x 5x 100x your business can you see how learning how to get leads on demand gives you endless chances to figure it out in short can you see why advertising AK knowing how to get leads is a skill worth having and this skill may just be the bridge between where you are and wherever you want to go it has been for me great so here's what I know even if we had a full day together instead of just 90 minutes it's gonna be hard almost impossible for me to give you all that I could give you no matter how good anyone is one 90 minute presentation isn't going to change your life you need more than that and while everything I've given you today is valuable it's just the tip of the iceberg and if you like what I've shared with you so far you'll love what I have for you next you see before today I was faced with one of two choices the first option was to part ways with you and then just hope that you on your own would figure it out my second option was I could take a more active role in responsibility for your success and create a win-win situation I chose the second option the result of working six hours a day for two years everything I know about generating 100 million plus a year in sales everything I know about getting leads from a decade of advertising and so it's with great pleasure to introduce you to the 100 million dollar lead system with this system you will wield all eight methods as a master of advertising getting leads on command at prices your competition would drool over so here's what you guys are gonna get this is about to get bananas so just buckle up that's my warning that's my disclaimer before we rock and roll here if you're someone who doesn't get enough replies or opt-ins or your web pages don't convert or people don't trust you enough to buy or your religious play don't cost too much then pay attention this is for you lead magnet mastery all right now you might be wondering what's a lead magnet a lead man is a complete solution to a narrow problem it's the free thing giveaway before you're paid things you can get more people to buy here's how it'll make you money let's say you sell widgets all right if you go up to 100 people on the street and say hey buy my widget maybe one of them will buy everyone else will say pound sand I don't know who you are I don't trust you now let's introduce a lead magnet before your core offer so you go up to the same hundred people and say hey can I give you some value for free can I solve this problem for you for free a greater percentage of those people say yeah you can solve that problem for me and now with that bigger pool of people that you have now gained trust and solve the problem for you say hey I solved that first problem but now you've got the second problem let me solve that for you in exchange for money and then more than one of those people will say yes making a lead magnet the right way can 2x 5x sometimes 10x the leads that you have while adding value to the marketplace this is a big part I think people miss about lead magnets is that of course when you have the right lead magnet you make way more sales but what people Miss is that you actually also provide Goodwill to the marketplace because 99 of people are never going to buy from you and that's okay that's how it works but they are the ones who will build your reputation and so if you provide free value to the marketplace you build your reputation while also making more sales and that's the secret power of lead magnets now to show how powerful this is I personally took on a group of 10 businesses on my software Allen to implement the lead magnet system they were in Chiropractic online fitness Dental Physical Therapy in-home services in real estate and even flow tanks and here are their actual numbers from implementing the system all right so you can see one through ten you can see at the bottom we had some stragglers with some people who didn't do very much and you can see at the top we had some people who did a lot each company who fully adopted the new lead man exploded in revenue and growth in fact in the first 90 days each business went through went from zero to six thousand a month in additional Revenue to month two 19 000 a month in additional Revenue to month three thirty four thousand dollars a month in additional Revenue so the average business went up by month three to thirty four thousand nine hundred seventy two dollars on average and that included the folks that did nothing so you could say this worked and so here's what lead magnet Masters show you how to do step one figure out the best problem to solve all right this is probably one of the biggest mistakes people make when they're when they're picking lead matches actually solving the wrong problem there are problems you solve that get people to buy and they're problem solved that waste your time you got to pick the right ones second figure out how to solve it third figure out how to deliver it fourth test what to name it because if they don't like what you name it they're never going to consume it to begin with which brings it to number five which is make it easy to consume because they don't consume it they're not going to get value if they don't give value they're not going to buy step six make it darn good there's a specific way that I approach lead Max that make them better and make their increase their perception of value that can dramatically change the buy rates afterwards and finally step seven make it easy for them to tell you they want more this sounds crazy but step seven is actually the number one thing that people miss when they are making lead magnets and why they give a lead magnet away and then no one buys in fact this system alone permanently 17 extra applications at acquisition.com in three months so this is 2022 so I already still had a lot of traffic we had a relatively big audience even last year and this was when you introduced a new lead man using this and I was already doing Millions a month before discovering this new way that 17x my Elites all right so for you do you think you can at least double your lead flow overnight probably for me the system cost me twenty three thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars in development and three months of tests to figure out the hard slow and expensive way but I want to save you the three months of trial and error and the twenty three thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars it took me to learn this and just give you the fast Jeep and easy way is that cool this is so valuable you can literally do nothing else I show you just use lead magnet Mastery and double your leads tomorrow which I value today at only a fraction of my investment of time money at 997 dollars so that's the first thing you're going to get now oh I've got more if you haven't started your business yet or you want to start a side hustle or you're about to launch a new project or you have less than 20 customers then pay attention I made this for you the first five clients framework here's how it'll make you money let's say you want to get leads for a new thing on a zero dollar budget you're going to want a way to advertise that's reliable low risk repeatable and low cost and warm Outreach is a single advertising method that best meets these requirements so if you need to get customers this is the fastest cheapest and most certain way to get them and using room Outreach the right way we'll get you the first five customers that you need to start the business quit the job or launch the new product in fact Alexis used the principles from first five clients from to start her first online business and got her first three customers in her first month and then got three more customers the next month and then got three more customers the next month and then she used some of the more advanced stuff that I'm going to show you in a second and went from three customers per month to three customers a week and the best part is the first five clients from X Works no matter what you sell so here's what I'll show you how to do step one get your list step two pick the right platform step three personalize your message step four reach out so I'll give you the exact scripts the exact openers the things that we do the ACA framework that we've used to massage customers and Prospects to get them to want to buy step six get them to invite their friends step seven how to make the easiest offer in the world this is the one that everyone wants to say yes to and especially if you're starting out I'll just give it to you that way people say yes to you on the first shot step eight how to get the most from your leads which is there's three ways you can monetize leads I'll show you all three nine how how much and when to start charging especially when you're starting out getting the right price and knowing when to start charging someone and how much is one of the most confusing parts I'll show you step-by-step process that works every time in Step 10 I'll show you how to keep your list warm so it keeps bringing you leads month after month after month this is step by step the exact system that I used to get my first clients for free all right this system cost me two years of working a job I didn't love and two years of lost income to figure out the not fun way so that's a picture of me 10 years ago but I want to save you the two years it took me to figure it out and just give you the shortcut aka the fun way you can so you can start tomorrow and for many of you here today this is the only thing you need to quit your job and start that business that you have been thinking about and even though quitting your job and pursuing your dream is priceless to make sure you can actually get started I value the first five clients from I can only fraction of my investment time money at 297 dollars so here's what you get you get a lead magnet Mastery so you can get way more leads than you currently are you can get the first five clients Frameworks you can get your first five clients for free total value 12.94 . now I want to talk to somebody else in the audience if you're someone who wants to build a personal brand or you want to add boatloads of free media to your business or build a warm audience then I made this for you the MOSI media content method for the first time ever we're opening up the kimono of what we actually did to build this brand and so here's how posting content the right way makes you money one it will grow your audience as a natural consequence when you grow your audience you get more buyers and here's the third one that people don't expect is that when you do this all other lead methods benefit so let me explain so let's say you use warm Outreach or paid ads to get customers well if someone clicks on an ad a lot of us don't actually immediately buy you click on an ad and then you click the profile you consume some content you see if someone's legit and then you go back and buy and so if you have content there done the right way you'll actually lift all other lead generation methods you'll get way more leads for less money and this is in addition to the people that actually come in from the content itself for many of you can cut your lead cost in half while also growing your sales and so here's what the most immediate content method will show you how to do number one hook attention get them to notice your content so I'll show you how we pick great topics there's five buckets that I use every time that are completely unique to the individual so you never have to look like another Mickey Mouse copy paste person ever again B we did a we looked at a 50-year meta-analysis of news headlines the most viral news headlines that got shared the most and rather than give you a formula there are seven Timeless themes that humans respond to and I'll show you how to put those themes into your headlines without having to follow some you know cookie cutter format which brings me to C how to structure the content to get shared sometimes you have the same content formatted differently and then boom it gets a hundred times the views are reach but once they notice your content you got to get them to consume it so you have to retain the attention so I'll show you how to use lists steps and stories to keep people watching and then finally reward attention which is satisfy the reason they consumed it to begin with all right how do you keep promises elegantly and this is the important part at the right times a lot of people keep promises too early or don't do it at all or keep the wrong promise and if you do it the right way you get a massive lift in the amount of people who share it this is the exact system that I used to get from here to here and get almost half of everyone here today and it took me two years to figure it out and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month in payroll but I'm not going to ask you for two years of your life and 3.6 million dollars I'm just going to hand you the keys this is literally what Built My Brand my most valuable asset in 24 months and it can help you build one too which I value today at a thousandth of my investment in time and money at one thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars so here's what you get number one is I'll show you how to cut your lead cost in half using lead magnet Mastery number two you're gonna get your first five clients so you can pick whatever platform you want to get customers on you're going to get the most immediate content method so you can build the brand that you want to have authority in whatever space you're in total value 3291 now let's say you're in the opposite situation you never want to be the face you hate being on camera or making content or you hate the constantly changing platform algorithms but you still want to make consistent sales that I made this for you the cold Outreach Playbook so here's what code Outreach is also number one you don't need to be good on camera number two you don't need to make tons of content number three your competition will never know what you're doing so you can operate in secrecy I told you earlier there's a 10 million a month business in Myspace I don't even know they existed because they used outbound four if you do enough volume it becomes incredibly reliable in short once you have it going you become very hard to stop I already told you this Playbook has been worth millions to me getting this advertising method going can 5x the value of your business and now I use it across our portfolio to instantly and reliably grow their sales and value and at the very least once you implement it you can sleep well at night knowing you'll always have leads in fact Miguel used the principles from cold Outreach playbook for his local business he needed to get new customers so you add it in outbound and within 90 days he had his first hundred thousand dollar a month all right check out his Revenue growth from cold Outreach so month one he was just doing his normal business and then boom he added in the color Outreach Playbook and doubled his business and then the next month he maintained his Revenue thereafter and you can see his comment there and so here's what cold hours play we'll show you how to do step one get a way to contact them get your leads so I'll show you how to buy lists how to scrape lists using software and how to manually assemble this if you're dead broke step two I'll show you how to know what to say all right so the exact voicemail scripts that we use the exact email scripts that we use the exact follow-up scripts that we use the exact DM scripts that we use and the warm-up Scripts so how to personalize the messages at scale to get replies and what to say when they reply and how to convince strangers to take the next step and then finally step three contact them when they're ready and able to listen so I'll show you how we automate delivery and automate distribution so that you can get way more replies for Less effort and the perfect follow-up sequence I told you 15 000 reach outs a day we know what the Cadence is I'll tell you it works best in fact this is the exact step-by-step process that we scaled during covid as a gym company so think about how ridiculous this is that was the sales growth we had during covid as a gym company that's how reliable this is once you get it going and it was the largest contributor to our 46.2 million dollar exit during covid so if it was the missing link for us then it can certainly work for you now no matter what your economic condition is around you and for me the system cost me 150 000 in payroll in six months of tests to figure out the painful way but I want to save you the six months of trial and error and the 150 000 it took me to learn this and just give you the winning lottery numbers you just got to cash them in you could literally ignore everything else I taught you today and use this to figure out the one message you need to send to make money and never worry about where you get your next sale from again that's it which would be life-changing for you but I value it today at a fraction of my investment time money at one thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars so you're gonna lead magnet Mastery so you can make banging lead magnets that people want to buy from you after you can get the first five clients Frameworks so that you can get your first five clients for free even if you have no dollars right now the most media content method that will help you build a brand that other people want to pay you money to get in front of your audience for that you can either choose not to or you can sell them stuff on your own the cold Outreach playbook for people who don't want to be on camera but still make money total value 52.88 now let's say you're the type person who wants to get leads fast Ricky Bobby style and have a higher risk tolerance and when I'm on a smaller team as you scale then you're going to love this the paid ads Playbook here's why they're awesome they're the closest thing to legally printing money they always work it's just a matter of how well you don't need to spend more time to get more reach you just crank the spend you don't need an audience or a reputation you can test this with tiny budgets and you can scale them with the fused Revenue fewest humans per dollar Revenue and they're way way simpler than people make them out to be and despite my organic reputation I made my fortune running ads so believe me when I understand when I say that I understand where you're at if you don't have the life you want this is my bank account on December 20th of 2016. this is not that long ago and then I cracked paid ads and 24 months later this was my income after I expensed everything I can imagine cracking paid ads can be among the fastest changes in wealth you ever experience if you get it right it can 100x your business for me at 20 000 X to my bank account is probably because it was so low so I feel qualified to speak on the top and give you the secrets that most people don't teach so here's what paid ads Playbook will show you how to do number one know where to advertise 99 of the time people are just starting the wrong place number two get the Right audience to see it I can promise you if you get the right person to see your ads your ads don't even have to be that good number three make the best ad for them to see and the nice thing is that humans have not changed so you can follow the exact same process over and over again step four get permission to contact them because at the end of the day if they don't give you permission there's nothing you can do from there and this is the exact system I use to script every ad you saw over the past six weeks which I followed to a t to demonstrate that it works here are the actual results from only one platform so you can see here it's about two bucks a lead just to give you some context people who run events like this generally pay between 10 and 50 dollars per lead this is way less and across all platforms paid ads brought in 137 000 of you today and in case you're curious these ads converted the same prices to cold audiences so with this you'll be able to get way more better cheaper leads faster more reliably period so here's the deal it took me half a decade to learn how to do this and another half a decade to perfect the system and that was hard but I want to save you the losing everything twice stage in the five years of sucking for those of you know my story and just give the cheat codes to get it right the first time you can skip every other Playbook and get one profitable paid ads campaign printing money and cover the investment for this entire system for the rest of your life all right which could create generational wealth for you but I value today at only fraction my investment at 1 997 so you can get lead magnet Mastery so you can immediately get more leads from whatever platforms you're on you get the first five client framework you're gonna get the most immediate content method everything that we do opening up the kimono to show you how to scale your business the cold Outreach Playbook so that you can get leads bulletproof as long as you have a phone as long as you have an internet connection you can get customers the paid ads Playbook which scales faster than any other way to get customers total value 72.85 now let's say you're the type of person who loves building great products or wants to build somebody that lasts generations and love taking care of customers and prefer to go with the highest profit margins possible then I get it which is why I made this for you the referral Playbook so what's a referral you might ask a referral happens when somebody a referrer sends an Engaged lead to your business anyone can refer but the best referrals come from your customers so here's how it'll make you money referrals are both worse worth more and cost less which is a dangerous combo for making money as a business and here's why this matters imagine you have a four to one return on Advertising that means for every one dollar you put in you get four dollars back and then you use the referral Playbook and get every customer to refer one more customer so you go from four to one to eight to one but in reality those four would then get you another four into infinity and this is how you make crazy profits but at the end of the day to grow forever you just got to get more customers to refer than exit that's it and once you do that you can grow as big as you want in fact this referral Playbook generated 300 000 a week in sales for us to gym launch the best part is we found out by accident when my ads got shut off for two weeks and we still kept making sales but after realizing it happened by accident we reverse engineered what we had done and started doing it on purpose I spent the next six months interviewing all the best businesses in our Network and I took pages of notes then re-categorized them by topic and then look for common factors that they all had and there were six and then we started implementing them in our locations and like clockwork we could triple how many people stayed and how many people they sent and here's what the referral Playbook will show you how to do step one figure out your referral percentage to churn percentage all right that is the ratio that we will optimize for for the rest of this step two get more people to refer without asking them all right this is the result of those findings all right so I'll show you how to pick better customers how to set better expectations how to get more people better results how to get them faster results with just two aspects one is actually getting faster results the other is increasing their perception of speed you can do both how to keep making your stuff better and how to tell them what to buy next because if they don't know what to buy next you can be darn sure they're not going to do it in step three get more people to refer by asking well all right and so what I'm going to give you is my seven all-time best referral programs that you can Implement to get leads tomorrow all right you can just copy and paste them in fact Vadim copy and pasted one of my referral programs into his business and got 105 people and added 28 000 to his annual revenue for free because that's the beautiful thing about referrals it costs nothing while donating 2500 to Toys for Tots and serving his community which is my favorite way to do business do good and make good money hand in hand and this stuff works when you're starting out or when you're scaled all the way up and rather than ask you through the hundreds of interviews and Consulting process I just want to give you the answers to the test all right you could literally do nothing else I showed you today run one of my seven referral programs in this Playbook and get customers tomorrow all right which on its own would cover the investment from this entire program which would be life-changing for you but I value today only a fraction of my investment of time money at 997 dollars so here's what you get you get lead magnet Mastery you get the first five clients framework you get multimedia content method you get the cold Outreach Playbook you get the paid ads Playbook you get the referral Playbook total value 8282 now if you're the type of person who loves building relationships and you believe in expanding the size of the pie and finding win-win scenarios and want to create long-term allies on your entrepreneurial Journey then you're going to love this the affiliate Playbook so what's an affiliate an affiliate is a lead getter they are an independent business that tells Their audience to buy your stuff Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside but are much different under the hood first they have their own businesses and do their own advertising second they agree to offer your stuff to get to their engaged leads in exchange for money free stuff or both and so here's how Affiliates make you more money so consider these two scenarios scenario one you sell 10 customers per month worth ten thousand dollars each your business grows to a hundred thousand dollars per month now mind you you can change the zeros all right it doesn't really matter but the concept Remains the Same all right assuming no other advertising or business plateaus in 12 months you've made 1.2 million dollars your Leverage is low again this could be twelve hundred dollars twelve thousand dollars 1.2 million or 120 million it doesn't matter but the leverage of how you built it Still Remains low because you're the one getting customers now let's look at scenario two you sell 10 Affiliates per month not customers you sell 10 Affiliates per month and then each affiliate sells you one new customer per month for you and so every month you add another hundred thousand dollars of Revenue on top of last month so it looks like this the first month you get 10 Affiliates to send you 10 customers the next month you get another 10 Affiliates who send you another 10 customers for a total of 20 new customers the next month another 10 Affiliates for children of 30 sending you 30 customers and Affiliates keep sending you customers and you keep growing in 12 months you've made 7.8 million dollars and it continues thereafter the key point is that in both scenarios you sell 10 humans per month it's either you sell 10 customers per month or you sell 10 Affiliates per month you guys see the difference but only scenario two keeps growing month after month after month with the same work same work more money leverage High isn't scenario two better that's a lot more money for the same work and the best part is it's free you just attach your offer to their offer and let them advertise for you so for example if I owned a massage studio I might tell six corporations I'll give all new employees a free massage right free massage for every employee now whenever they hire someone new they send their employees to me AKA free leads to me every month and that's all it is anyone can do this and it's 100 legal so the affiliate Playbook will show you how to step one find your ideal Affiliates step two make them a win-win offer which is really key if you noted for this event the win-win is that the top Affiliates I would provide value to Their audience rather than saying hey top Affiliates get a Lamborghini which would not add value to Their audience right you can structure way that everyone wins which is one of my favorite ways to use Affiliates step three train them to sell your stuff because if they don't know how to sell your stuff they're going to say the wrong thing and people have bad expectations step four figure out what to pay them we paid tens of thousands of dollars at gym launch for a consultant to come in who only sets up affiliate payment compensation programs and I'm going to give you everything they gave me all they do it's all yours step five get them advertising because you got them to this point now they got to get you leads in Step six once they get you leads you want to keep them getting you leads so you keep them advertising in fact these were the actual sales numbers from the First full month of sales from our supplement company Prestige Labs so you can see there 429 000 that was week one 383 411 404 000 with zero paid ads using 100 affiliates so if you're trying to add it up it was 1.7 million dollars per month and the best part was they took care of the advertising and the selling for us we just delivered the products now this was the second time I tried to launch Affiliates the first time was a complete disaster and it took me two years before I launched again and this time I documented all the mistakes that I'd made the first time and since then I've done 75 million dollars in sales from Affiliates between our portfolio companies and as a reminder that this works today this is the exact process I followed to get 23 722 Affiliates who promoted this event so you could skip every other section and only get one business to send you leads using this Playbook and cover the entire investment for this system for good which would transform your entire business and maybe your life but I value today only a fraction of my investment time money at one thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars so you'll get lead magnet Mastery which you can immediately use to get way more people to want your stuff that will eventually buy you'll have the first five client framework so that anyone can launch the new business quit the job launch the new product in whatever division you're in and get the first customers on board you'll have the most immediate content Playbook which we have never shown publicly everyone tries to look from the outside in to figure out what we do and how we do it this will show you step by step how we've scaled the cold Outreach Playbook which literally saved gem launch at its hardest time and was able to scale a gym company during covid because that's how bulletproof it is once you get it right the paid ads Playbook which has been the source of my material wealth and is the fastest way to get new customers even if you have no reputation the referral Playbook which is actually the Silicon Valley hack at getting unlimited free customers by taking your customers to get you more customers and then the affiliate Playbook which is where you lock arms with other businesses you find partners and you all charge forward together and you get to benefit from their advertising total value ten two seven nine so no matter which Playbook you choose to use you now have all the Infinity Stones and if you wanted to use more than one which I recommend you might be wondering how do I know which Playbook to use in what order which is why I outlined the zero to 100 million dollar scaling roadmap think of it as The Gauntlet that holds all the stones it breaks down the seven levels of scaling leads in advertising which will show you exactly what Playbook to use for your business right now and rather than go into detail in each level why don't I just show you what it looks like when you have them all so instead of wiping out the universe when you snap your fingers you'll turn them all into leads and so this is what it looks like at scale your media team scales tons of free content and all media Types on many platforms you regularly make offers to your warm audience to get more customers or Affiliates your audience Goodwill makes anything you launch immediately profitable you have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across multiple platforms your code Outreach teams get you more customers on autopilot you have affiliate managers launching and integrating all new Affiliates you have recruiters and recruiting agencies bringing in more lead Getters your product is so good that a third of your customers bringing more customers your executive team drives all this growth without you and you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle and that last part is the most important you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle in other words a 100 million dollar leads machine so remember I said earlier a man with an experience is never a immersive man with an opinion the reason I know this is what it looks like is because I lived it we cross 10 million a month using the exact roadmap that I just outlined my books and courses are my living documentation of that Journey mind you took me a while to figure this stuff out I was stuck for three years between 30 and 40 million a year until a mentor of mine told me why I was stuck then within two years we crossed 10 million a month so for me this road map has cost me a decade and every mistake that I've made and if you ignored everything else and simply got Clarity on what you should be doing to grow it would cover the cost of the entire investment which why I think it's fair to valued at one thousand seven hundred ninety seven dollars all right so you're gonna get lead magnet Mastery you're gonna get the first five plan framework you'll get the most immediate content method to build the brands you want you can get the cold Outreach Playbook so that you can get leads in any condition in any environment you're going to get the paid ads Playbook that you can crank with zero reputation to get more customers you're gonna have the referral Playbook that can give you the virality in the business you want that can scale with the highest margins and you're going to get the affiliate Playbook which allow you to partner with other businesses to get you more leads and the zero to 100 million dollar scaling roadmap from someone who's actually been there total value 12.76. this is all the stuff you're going to get listen these systems are more valuable than the masterminds that sell for twenty five thousand fifty thousand even a hundred thousand dollars from goobers who've never even done it and it will give you hilariously more value than a hundred thousand dollar four-year degree and you've seen this has produced a hundred million dollars in sales for me and my companies and a 46.2 million dollar exit in hard cost alone this has cost me over 10 million dollars to figure out what actually works and if you were to pay me hourly to teach you one-on-one based on my hourly earnings or last five years it would cost you two million dollars so if I were to price this and what it's truly worth I wouldn't have any issue asking you to invest 100 Grand to get the entire system and before I tell you the price let me ask you a question how much is double your lead flow worth an extra ten thousand a year an extra fifty thousand a year an extra hundred thousand a year extra million dollars a year hold that number in your head really think about it what is that worth if you knew beyond a shot of a doubt that it would happen wouldn't be worth at least that much because after 100 million dollar offers Nick tripled his cleaning business from 87 class to 252 clients and Bill took his Pizzeria from 13 000 a week to twenty thousand week adding 300 350 000 per year in sales and Aaron went from shrugging to make his online business work to netting 1.9 million in eight months and natural went from 100 000 a year in a small Market to 500 000 a year in a bigger Market an extra 400 000 a year and Dylan was able to not 2x 3x but 5x is business you can see in the bottom he said you've made me more money than I can ever hope to return thanks for all you do Bobby added 1.6 million to his income in eight months for all these guys it would have been worth it at any price and that's why 100 Elite system is a bargain at 1276 but consider this if all this did was give you enough money to quit your job like it did for me or allow you to start your first business like you did for me or save your business from closing like it did for me or if all this it was Triple your leads like I did for Xavier or if all this did was in 24 months because that's how long I've been doing this give you the skills to launch an event like this using only what's inside the system wouldn't it be worth it I think so too which is why it's an even bigger bargain and not 12076 but four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars because if every week all it does is get you one more customer one more referral one more affiliate it'll pay for itself in months or even weeks I mean Ivan didn't even have to finish my last last book to jump start his business all right and the best part is you only invest once but you get to keep making money using the skills for the rest of your life which is why skills are the best investment look if I put my last thousand dollars into the S P 500 in 2017 which returns nine percent a year today I'd only have twenty one hundred and eighty three dollars but instead I invested my last thousand dollars in the SME 500 skills and turned a thousand dollars into what we have now so which would you rather have four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars or your dream right me too which is why this may be the best offer I've ever given at not twelve thousand not four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars but two thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars but because I want each and every one of you to 2x 5x 10x your lead flow and your business over the next 12 months and I know how life-changing this system has been for me and my family and I want this to be affordable for everyone but still an investment I'm not going to ask for 1276 even though be totally reasonable and a bargain I'm not going to ask for 4 997 I'm not even gonna ask for two thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars I'm gonna give you access to everything we talked about today for a single payment of a single payment of it's free laughs I love you guys [Laughter] gotcha yes it's 100 free all right it's all yours that's my way of saying thank you for being a part of this movement you guys stoked you guys feeling it you guys feeling it you're like what did he forget oh wait there's more

now oh no we're not we're just believe it or not we're just getting going so now at the very beginning I said I was going to help two types of people today so I said number one for people who need to put their oxygen mask on and take care of themselves and their family I promise you I will help you get closer to that today for free period so you're going to want to wait until the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time and so do you feel like I kept my promise to group one great so now for everybody else this is for you for those of you who are in a position to help me pay it forward I'm going to show you how it's in your self-interest to help everyone else once you see that you'll see you can accomplish both our missions together so here's the deal I wrote 19 drafts of 100 million dollar leads I actually found some of my older ones so my very first version was lead generation and monetization structures right wasn't a very good name I found my V10 one hanging around and what you guys will get is v19 and I had four four full rewrites it took me six hours a day for nearly two years to bring this to you guys in the cleanest simplest most digestible way and every time I didn't want to rewrite something to make it a little bit clearer my editor would yell at me you'd be like there's a 17 year old kid who's going to sleep with this book under his pillow to get out of a situation you owe it to him and that's what got me through this you guys I enjoy writing but it's a hard process but I stand here now confident that this is my best work today so it's with a lot of Pride that I present to you the 100 million leads collector's edition hardback but before I tell you where you can grab your copy who here's life is made better by the content the courses and the books put a money bag in the chat you can wave too you can you can do both if you feel like if you're feeling extra peppy today you guys glad you showed up you guys glad you showed up then you already know if you dropped the money bag or you're raising your hand and you've gotten value from the content the books the courses then you already know how life transforming skills can be so help me share them give a book to two friends and as a token of my appreciation I'll give you my hat so let me tell you why this happened so much to me because in the early days whenever I started a business the first thing I did was make a hat it made the little idea ahead of my head feel real a bit of proof I could hold in my hands and many times it felt like the realest part of my dream and today this hat is a visual reminder of my commitment to our new mission to make real business education accessible to everyone and until today there was only one way you could own this hat and it was by working at acquisition.com which is why I wanted this to stay earned not bought and I never want to lose that so if you believe what we believe in giving first in thinking long in doing the work that others won't and keeping your promise in a world that breaks them and delaying gratification in skills and education being the ultimate Legacy in being one of zero then grab a three pack and give a book to two friends change someone's life and pay it forward and I'll give you my hat as a token of my appreciation for me you can go to shop.acquisition.com and to be clear when you share these books you will have earned this hat you can go to shop.acquisition.com so you can go to that link you can grab yours now you can share the books with co-workers and employees your friend group your clients For an upcoming event for your birthday or holiday or because the Collector's Editions will just be worth more than any other version of the book or because it's like the closest thing doing a Harry Potter release except for entrepreneurs or having the physical copy will just be a super status gift since they're going to be so few of them in the run out immediately or because you and your people want to read at the same time which is how Layla and I do things so all I do is I ask you to share them so now that we've covered that I've got good news and I've got bad news the good news is in six months mosination Grew From Here to here now for the bad news I had to order books here but I didn't know we'd grow to here so I only have 150 000 hardbacks and 30 000 hats on hand and even though I'm limiting everyone to a hundred books per order we will definitely run out very fast so just to put this in perspective they're just under 200 000 of you here right now live which is already way more than the amount of hats that I have and we might have been okay except on top of that there's another 500 000 plus people watching this replay as soon as it finishes so you've got two hundred thousand people live another 500 000 gonna watch the Replay for a total 500 000 plus people and that might have been okay but on top of that there's another 1.5 million people planning to watch this on YouTube immediately after this is over for context this is only my YouTube subscribers and we're going to be sharing it across all platforms and this was the last video I posted which already has 1.5 million views this is just my last video and so there's just under 200 000 of you live 500 000 watching the replay another 1.5 million heard me watching it on YouTube for a total of two million people we're gonna be watching this presentation and that might have but on top of that there's another 23 722 Affiliates who are going to be sharing this presentation in this offer and these hats

remember that books are heavy and governments require sales tax you can take it up with your local government all right just FYI and for those who are international I'm gonna repeat this again later because it Bears repeating if you're International these shipping rates are insane all right they're nuts there are more than the cost of the book it's like buying a book of air ticket to fly over the

will all come via the email that you registered for this event so don't check an email that you didn't register for this event for so check the email you registered for this event for the digital stuff oh y'all thought I was done wait did you guys think I was done okay I'm not done one more thing and by the way uh we had to have uh a team of people coding all through everything to make sure

listening if you're reloading the page not a big one so one more thing I have one more promise to deliver on what about the exclusive bonus for everyone who came here live and believe me when I said it would be worth it what are you guys going to get that everyone not here isn't is going to regret not being your life for well over the last four years I've been carefully collecting notes from my last two books 100 million dollar leads oops wrong side here we go my magic my magicians my magicians thing 100 million dollar leads and 100 million dollar offers I've been collecting notes from my last two years and I spent countless hours curating them in a digestible way so you could see them see how much work went into these some of these simple Frameworks like the value equation like the offer headline formula you see those Frameworks don't magically appear I have to work really hard to turn them into Frameworks that stand the test of time for example this was how many iterations it took me to come up with the table of contents the table of contents for this book 100 million dollar offers all right so check this out version one version two version three version four version five version six version seven version eight version nine if you guys are getting bored imagine drawing every one of these little things version 10 version 11 version 12 version 13 version 14 version 15 version 16. final and again those little drawings take some time if you guys didn't know that I'm the one who draws the pictures by the way I get asked like yeah I'm the one who draws all the pictures in the books and so as an exclusive bonus for everyone here today you're all going to get a copy of 100 million dollar Journal absolutely free 278 pages of Frameworks which includes all the drawings and iterations with videos explaining how each concept came to be and you can see there the first uh as the first iteration of the value equation for those who know what it is so think of this as the behind the scenes look or the director's cut of creating the books and courses all right this will give you a much deeper understanding behind the concept so you internalize them rather than memorizing them the point is never to memorize the points to learn and that's why I wanted to show you the process so that you could go through it with me and get to the same conclusion just faster it'll be sent straight to your inbox after this is over and this is I want to be very clear only for you guys here live today no one else will get this you guys decided to show up you guys decided to take Saturday for my Aussies my new zealanders who are up at three o'clock in the morning right now partying here because you guys want it and believe me means the world to me I actually can't even explain how much it means to me it it's unbelievable um this is just for you guys here today and so here's all the free money making stuff that you guys get just for being here today number one the 100 million dollar lead system number two the 100 million dollar leads audiobook number three the 100 million dollar Journal all free all yours I told you guys it'd be worth it to stay until the end until my last breath and so I have a question for you guys did I keep my promise to make real business education accessible for everyone let me know in the chat give me a yes or a thumb or a flame
