  "transcript": "we try and build a story around what they're getting so you're not getting pictures you're not getting balloons it's about the memory that's associated with it and how much of the difference that'll be because I can promise you if Sally down the street does your balloons you will never remember them again how much value is it to know the entire experience of the birthday party the first thing when someone comes in is they see this huge experience and it frames the entire event have you ever heard the expression that the first impression is most important impression we are your first most important impression and so the cool thing is if you spend a thousand bucks with us you can save 10 grand on the rest of the party because if a rich girl wears fake jewelry no one knows\n"
