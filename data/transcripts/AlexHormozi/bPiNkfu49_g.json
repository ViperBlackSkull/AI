  "transcript": "I track lots of stuff and the more ways you track the more ways you can win if you track 100 stats then you only need one of them to go up so you feel like you made some progress and the second thing around the tracking is that I would look at like the biggest possible number so a lot of times you can see like the impressions of you know a post that you make even if you only got like 16 likes I got like a 100 Impressions and I thought to myself I was like well if there was a room of 100 people I'd be stoked like that would be awesome especially in the early days I would totally feel like that was worthwhile and so taking those little impression numbers and pretending that they were like micro events that I was making the work or the content for all of a sudden made it feel worth it for me\n"
