  "transcript": "there is this lonely period that always happens when you start growing because it happens is that you're too big for the old friend group but you're not quite big enough for the group that you want to get into so you kind of have this path in the Middle where you just kind of like keep trudging along but like every single person who's accomplished anything material has been in your exact same shoes and you just keep going you go into the communities you see the people who are adding value to those communities and you message them you find the givers cuz givers recognize givers almost immediately you can see the people who are always giving more above and beyond and you can understand they get the game but if you just start by giving to a whole bunch of people who are where you want to be you'll get more back even if nine out of 10 don't give you anything back\n"
