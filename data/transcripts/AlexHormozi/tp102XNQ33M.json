  "transcript": "when my cat Bill died I was super bummed cuz I really liked the cat and he died at like 18 months and I remember being sad about it I was like why am I sad I feel like it's not fair that he lived such a short life I was like okay so that means that I had an expectation that he would live longer than he did I was like what if cats only lived 6 months and I got to danging out with Bill for 18 months well then I'd be like well I mean he lived a good long life I mean I got him three times longer than most people get their cats and so then all of a sudden like my sadus was like it shifted to like more of an appreciation for the time that I had with them it was simply just shifting my expectation around what I expected\n"
