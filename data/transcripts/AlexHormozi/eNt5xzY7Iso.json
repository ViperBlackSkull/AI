  "transcript": "rest is productive if it increases your work per unit of time over an extended Horizon if I sleep eight hours a day and I watch Netflix for four hours a day but that allows me to work 12 hours a day straight then those four hours where I watch Netflix are productive in that the other 12 hours my total increase in output goes up if I work those extra four hours would I get more work done giving four more hours if my work output drops to such a low point my answer would probably be no because it would not only decrease during those four hours but then the next day I would not have recovered and then my starting point of output per unit of time would drop so\n"
