  "transcript": "I have difficulty ascribing reasons to current behaviors because I think we just don't know why who knows I know that I am this way I know that I behave in these ways in these conditions they are what they are and I think a lot of people I'm not saying this good or bad I'm just saying I have observed that many people will create stories to justify well I never got chocolate as a kid and that's why I eat chocolate now I'm like well maybe you just black chocolate maybe it has nothing to do with the fact you didn't have this kid maybe if you had it as a kid you'd still eat a lot of chocolate it has nothing to do with that and so people use circumstances to explain current reality as though it's a reason for rather than just like accepting it for what it is which is I just am this way\n"
