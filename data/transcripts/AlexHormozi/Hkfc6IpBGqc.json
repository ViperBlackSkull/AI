  "transcript": "Sundays are an interesting Vibe like I love Sundays there's a nice thing about like closing eight deals on Sunday before everyone else starts on Monday there are seven days in a week and people do spend money all seven we can increase sales by 133% by also selling on Sunday cuzz we do pay for everything else on those days I mean I would say take a different day of the week off unless you're religious like days are days\n"
