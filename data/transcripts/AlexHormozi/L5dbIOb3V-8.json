  "transcript": "the reality is that most people don't change most people live the same 6 months a 100 times in a row and then they die they go to the same places they make the same jokes they have the same Small Talk they work the same job and then they die because they were never willing to be uncomfortable because they were never willing to change and a lot of people get real uncomfortable when I talk about this stuff but most people are average and most people stay stuck in the same patterns they live the same 6 months for 40 straight years and never change and so if you want to be exceptional then you will often have to be the exception\n"
