  "transcript": "I've eaten dessert virtually every night for 20 years and I've been able to maintain a six-pack for that entire period of time is you have to figure out what your goal is either trying to get bigger you're trying to get smaller from there you start at number seven all the way up to 21. you go from Extreme Weight Loss to moderate weight loss to maintenance to moderate weight gain to extreme weight gain so let's say I'm a 200 pound guy and I want to get leaner so I'm going to go to moderate cut and I'm going to say 10 and so I'm going to multiply 200 which is my weight times 10 which is this coefficient which gives me 2 000 calories here's step three you multiply your weight 200 pounds again you multiply it by one means 200 grams of protein every pound of lean meat is 100 grams of protein so if you need 200 grams you need two pounds we have 2 000 calories and we know we have to eat 200 grams of protein all you have to do is figure out where you want to get your 200 grams of protein from and figure out how many calories are in that thing so I subtract my 200 grams of protein and the calories associated with those meals from my 2000 in this example and I would have 880 calories left over those 880 calories you can do whatever you want with them\n"
