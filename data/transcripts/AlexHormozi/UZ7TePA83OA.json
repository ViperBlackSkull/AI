  "transcript": "I'm always amazed at the amount of people who are like man this is hard and they somehow say that like it's a bad thing if it's hard good it means no one else will do it more for you the level of difficulty that you have to go through in order to get whatever you want is literally the barrier that everyone else has to go through in order to achieve it too and so the bigger the goal that you have the bigger the obstacles that you have to get over which is why so few people will get it which is what makes it worthwhile to begin with\n"
