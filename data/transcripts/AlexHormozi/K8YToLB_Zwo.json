  "transcript": "I always like being casual positive day one that doesn't mean I need to have crazy margins they want but I want to be casual positives they want so that this thing isn't feeding off me it's feeding on itself and then I can double down on feeding as much of that profit as possible as reinvestment in infrastructure or media to grow the business and I do it faster that way rather than pocketing it because when you're pocketing the cash from the business it means that you feel like you will get a better risk-adjusted return outside of the business and so if you leave the money in the business then it means that you feel like you will get a better risk of just a return I have advised many small business owners to take cash out of the business because it teaches them how to make a profit like not a story of profit someday but actually do that because when I had my six gyms I reinvested the whole way through and then I lost them all so I probably would have taken more money during that period of time and I might not have gone as fast now that I no longer need that from a risk basis me taking the money out and putting in the s p versus me taking the money out and putting in acquisition.com and how that will compound I believe will dramatically outperform the market\n"
