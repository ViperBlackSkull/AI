  "transcript": "I do believe that Brands can change over time if you are one shade to the right one shade to the right one shade to the right you can slowly move a brand now whenever you make that move you will lose some people who liked the thing that you had before and you will gain some people that like the new thing and the idea of repositioning or directing a brand is making sure that that trade-off is positive it's like the local band that you know has that local you know Vibe whatever they go a little bit more mainstream and then all their early fans are like they sold out but what they really did was they trade a small group of people for a much larger group people and more people like this brand than the old brand because if they like the old brand they would have already been big\n"
