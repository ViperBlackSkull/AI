  "transcript": "one of my favorite quotes if it's worth doing it's worth doing well the reason it's so important in my opinion is not the way that most people think of it most people think of that as oh you should do a good job but it's actually more important when you think about it in reverse which is that most things aren't worth doing what that means is that you only have a limited bandwidth of time and energy that you can allocate to doing anything well if you want to get the most leverage all of us have the same number of hours every day but some people move significantly faster and it's because they do fewer things better rather than trying to do everything well and in so doing do nothing\n"
