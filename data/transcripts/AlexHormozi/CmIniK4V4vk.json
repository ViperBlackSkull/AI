  "transcript": "calves were actually my weakest body part for a very long time and I actually had a girlfriend say why don't you train your calves and I had been training them for like three years the fact that she asked me that ruined my day and then I didn't wear shorts for three years I did what Arnold did and started training him first every workout and I've been doing it since and then I had only been wearing pants for so long that I forgot that I stopped wearing shorts so I was like man I'm getting really hot I should buy some shorts so I bought some shorts and I was looking at myself in the mirror and I was like oh hello and it was three years since I had seen it my cat looked way better it'd been so long and I just forgot why I was training calves first and then people started being like Oh your calves aren't bad now 10 years in\n"
