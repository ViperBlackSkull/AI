  "transcript": "I get a lot of messages how do I find my Layla or more specifically how do I make my wife into Layla which is a weird message to get be like a woman saying like how can I make my man taller it's just not going to happen Layla has never tried to change me and I've never really tried to change her so I think that making sure that you're picking somebody who has the same long-term goal as you has the same values as you the single greatest one is you want to grow they want to grow growth is also another word for change which means that if you have two people who are changing you just better hope they'd be changing the same direction\n"
