  "transcript": "I used to get nervous for presenting because I didn't know how to not be nervous so the two main things that I found are one is only talk about stuff that you know and so when I was doing high school presentations I'd be doing something on the Civil War and like I didn't know what I was talking about I just wrote something down cuz I had to have a speech that was 10 minutes long and the second thing is that I didn't practice I thought that writing the speech was the practice and that's like 10% of it the other 90% is how many times you go through it end to end and you'll be amazed at how much better your presentation gets if you actually go through it 20 times before you give it and so one is that I only talk about stuff I know and two is that I make sure it's not the first time I've said it\n"
