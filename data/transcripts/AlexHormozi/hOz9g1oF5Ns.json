  "transcript": "if you've ever looked at pictures from your past or you look at a picture of you with old friends doing something we tend to feel these feelings of nostalgia what is Nostalgia so to me Nostalgia is gratitude in the present for past circumstances and what's interesting about Nostalgia is that for whatever reason we're able to kind of look past all of the minutia of how we were feeling our moods and we're able to kind of like see big picture the things that we are grateful for I tried to do this I woke up thinking to myself if I were 85 years old and I got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as I am now to experience my life as though I'm experiencing the day that I'm about to live from my 85 year old self seeing it again if I wake up and I go I remember when we used to live here this is so nice for whatever reason gratitude journals the meditations things like that like I don't feel that but thinking about my 85 year old self being able to re-experience life through my 32 year old body as though I'm going through it the second time the first time it's really shifted how I see things\n"
