  "transcript": "there's an exceptional book by Patrick lenion called the motive and she asked me to read it for like two years and I just didn't because I'm a wonderful husband it's like a 100 pages I read it in 90 minutes before she woke up one day it was like sitting on the counter I was like ah I'll read it and she came in to like have coffee with me in the morning and I just looked at her I was like I get it I'm really sorry I highly recommend if you're a small business owner or you're an operator you're someone who actually runs your business read the motive I was the bad guy in the example and it shows what it looks like to be a good operator of a business and it was literally the exact opposite of everything I did\n"
