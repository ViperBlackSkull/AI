  "transcript": "the easiest upsells in the world is that you can sell more of what you just offered them you can sell better of what you just offered them you can also sell new or different something that's complimentary so you can sell fries with a Coke you can sell a burger and then add in fries or add in a Coke and then each of those you can upsize you can supersize them that's more and then if you had a better version of coke you say well do you want organic Coke just get creative and think what else did this person want and one of the easiest things to do is just ask them what else can I do to make this easier for you and then sell that\n"
