  "transcript": "uh one of my early mentors told me about flyers I put out 300 Flyers one guy called me back so I called the mentor back up and I was like hey what the heck this didn't work I just put out 300 total he just laughed he's like 300 test with 5,000 then we do 5,000 a day after that I was like 5,000 a day yeah like 15,000 flowers a month when he said that I had this huge realization that I might have been doing the right thing all along but I was just doing far too little of it and at that point I decided that whenever someone gave me advice I wouldn't let the volume of activity that I had done committing to a plan to be the reason it failed\n"
