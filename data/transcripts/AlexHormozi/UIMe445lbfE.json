  "transcript": "what effects do personality and Charisma have on success my answer would be a lot if when other people are around you they hate being around you and they have another person that they enjoy being around they will prefer to be around the other person more and if a lot of interactions in your career are being around and communicating with other people then I would say that a big portion of success has to do with how well you communicate sales is entirely communication marketing is more or less communication often times it is some of the most valuable work that can happen in business\n"
