  "transcript": "if you're starting a business the most expensive Equity that you ever give away is day one and so unless somebody has money you don't have skills you don't have or time you don't have you shouldn't partner if you do decide to partner because you do have somebody's really good product or somebody's really good at marketing and sales the split on the equity doesn't need to be equal so one person can be a 90% owner and somebody else can be 10 the question is just how much risk you take on if neither of you take a paycheck and one is 90 one is 10 a tougher sell but if you pay somebody then you can give them 2% I need to have books like bookkeeping it doesn't mean I necessarily need to partner with a bookkeeper you pay the bookkeeper I would almost always rather start things on my own market and sell get a little bit of cash flow and then bring someone in at a big discount because now I already have a working model and there's a huge gap between I have this idea and I have people paying me that as soon as this thing happens all the equity in the business now becomes valuable which means I need to give a little bit away to get a really good person\n"
