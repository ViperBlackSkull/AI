  "transcript": "you can flip the fact that you have nothing going for you with you have nothing to lose you can take lots of risks very quickly and end up in the exact same position you are which is nothing meaning you should be able to do more things faster rather than do fewer things because you don't have a great life or things going for you and so I think if people flip that a lot more people would take action because they actually realize the advantage of their position\n"
