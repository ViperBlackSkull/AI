  "transcript": "i was sitting in the audience watching people speak on stage i was always like it has to be more complicated than this like it can't just be what they're saying and now having been on the other side of this i've got this framed in my mind which is advanced people always do the basics and the meaning of that is that most people who are casting stones and saying it has to be more complicated that aren't even doing it and the thing is is that when you scale all scaling really is is doing all the things you did in the beginning of your business as well as your before just way more of it and that's what makes you advanced it's not complexity it's scale\n"
