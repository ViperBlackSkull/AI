  "transcript": "the two biggest life hacks that I've had for being productive that I still do number one I wake up early and I start working pretty much immediately I'm not transiting anywhere I'm not getting ready I mean from the time my eyes are open to the time I'm working it's probably 45 minutes and the second one is that I just don't schedule anything before lunch we're pretty Vigilant about that even with all the demands of time and all that stuff I have until basically 12 30 every day that I don't take really any meetings if I start working at 5 30 and I have until 12 30. I have a full work day completely uninterrupted every day before I do things like this\n"
