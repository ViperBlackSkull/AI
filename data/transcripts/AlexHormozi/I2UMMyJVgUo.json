  "transcript": "when I started to start making content I hired a YouTube agency said hey just so you know I will follow the system that you outlined for 10 years before I need to see an Roi I was like to be clear I want to make progress I want to see that our videos are doing better he said I have never had anyone in my entire life ever talk to me about a 10-year time Rising for anything every client I sign up is like I need to Roi in 90 days or I'm not going to pay you work if this doesn't make me money in a month like I'm out and he's like and it completely shifted the way that I have approached my business just seeing how you approached YouTube and so I'm like of course it's going to take a while I'm competing against guys I've been doing it for 10 years of course they're better than I am why would I expect to beat those guys but I'd like to be better and as long as I have a path towards that I'm satisfied that's all that people in my opinion should focus on now if you're not getting better and you're putting the real time into the thing then it means you need somebody to give you better feedback\n"
