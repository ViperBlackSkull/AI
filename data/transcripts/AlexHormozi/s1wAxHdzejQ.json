  "transcript": "I want to tell you about the most powerful sales tactic that I have learned and I never learned it from a book I actually learned it by accident we had like 100 new customers are supposed to come in and I ran out of one of the key products I had ladies come in the first half of the day and able to get the products and then some of their friends who signed up with them came in the second half today and we're like hey my friend Sandy told me that I need X X Y and Z and I was like oh we don't have Z anymore and so rather than me try and skirt around like this clear item that was on the list I said hey by the way you can get this one for cheaper down the street at Costco after I made that one crossout I was like but you do want this and this from us and they're like okay cool as soon as I made that switch from saying hey you don't need to buy this one you can get that from over there everyone bought what I recommended afterwards if you believe in the stuff that you sell you can create an environment where someone will trust you faster by giving them a reason to trust you that you acted in their self-interest rather than your own so that they can feel like you're not trying to take advantage of them\n"
