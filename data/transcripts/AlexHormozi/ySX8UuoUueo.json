  "transcript": "and I remember when I was in Middle School I learned this lesson where I was in Spanish class and there was you know there was the class clown or whatever and I was like I want people to laugh at my jokes and so I made a joke that was a joke that that guy probably would have made and it was a self-deprecating joke but the thing is is that like that guy was kind of a bum and like him making self-deprecating jokes made sense because of the context of who he was but I was a straight A student who was really good at sports yeah and no one thought it was funny and fast forward you know 10 years there was a joke that had in our fraternity which is there's nothing funny about an in- shaped body and so I agree with you and that the the medium of the message matters and so people won't root for you because we use the the delivery mechanism usually as a filter for whether we should even trust the source\n"
