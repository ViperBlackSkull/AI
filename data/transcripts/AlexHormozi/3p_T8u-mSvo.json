  "transcript": "bad Partnerships happen all the time and it's usually because when I take the trash out I think it's a 10 out of 10 effort and when you see me take the trash out you think it's a two out of 10 effort and then we both think we've got uneven work because you always score your work higher than someone else's and so the easiest way to prevent bad Partnerships is having clear communication before you get into Partnerships but if you are in one you have to say hey these are my expectations you are not meeting them this no longer works so we either need to change your behavior or we need to change this partnership which one do you want to do and then you go from there and either means you dissolve the business it means one of you bu the other person out or one of you says you know what I have been slacking I've had a bunch of stuff going on at home you're right I'm going to step up my game\n"
