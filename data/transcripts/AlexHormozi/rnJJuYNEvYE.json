  "transcript": "if life were a game and all of us are given a token to like enter like a casino we sit down at the table to play poker right and everybody's playing everybody's got cards and we got to play the handward dog and depending on our level of skill we amass more and more chips throughout the game at the end of the game the difference between the real world and in the game of life in the real world you go and you can cash out your chips and you walk out with money and there you go there's your day but I feel like in the casino of life you get tapped on the shoulder by the Grim Reaper he says your time's up and then all your tips get pushed right back to the middle of the table and then you leave the casino empty-handed because it was a fake game with fake rules it didn't matter we accumulate these chips that I'm just gonna push back in the middle again that other people are going to play on the reason that that analogy became real for me is like I bought this piece of land and I was like that's neat how many people have owned this piece of land the guy before me owned it and the guy before him owned it and the guy before him done it and they were like this is mine they're just chips that just get played with and they just get amassed and then they get redistributed it just doesn't matter it's really for nothing and so like if you want you can build something that you think is cool but like at the end of the day like we're just gonna catch the chips\n"
