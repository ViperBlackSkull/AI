  "transcript": "if you spend all your time trying to beat the competition then you basically live your life in reaction to them which makes it very hard to orient towards a goal and so by ignoring everyone else and just saying like what is our Max version of us do we move way faster than if we're trying to go against them it's more like we can be dissatisfied every day versus what we think we could achieve meanwhile they might be dusted miles behind us but if we had tried to only beat them we might only be a meter or two in front of them and look like we're in the pack but we don't want to look like we're in the pack we want to look like we're just forging our own path and doing our own thing that other people can choose to emulate but by doing will always be behind us they can make us their competition but we will never compete with them\n"
