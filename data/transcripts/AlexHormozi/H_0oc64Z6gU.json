  "transcript": "billionaires can lose it all and then get it right back and the reason that you can't is cuz you don't see reality clearly it's about being a realist it's moving the emotion outside of the facts and making decisions based on the facts and I feel like that's a tool that has become less and less and less common with more and more and more internet and more and more and more propaganda in terms of making people believe that their feelings are what actually matter and how you should make decisions in reality especially in business that's not going to get you very far it's going to get you broke\n"
