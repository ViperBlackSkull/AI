  "transcript": "if you feel like you are the output of your life like at the end of your life who you are is the thing that is the thing that you became then competition is good for you like if you look back at that person would you want that person to have no challenges like if you were at the end of your life and you looked back would you be like I'm glad I overcame no adversity I'm glad no one ever put me to the test I'm glad I never got to see what I was truly capable of you would never say that we just don't like going through it in the short term but we do want the outcome of it and so I think that if you just accept that that's the price tag for the person you want to be then you just pay it willingly\n"
