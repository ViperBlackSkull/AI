  "transcript": "if you think about like when people die the only thing that's left is like books like the only thing that has like stayed for 2,000 5,000 years is like written word and so I think there's something magical about that and so you know I spend a lot of time trying to make it really really good and I think there's a big difference between like publishing a book and Publishing a great book the value that people will get is so far in Access of what they pay that they tell their friends about it if you can achieve that ratio then the product takes off it becomes its own marketing either it's good enough that it will promote itself right why would I promote it because if people aren't telling their friends that it's good then why would I want anyone else to read it\n"
