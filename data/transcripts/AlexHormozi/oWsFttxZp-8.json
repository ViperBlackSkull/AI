  "transcript": "the company that happens in your earning is just like the game of cash flow basically with this little board game where everybody starts at the same you roll dice and you keep moving along the board and as soon as you graduate high school you had the option of starting a job and start earning more money immediately after high school or you could go to college wait 4 years and then make more money after that the theory of the game is correct the fact that nowadays college is massively overpriced and undervalued and some other career paths are as well doesn't disprove the idea that the longer you can delay your earning cycle the more you are compounding your learning unto itself\n"
