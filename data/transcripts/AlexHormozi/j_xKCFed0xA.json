  "transcript": "leverage as we Define it is the difference between what you put in and what you get out and it's volume times leverage equals output so it's how many times you do something times how much you get for each time you do it equals output so if I do 100 sales calls and I have no skill then I will get fewer sales than somebody who does the same hundred sales calls and has much higher skill so skills create leverage you get more for what you put in\n"
