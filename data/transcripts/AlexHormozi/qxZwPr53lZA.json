  "transcript": "I was so against happiness as a concept for a very long time it's part of my ENT like I'm not a happy person that's fine stating that got me out of all the pressure I would put on myself for not being happy so I was super unhappy and then I would put pressure and have anxiety about why I wasn't happy and then that was like a self-fulfilling cycle then I came up with happiness as my Mantra and I was like I'm just going to do and then I kind of forgot about happiness as a concept for a while but I identified with somebody who wasn't happy and that that was okay and that gave me a lot of peace\n"
