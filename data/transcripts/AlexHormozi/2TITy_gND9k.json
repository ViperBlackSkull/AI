  "transcript": "the only reason we fly private is because it saves time you walk up to the plane you get on the plane and then you walk off the plane like that's it private flying in my opinion has the most benefit for the shortest travels and the least benefit for the long travel so the going through security and dealing with the hassle if you have a five and a half hour flight five and a half hours versus like seven hours of Transit the day's screwed it doesn't materially change a lot but on a short travel where you're going like sub two hours you can cut it in half or buy a third by flying private\n"
