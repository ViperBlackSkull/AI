  "transcript": "going into debt to gain education fundamentally makes sense it's got to be the right education that can make you money you got to get a return on it yeah Elon was saying something about how neuralink in the future it's going to be such a competitive advantage that they could price it at whatever they want because once you have it you'll be so much more able than anyone who doesn't have it that you could so easily pay off the price of the thing that's how it should work conceptually this is the simplest example that I have so A friend of mine has a 17 year old daughter she got a job at a bowling alley and she makes minimum wage he said why don't you become a phlebotomist he was like well I don't want to spend the money it's like it's 500 bucks and it's a two-day certification and then after you have that you make 25 an hour she didn't have the money now she could save it to get the 500 or she could take a loan for the 500 bucks and pay back in a week right because she has higher earning capacity she could either save for eight weeks from her her bowling alley or she could take a loan for the 500 do the two days and then pay it off in a week at that one week she now has seven more weeks of earning capacity at her new level and she'd be net positive on the next seven weeks of earning right and so that's just a micro example of like what skill investing does\n"
