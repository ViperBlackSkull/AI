  "transcript": "yes you absolutely can because the question is why is it a quote bad habit the question is like in what way does this quote habit impair you if you're an investor and you spend all of your money that would be a bad habit it would impair you from actually investing right but if you were an Olympic lifter there's plenty of foreign Olympic lifters that smoke between sets because nicotine's a stimulant and so how are we defining bad and so I think that the Habit that you're defining is bad you have to clearly tie to how it stops you from doing the input that you need for your path to success and so these are not like binary yes or no's it's against what goal and to what degree and so can you decrease it to the degree that it's not a huge detractor then sure and maybe if you do that long term you'll be able to stick with your thing for a longer period of time because you balance some of the things that you enjoy in life\n"
