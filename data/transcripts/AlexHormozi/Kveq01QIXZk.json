  "transcript": "most poor people don't perceive opportunities and so then they leave their job and then they start going into business for themselves and they have to look for opportunities but then the better you get at looking for opportunities the more opportunities you see and so in the beginning what got you to start getting into business for yourself was the recognizing opportunities which is good but then you start seeing so many opportunities that you start trying to pursue all of them and you only need one big opportunity to set yourself up for life and so you just need to make sure that you're picking the best one and ignoring everything else because you can only live one life and you can't pursue endless opportunities\n"
