  "transcript": "if you're an ugly dude recommend having a hat and a beard because the Hat covers the top half of your face and the beard covers the bottom half of your face so it leaves as much of your face up to the imagination of the opposite sex I'm a big hat fan I've got my instant nap Creator whenever I need it if I'm lifting I can go into lifting mode because usually I put my head closer to something so the bill doesn't get in the way it works\n"
