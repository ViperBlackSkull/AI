  "transcript": "I got a lot of positive feedback on investing your money in the SME 500 rather than the S P 500 because when you're starting out a thousand dollars a month or two thousand dollars a month although that's a lot of money for many people you'd be better served taking that money and increasing your capacity to make money and so rather than putting a thousand dollars in hoping that it's going to get you eight percent so you're gonna get eighty dollars at the end of the year take the thousand dollars to be able to learn a skill that might be able to pay you an extra twenty thousand dollars a year and early on that discrepancy between what you can put in and what you can get out is unmatched anywhere in the market\n"
