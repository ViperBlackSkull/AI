  "transcript": "you're going to lose sleep you'll doubt whether it'll work you'll stress to make ends meet you won't finish your to-do list you wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years this is what hard feels like and that's okay a lot of people say like entrepreneurship is hard but I was like it's such a vague term I was like what about it makes it difficult and the thing that I keep coming back to that makes entrepreneurship difficult is that you have a known cost for an unknown payoff you know every day that you're continuing to pay these bills both in time energy money but you don't get the paycheck back you don't get the reward back and sometimes it's a week sometimes it's a month sometimes it's a year and sometimes more realistically it's years plural before you get the paycheck back and the paycheck isn't always money sometimes it's just knowing that the thing you said was going to happen happens or that maybe your wife looks at you a different way or maybe it's your your family that looks at you a different way you want status when your community whatever it is and it just comes down to this absolute Soul crushing uncertainty with the idea that no one can actually tell you and you have this unquenched desire to be able to predict the future while at the same time knowing that you can't\n"
