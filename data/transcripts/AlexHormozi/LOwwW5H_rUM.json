  "transcript": "one of the most uncomfortable things that I ever did was be successful in the eyes of my peers move into a different room where I was the least successful person and then feel this huge deficit between where I was and where they were and so one of the fastest shortcuts to getting close to your goals is finding people that are already there so that you can become painfully aware of your own deficits and then work to improve them change your environment change your behavior\n"
