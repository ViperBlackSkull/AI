  "transcript": "I learned this tactic from Eminem that he used in rap but actually make sales way more effective he always used to talk about owning all the negatives you want to say every negative thing you possibly can about yourself so no one else can but as salesman you can actually stack the deck in your favor using all the negative and then reversing it into positive here's how it works it's all around the word butt normally if you've ever heard people like oh he's saying something good where's the butt because everyone is trained to emphasize what happens after the word butt but when you're persuading what you can do is rather than say good thing butt bad thing you flip it so you say all the bad stuff our program is really long it's very difficult it's complex but it works better than anything else you've ever tried the second half the send becomes magnified because of the damaging admissions that but Amplified\n"
