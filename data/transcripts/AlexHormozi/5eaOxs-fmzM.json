  "transcript": "whenever a business starts you always have debt it just depends on what kind of debt you want so you can either have financial debt so you take on debt from investors then you can hire people and pay people well you can not take on financial debt and then you incur management debt because you have people who are under skilled for the jobs and then you have to keep training all these new people because you can't afford to pay the right people like there's always debt that you encourage it depends on which type of debt you'd rather pay down later\n"
