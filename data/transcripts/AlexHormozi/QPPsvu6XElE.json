  "transcript": "something called the Dunning Krueger effect the more you learn in a specific skill the more you realize you don't know and so if right now you're young and you think you know a lot I want to tell you it's a psychological fallacy like you actually know nothing like you think you know it which is why it's a fallacy and the reason that some people are older have to stain for people who are younger is because of this psychological effect people who are older who have had more experience realize they know less and then see somebody who's younger thinks they know more and they realize the discrepancy and how ignorant it is and you just look stupid\n"
