  "transcript": "I did a legal internship in France translating legal documents from French to English just terrible work there was this partner who was there and she like did one of these like peaked her head into my hole or whatever they where they kept me to like translate documents she was like you know how's it coming or whatever and I was like I was like man I'm just working really hard and she just like looked at me and she just laughed and I was like what the what and she was like you don't even know how to work and then she just walked away at my position now I 100% agree like I didn't know how to work and so I really genuinely believe that succeeding isn't hard learning how to try is hard once you learn how to try if you just try at anything compared to other people you'll win\n"
