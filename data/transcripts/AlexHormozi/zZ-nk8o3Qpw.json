  "transcript": "I absolutely acknowledge that there are Pros to being super hydrated but for me there's one massive con you have to get up to pee all the time the other part of is that you actually deplete your body of minerals usually a faster rate than you put them back in and so a lot of people who actually drink a lot of water end up getting more cramps feeling shittier having headaches and I experienced all this stuff I actually went completely the other direction and I only drink when I'm thirsty what a lot of people don't know is that a lot of food has water in it right about a pound of fruit every day 90 of that's water I think the obsession about water for me if you're like dude I love drinking water then drink water I don't care I am sharing what worked for me and maybe if you're somebody who pees a lot it disrupts your day and it disrupts your sleep then consider not drinking as much water\n"
