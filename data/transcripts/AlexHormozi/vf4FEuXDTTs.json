  "transcript": "so I was in the car and a friend of ours and they had their son in the back they were talking about Chanel she was talking about how there was this guy who had a hookup or was the manager at the Chanel who can get you pieces that aren't normally available whatever and she turns back to her son and she says you always have to know these people because they're the ones who give you access to everything else they give you things that no one else gets access to but when I heard her say that the immediate thought that came into my head is I'd rather just be that guy and then I have access to everyone whenever I want and everyone's trying to maintain a relationship with me\n"
