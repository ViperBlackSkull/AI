  "transcript": "when I was single I actually ended up eating at Chipotle over 500 times and I found out only from my accountant when he looked at my financials and he was like is this mistake you ate 500 times at Chipotle and I was like well it's lunch and dinner 10 times a week yeah that makes sense and I like Chipotle because I could get 100 grams of protein each sitting when I was trying to get as many calories in as possible I would have two tortillas which were free each of those were 400 calories a pop I would get a bag of chips which was 700 calories and then I would have a bowl that had double rice double beans double meat which would be a pause double so I'd go half and half chicken steak because you get like one and a half each time and then I'd be like actually you know what let's make it a double and then they would put another half and half and when they do that they usually give you like a three quarter three quarter so it ended up being like a triple meat and then I would have Pico lettuce sour cream and I did that every day and it was just because it was cheaper for me than buying groceries and so I did it that way and it saved me so\n"
