  "transcript": "I have nothing on my calendars on Saturdays and Sundays and I have nothing until 3:00 typically during the week one o'clock is my absolute hard stop but I ask the team to push everything until 3: so that I can actually work on the stuff that matters and then Mondays I have for meetings so how do I keep it all organized is that I have people who are focusing on it and they let me know if they need me which most of the time I ask them not to need me\n"
