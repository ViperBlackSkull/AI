  "transcript": "FTX collapsed overnight and more stuff like this is going to happen in the upcoming recession oftentimes banking institutions Etc over leverage meaning they basically gamble people's money people like us who put money in the bank and so here's an easy thing that you can do to protect yourself against that instead of going to Banks instead of putting your money in Banks you can actually buy treasury bonds which are both safer and pay four percent rather than point zero zero zero one percent like Banks do anybody can do this and the nice thing is you can trade in and out of them instantly so they're still liquid but what I recommend doing is actually waiting for them to come do and just buy 6 12 18 24s and then waiting six months once that comes due take the money and the interest and buy another 24 month that way you're always cycling and getting new cash in and it's safe\n"
