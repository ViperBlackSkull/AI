  "transcript": "if you continue to make content and your audience can compound month over month over month then it means that like no matter how big the company gets it can still grow by 10% each month cuz those people tell other people right if you have a compounding vehicle for Capital then would mean that like we have a way that we can reinvest Capital every X period of time and get y return and it doesn't matter whether we're investing a million dollar or $100 million we're still going to get the same return and so that is something that can compound over time you pretty much have to have a compounding vehicle to unlock crazy levels of growth uh and Enterprise Value and that's what most companies who are going to acquire for the several hundred million and up are going to look for is that there's at least one vehicle that that compounds independent of scale\n"
