  "transcript": "the most important page in the book is always the table of contents because it tells you what's the content inside the book it also shows you how they organize the thinking process and if you're like well I kind of really understand this stuff already I'm going to just go to the part that I don't understand I want to learn more about your value per second self-imposed on a book can go way up and then if they totally blow you out of the water with the thing that you're most interested on then you can start working your way down what was my second most important third most important fourth most important and then the moment the value per second becomes more redundant on stuff you already know then it's like well if my fifth most important thing I already knew a lot about and the rest of the stuff I'm less interested in then I maximize the value of the book for me\n"
