  "transcript": "life is hard believing it should be easy makes it harder it's like signing a contract by saying life should be easy and every moment it isn't easy I will be unhappy like that makes it more difficult than just being willing to weather the harder times when I do get down on myself cuz I do too I try and think what expectation spoken or unspoken am I making of the universe that I feel is unfulfilled and is that expectation reasonable\n"
