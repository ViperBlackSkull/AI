  "transcript": "so I think about death all the time it's probably the thing that I think the most about and I think that influences how I see time and also how it influences agency what actions I'm willing to take despite the Judgment of others it might be because I have more insecurity than everyone that I think like man I want to do this thing and then I hear all these other voices of reasons why I shouldn't do it or why somebody else will say that's wrong whatever and so I think I've had to come up with a lot of these devices to get around my own insecurities to take action despite those insecurities and the biggest one that I think about is that it doesn't matter whether I achieve all of my goals or I don't achieve of the goals in three generations I'll be forgotten and the only people who were naying against me will also be dead\n"
