  "transcript": "I would have lunch with my grandfather three times a week so he was 90 old guy so I would go to the nursing home and listening to him talk about the regrets that you had in life it's so much more painful to watch someone who has no options left when I left Baltimore one of the sad parts is I was one of the only people that kind of like kept him lucid and after that no one really visited him no one really did anything and so I think he he just rolled downhill I think the lunches might have been the only thing that he looked forward to he would repeat the same lessons and he always used to say he's like you have two hands and one brain use them\n"
