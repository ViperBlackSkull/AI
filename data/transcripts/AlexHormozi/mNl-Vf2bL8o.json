  "transcript": "a good buddy of mine Dr cashy taught an autistic kid how to read he came to train the child on how to read with a bag of Skittles when the kid would read a word he would give them a Skittle when he would read more words in a row than he ever had a record he would give him two Skittles so he rewarded the behavior and then he had big bonus rewards when he would unlock a new level he kept doing that and within one afternoon he had him reading a full page it doesn't have to be complex it's just what is the behavior that I want to reward how can I reward more of it now none of it was punishing he didn't smack him when he messed up when he read less he still gave him one to reward him for the activity and then when he read more he gave him extra reward and what happens over time is that the Skittles become a proxy for approval because then you collect the Skittles cuz you know that this means you did a good job\n"
