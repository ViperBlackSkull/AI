  "transcript": "we grew a three million person audience in 18 months and what we didn't do was say hey like And subscribe and follow after every single one of our videos people don't respond to more than one call to action if you want someone to do something only tell them one thing to do at a time and if you want to tell them multiple things to do tell them one thing to do at different times within the content you can have someone go to your podcast you can have someone like you can have someone subscribe but not at the same time tell them the first thing you want them to do and if you have a multitude step process then tell them the second thing to do after they've done the first thing and if you want bonus points to get a higher percentage people even to do that frame the second thing as a continuation of the first because what happens is psychologically this becomes commitment and consistency so people like to see themselves as not wasting their time and being consistent with what they just did if you show them that they incur a cost by taking the first step they'll be more likely to take the second\n"
