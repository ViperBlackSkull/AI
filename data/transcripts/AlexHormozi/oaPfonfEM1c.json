  "transcript": "confidence without evidence is delusion the idea that you aren't confident if you don't feel confident right now is okay because the question is what are you trying to be confident about like confidence as a word is the percentage likelihood that you have that what you think will happen will happen like what is our confidence score on this metric and so the same thing applies to a person what is our confidence that when Johnny says he will do this it will happen and so we have our own confidence metric for ourself which is a percentage likely that we will do what we say we're going to do the way that you can increase that confidence is to have more evidence that you've done things when you said you would them in the past I think it's about looking retrospectively and thinking you know what story can I tell around this data that would give me more evidence that I actually do have some of these traits that I didn't think about\n"
